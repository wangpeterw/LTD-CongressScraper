My election would not have been possible without the efforts of Maya Angelou, Shirley Chisholm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Sojourner Truth, Rosa Parks, and many other sheroes who came before me. These women championed civil rights and women's rights and fought oppression so that African-American women could have a voice in politics.  When I was elected, I became the 100th woman to serve in the 114th Congress, the 20th woman in the Congressional Black Caucus, and only the second African-American woman to represent North Carolina in That night was a historic win for women, but it was particularly special for African-American women.  Shirley Chisholm once said: ``Women must become revolutionary. There cannot be evolution but revolution.''  At a time when the President's Cabinet does not include a single African-American woman and just one African-American woman in the Senate, we are reminded that there is still much work to do.

If it sounds ridiculous, that is because it is.  WOTUS was flawed from the beginning. It has been held up in the courts since 2015.

942,topic-id,5236,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the nomination of Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Scott Pruitt is the right person to run the Agency, and we need to confirm him.  Over the past 8 years, the political leaders of the EPA have taken actions that have undermined the American people's faith in the They have pushed broad and sweeping regulations that have hurt our economy and have failed to protect our environment. These regulations include the so-called Clean Power This is a rule that will kill job growth in States like Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, and my home State of These also include regulations defining the term ``waters of the United States.'' This was a classic example of Washington overreach. The Agency brought irrigation ditches, plowed farm fields, and even parking lot puddles under Federal control. With both of these rules, dozens of State governments have had to take Washington to court. Why? Well, to try to stop the crippling effects of these Washington-based regulations.  The Agency's outrageous actions have extended beyond these rules and have had real consequences for many American families. According to the chamber of commerce, since 2008 this regulatory rampage by the EPA has destroyed 19,000 coal-mining jobs nationwide. In Kentucky, nearly 4 out of every 10 coal-mining jobs have disappeared over the past 8 years. Ohio and Pennsylvania have each lost more than 1,000 fossil fuel electric power jobs during the same period. In West Virginia, 5,200 coal-mining jobs have vanished just since 2011.  The total cost of all of this new redtape from the Environmental Protection Agency is more than $300 billion. The leadership at the EPA has failed. It has failed because a lot of their regulations are bad ideas.  That is not the only way the political leaders at the Agency have failed; they have actually hurt people and damaged the environment directly. In 2015, more than 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater spilled into the river at the Gold King Mine in The government Agency charged with protecting our environment actually caused this spill and poisoned a river. This was a direct result of negligence on the part of the Environmental Protection This plume of toxic liquid flowed downstream to New Mexico and polluted the Navajo Nation's main source of drinking water and irrigation water.  In the final days of the Obama administration, the EPA then denied $1.2 billion in damage claims from the farmers, the Native American tribes, and small businesses impacted by the EPA's own negligence.  In Flint, MI, old pipes and improperly treated water caused lead poisoning in children. When the leadership at the EPA learned of the issue, they failed to respond in a timely manner. The regional EPA administrator actually resigned following the incident.  For the last 8 years, the political leaders of this Agency have been reckless, irresponsible, and arrogant. Change is badly needed at the Environmental Protection Agency and Scott Pruitt will be that change. Mr.Pruitt has served as attorney general in the State of Oklahoma since 2011--6 years. He has worked to protect the environment in his State, while also working for the benefit of all the people of  He has taken on polluters. He has worked across party lines to do it. When poultry farmers in Arkansas, a neighboring State to Oklahoma, were increasing phosphorous levels in the Illinois River that runs between the States, he worked with Arkansas' Democratic attorney general on a solution. They found a way to reduce pollution and establish permanent standards.  Former Arkansas Attorney General McDaniel, a Democrat, called Pruitt a ``staunch defender of sound science and good policy as appropriate tools to protect the environment in his State.''  Scott Pruitt also helped negotiate a water rights settlement between tribes in The deal will help preserve scenic rivers and lakes so they can be enjoyed for generations to come.  Scott Pruitt also stood up to industry when they caused pollution. That is why the entire Oklahoma congressional delegation has endorsed his nomination. He has been an advocate for the environment in Oklahoma, and he will be an advocate for the environment in  When the EPA overstepped its mission, Attorney General Pruitt led the charge to rein in Big Government Washington overreach. Time after time, Scott Pruitt worked with other States to challenge the Agency when it exceeded its authority. Under his leadership, this Agency will respect the rule of law.  Attorneys general from 24 States have endorsed Scott Pruitt as someone who can protect the environment while also protecting State decisionmaking. He has also won the support of small businesses and farmers around the country. Groups like the National Federation of Independent Business, the U.Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Home Builders, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and many others have voiced their support for Mr. As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I take the nomination process very seriously. Our committee thoroughly vetted Mr.We held a confirmation hearing that lasted more than 6 hours. That is by far the longest confirmation hearing for an EPA Administrator on record.[[Page S1231]]During this hearing, Attorney General Pruitt was asked more than 200 questions by Members of the committee. We had four rounds of questions--an unprecedented number. Our Democratic colleagues on the committee noted during the hearing how fair the process was. They said how much they appreciated the opportunity to ask so many questions. After the hearing, committee members submitted another 1,078 written questions to Mr.Pruitt to answer for the record. Again, this is the most ever for a nominee to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection His answers were thoughtful, and they were thorough. That is why I was very disappointed to see the Democrats on the committee decide to boycott the meeting to vote on the Pruitt nomination.  The minority complained that he didn't answer enough questions. Democrats have even complained that he has not been vetted thoroughly enough. That is ridiculous. Scott Pruitt is the most thoroughly vetted nominee we have ever had to lead this Democrats are using delaying tactics to slow down the confirmation of many of this administration's most important nominees. These boycotts and delay tactics do nothing to protect our environment or the health of Democrats are engaged in nothing more than political theater. They are wasting time while the Environmental Protection Agency needs a new  Attorney General Pruitt has protected the environment in his home He is endorsed by his peers, and he has been thoroughly vetted for the job. He will make an excellent EPA It is time for the Senate to confirm him.  Mr.President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following items in support of Mr.Pruitt's nomination: First are two op-eds I authored, one is from FOX News that is entitled ``For Eight Years, the EPA Has Made Life Hard for Too Many That's About to Change.''  The second is from USA TODAY, entitled: ``The Strong Leader the EPA Needs.''  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some other items: a letter from Dustin McDaniel, Democrat and Arkansas former attorney general. In the letter, he writes that he ``saw firsthand how Attorney General Pruitt was able to bridge political divides and manage multiple agency agendas to reach an outcome that was heralded by most credible observers as positive and historic.''  Another item for the Record is a letter from 24 State attorneys general who wrote in support of Mr.Pruitt's qualifications.  Also for the Record is a letter I received from J.He is the director of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife In the letter, Mr.Strong directly refutes a New York Times article titled ``Scott Pruitt, Trump's EPA Pick, Backed Industry Donors over Regulators.''  Mr.Strong writes:       As a fifth generation Oklahoman and someone who has devoted      my career to natural resource protection, I take great pride      in the progress that has been made in improving Oklahoma's      land, air, water, and wildlife resources.  He goes on to say--       For the past six years, General Pruitt has been      instrumental in many of our successes and never asked me to      compromise regulatory efforts to benefit industry.  Also, I would like to include in the Record an op-ed by Ed Fite, the former agency administrator of the Oklahoma Scenic Rivers He writes:       Scott Pruitt is one who is committed to finding a balance      that protects and preserves our environment while at the same      time affords an opportunity for a robust economy to exist.      Achievement of one doesn't have to be exclusive of the other.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [FoxNews.com, 17, 2017]  Barrasso: For 8 Years the EPA Has Made Life Hard for Too Many                    That's About To Change                     (By John Barrasso, M.D.)       Seventy-five thousand dollars per day. That's how much the      Environmental Protection Agency threatened to fine a private      land owner in my home state of The crime: digging a      pond in his back yard.       This was an appalling overreach by the Obama      administration's EPA and its regulation of American's      property.       Sadly, this story is not unique.       For the past eight years, the EPA has abused and attacked      far too many hard-working American families.       A regulatory rampage by EPA has led to the loss of      thousands of coal mining jobs in Wyoming, West Virginia,      Ohio, Pennsylvania, and       Wisconsin is poised to lose more than 20,000 jobs in the      next decade because of the Obama administration's proposed      regulations on carbon emissions.       The misguided obsession of the EPA has created needless      economic burdens for It has, at the same time, put      people's health in danger.       Negligence on the part of the EPA resulted in more than 3      million gallons of toxic wastewater being dumped into a river      at the Gold King Mine in       The plume of toxic liquid flowed downstream to New Mexico      and polluted the Navajo Nation's main source of drinking and      irrigation water.       In Flint, Michigan, aging pipes and improperly treated      water caused lead poisoning in children. When EPA officials      learned of the pending disaster, they failed to respond.       The agency's misplaced priorities are harming state      governments as well.       North Dakota stands to lose more than $100 million in tax      revenue over the next four years because of the Obama      administration's ``clean power plan'' regulations. The state      will have to look to already-strapped families to make up the      difference or else cut back on services.       Disregard for the consequences of its actions has become      the trademark of the EPA for the last eight years. Policy      goals and talking points have consistently taken priority      over American families. This cannot be the case any longer.       As chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and      Public Works, I look forward to ushering in wholesale change      at the I will be doing it alongside a committed and      capable administrator.       President-elect Trump has named Oklahoma Attorney General      Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA and to overhaul the agency.      Attorney General Pruitt has seen the effects of over      regulation in his own state and has worked to stop them.       Pruitt has distinguished himself by challenging the Obama      administration on several of its most burdensome rules. He      stood up for Oklahomans against the EPA's extreme regulations      on greenhouse gasses, methane emissions, and cross state air      pollution. He took action against unworkable water rules and      air standards. He sued the federal government to make sure      that it was interpreting the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts      as Congress actually wrote them, not how it benefited      President Obama's political agenda.       Attorney General Pruitt is respected by his peers for the      work he has done. His work in Oklahoma protected the      environment and strengthened the economy by standing up for      states' rights. Attorneys general from 24 states authored a      letter in support of his nomination. They know he can and      will rein in       President-elect Trump has vowed that his administration      will overturn two federal regulations for every new one it      proposes. The administrator of EPA will play a vital role in      keeping that promise. He must make sure that the agency meets      its mission of protecting our environment--ensuring clean      water, air, and land--while allowing our economy to grow.       Our committee is taking up the nomination of Attorney      General Pruitt this week. I look forward to hearing more      about his vision for the agency and how he will help get      Americans back to work.

He negotiated a      historic water rights settlement with Indian tribes that      preserved the ecosystems of scenic lakes and rivers; he      worked with his Democrat counterpart in Arkansas to reduce      pollution in the Illinois River; and he represented the      interests of Oklahomans in rate cases against utility      companies and in numerous actions against those who      contaminated his state's air and water.       Attorney General Pruitt is committed to clean air and clean      water, and to faithfully executing the environmental laws      written by He believes that environmental      regulations should be driven by State and local governments--     a notion endorsed by Congress in the Clean Air Act and Clean      Water When our nation is confronted with issues      affecting the environment that are not covered by a      particular statute, Scott will come to Congress for a      solution, rather than inventing power for his agency. He      wholeheartedly believes in a strong Environmental Protection      Agency that carries out its proper duties, providing a      backstop to state and local regulators as they develop      environmental regulations suited to the needs of their own      communities.       Scott Pruitt is more than just an exemplary state attorney      general, he is also our friend. A man of deep faith who is      committed to his family and to his friends, Scott seeks      always to do the right thing. His friendship and leadership      have been invaluable to us over the years.       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency      plays a critical role in our Nation's government. Attorney      General Pruitt has proven over the course of his career that      he has the right character, experience, and knowledge to      serve as the Administrator of the We urge the Senate to      confirm his nomination.

Re Attorney General Scott Pruitt's Nomination To Serve as          Director of the Environmental Protection     John Barrasso,     Chairman, U.Senate Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Washington,     Tom Carper,     Ranking Member, U.Senate Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Dirksen Senate Office       Dear Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, and Members      of the U.Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: My      name is Dustin I am an attorney in Little Rock,      I served as the Democratic Attorney General of the      Stale of Arkansas from 2007-2015. During that time, I served      for three years as the Co-Chair of the Democratic Attorneys      General Association, I am a member of the Democratic National      Committee and was a strong supporter of Secretary Clinton's      campaign for I am grateful for your work on this      committee. I believe in the core mission of the Environmental      Protection I believe that climate change is real and      overwhelmingly the result of human activity. I believe that      the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in      shaping climate policy. These challenges in a hostile      political environment will be acutely felt by the next      director of the       As you consider the nomination of my friend Scott Pruitt, I      respectfully ask that you enter this letter into the record      so that I may attempt to clarify what I believe to be unfair      criticisms of the historic agreement negotiated between      myself on behalf of the State of Arkansas and Attorney      General Pruitt on behalf of the State of Oklahoma regarding      water quality in the Illinois River watershed.       Prior to the elections of General Pruitt or myself,      Oklahoma grappled with Arkansas municipal water systems and      Arkansas industry, primarily poultry companies, over      increased phosphorous levels in the Illinois River watershed.      Pollution was substantially impacting the water quality in      one of Oklahoma's most scenic waterways. In 2003, an      agreement was executed that would require that the phosphorus      levels be reduced over the next 10 years to a level .037      parts per million. As a result, all parties on both sides of      the state line worked diligently to substantially improve the      water quality.       At the same time, then-Oklahoma Attorney General Drew      Edmondson filed suit using an out of state plaintiffs' firm      against Arkansas's poultry industry. Many criticized the      litigation as taking the focus away from the environment and      placing it on money damages. The State of Oklahoma's outside      counsel presented their case to U.District Court Judge      Gregory Almost all the claims were dismissed by the      court. The evidence was fully submitted to the judge in March      of 2010 on the remaining question regarding injunctive      relief. To this day, no ruling in that litigation has been      handed down,       As 2013, the ten-year deadline for the reduced phosphorus      levels, was approaching, two things were evident: 1.) despite      huge improvements in water quality, the phosphorus levels in      the river would not be at .037 parts per million before the      deadline, and 2.) research into the standard itself called      into question its origin and basis in hard science.       The States of Arkansas and Oklahoma were facing a point of      litigating against one another (again) over this issue to the      detriment of all concerned, I approached General Pruitt to      ask if we could reach a solution that would protect the      environment and demonstrate to our citizens that we were      committed to working together on their behalf rather than      litigating against one another using taxpayer dollars for      lawyers instead of scientists.       The resulting agreement reflects that Oklahoma enhanced,      not relaxed, its enforcement of environmental protections.      Scientists were appointed to establish the proper water      quality metrics, establish a binding standard, and at no time      were phosphorous abatement measures relaxed. It was an      historic moment that demonstrated that cooperation in pursuit      of environmental protection yielded better results than      litigation. The resulting report was recently released from      the commission and is available for your review, (See,      www.ok.gov/conservation/documents/IR%20      2016.12.19%20Final%20Report.pdf)       Recent press accounts regarding these efforts unfairly      mischaracterize the work that was done by General Pruitt and      his team, He was a staunch defender of sound science and good      policy as appropriate tools to protect the environment of his      state. I saw firsthand how General Pruitt was able to bridge      political divides and manage multiple agency agendas to reach      an outcome that was heralded by most credible observers as      both positive and historic.       As I am sure that this committee will have questions about      this matter, I wanted to take this opportunity to add facts      and context to an accomplishment that should stand as a      credit to General Pruitt's career and qualifications for this      nomination.       I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to submit this      letter to you and to your committee and to be a part of the      record in these proceedings. I thank you for your service to      our nation,           Respectfully submitted,                                                  Dustin McDaniel.[[Page S1233]]                                       ____                                            Oklahoma Department of                                        Wildlife Conservation,                              Oklahoma City, OK, January 15, 2017.     Re Debunking New York Times article, ``Scott Pruitt, Trump's          E.P.Pick, Backed Industry Donors Over Regulators,''          January 14, 2017.     John Barrasso,     Chairman, U.Senate Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Washington,     Tom Carper,     Ranking Member, U.Senate Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Washington,       Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: Rarely do      I feel compelled to respond to a newspaper article,      particularly one that runs in a nationally renowned news      outlet like the New York I've learned over 23-years as      a State environmental regulator to value the media's role in      uncovering and exposing the truth, not to mention the wisdom      found in the quote, ``Never pick a fight with anyone who buys      ink by the barrel.'' However, the mistruths propagated by the      above captioned article undoubtedly caught the attention of      you, your fellow committee members, and many of your      respective constituents just days before Attorney General      Scott Pruitt's confirmation hearing for EPA Administrator,      and thus deserve a response from at least one of the      regulators that allegedly lost out to industry donors.       First, it's worth noting that I spoke with the New York      Times for nearly fifteen minutes laying out the facts from my      perspective as Oklahoma's former Secretary of Environment and      a plaintiff in the state's litigation against the poultry      industry, then later as Director of the Oklahoma Water      Resources Board--the agency responsible for establishing the      phosphorus standard referenced in the article. One would      think such experience deserves significant play in an article      of this focus, yet more column space was devoted to a retired      employee of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality      who was incorrectly listed as the leader of the agency's      Water Quality Division and wrongfully given credit for being      responsible for ``overseeing the poultry-related cleanup.''      The poultry industry and its related cleanup are governed by      our Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food &      Rather than insinuating that Mr.Derichsweiler retired out of      frustration with General Pruitt, instead of the fact that he      retired after 40 years of service to the State, the New York      Times should have at least divulged that Derichsweiler      currently serves as Vice Chair of the Oklahoma Chapter of      Sierra Club, an organization that has launched a campaign to      oppose General Pruitt's confirmation.       The facts that I shared in my interview with the New York      Times paint a completely different picture than the article      portrays. If I were writing the headline, it would read,      ``Pruitt Helps Deliver Water Quality Improvement in      Oklahoma's Scenic Rivers.'' At the end of the day, that has      been Oklahoma's goal in the Illinois River watershed for      decades, and that is what is happening during General      Pruitt's term as Attorney As I stated to the New      York Times, no State Attorney General can force a Federal      Judge to rule, or I'm certain former Attorney General Drew      Edmondson would have taken such action during his last two      years in office. Rather than beating his head against that      wall, Pruitt helped Oklahoma negotiate a new agreement with      the State of Arkansas that prompted not just a study of the      appropriate phosphorus level necessary to protect our shared      scenic rivers, which the article dismissed as trivial, but      more importantly provided for continued phosphorus controls      on wastewater and poultry facilities. For the first time in      my career, Oklahoma measured decreasing phosphorus levels and      water quality improvement in the Illinois River watershed      beginning in 2012. While many people on both sides of the      border deserve credit for this result, General Pruitt      definitely was a key player. This mere ``study'' ultimately      led to a recent agreement between the states of Arkansas and      Oklahoma wherein Arkansas committed to meet a more stringent      phosphorus standard--another shocking development for two      states that have quarreled for decades and quite the opposite      result one would expect from an Attorney General that is      being unfairly maligned as a shill for industry.       Rather than spend several more pages contesting the      inaccuracies found in the New York Times article, I will      leave you with this overarching truth. As a fifth generation      Oklahoman and someone that has devoted my career to natural      resource protection, I take great pride in the progress that      has been made in improving Oklahoma's land, air, water and      wildlife resources. For the past six years, General Pruitt      has been instrumental in many of our successes and has never      asked me to compromise regulatory efforts to benefit      industry. On the contrary, all of our projects and cases that      involved his office were given staff support at the highest      level and, more often than not, resulted in more stringent      environmental protections, Please do not confuse Pruitt as      being anti-environment because of his well justified (and      strongly supported by me) efforts to counter the EPA's      various attempts to second-guess or usurp State authority.      Rather, he has been a strong ally in defending our ability to      continue the great progress that we've made in protecting      Oklahoma's environment at the state level--progress that is      too often impeded by Federal overreach and interference.       If I can be of further assistance as you embark on your      important task of reviewing Mr.Pruitt's qualifications and      disposition to serve as EPA Administrator, please do not      hesitate to contact me. I've always found Mr.Pruitt to be a      man of great honesty and integrity, so you should have the      perfect opportunity in your hearing to gather facts before      making your final decision. If truth prevails, you will find      what most of us in Oklahoma know to be true: Scott Pruitt      stands for responsible, common sense, State-led environmental      protection efforts that generate positive results.           Respectfully,                                                      J.Strong,                                      ____                            [12, 2017]A Firsthand Perspective From a Man in the Middle: Pruitt Nomination is                                 Welcome                              (By Ed Fite)       We have all heard much yammering, left and right, about      President-elect Donald Trump having selected Oklahoma      Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the next head of the U.     Environmental Protection As a conservationist and      riverologist, I have worked firsthand with Scott Pruitt and      know a good deal more about him than those nationally that      are attempting to malign him.       I have made it my life's work and my career to look after      our states designated Scenic As a state employee and      a resource facilitator (I cannot take care of these valued-     treasured water resources by myself), I always find myself      arguing for the middle ground, for the workable solution upon      which both sides of an issue can agree. I have looked and      worked for real solutions, and have implemented them with      help from all sides.       I have found that General Pruitt has always done right by      our Scenic He has done every constructive thing that      he told me he would do. Furthermore, for the first time ever,      he has gotten the State of Arkansas, which happens to have      portions of the streams we've designated as ``scenic rivers''      originating in and flowing through their state, to agree to      Oklahoma's Scenic Rivers Phosphorus Standard--an incredible      environmental accomplishment, the impact of which cannot be      understated. Instead of engaging in years of inter-state      litigation, he did this by negotiating an agreement with      Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, a practical and      economical approach that will yield enormous environmental      benefits.       To understand the magnitude of this agreement, one must      consider that Oklahoma and Arkansas have litigated over      Illinois River water quality for more than three decades. The      latest action brought by Oklahoma, about abating water      quality degradation from the land-application of poultry      waste in the Illinois River watershed, has languished for      more than six years in the federal district court. Many      thought that when General Pruitt took office he would abandon      this suit because he is also known for his staunch support of      farming and ranching communities. However, not only did      General Pruitt allow the case to be fully litigated, he      proactively sought this joint state solution to let science      determine the phosphorus standard for the Illinois In      the end, a study conducted by Baylor University reinforced      that the phosphorus standard Oklahoma sought to protect would      remain.       Last, I have not seen him advocate dismantling the      Rather, he has rightfully supported necessary laws but has      challenged the agency when they have written new rules      without Congress having given them authority to do so. An      administrative agency should not decide what the law is in      the absence of legislation.       And so, my middle-of-the-river view is that Scott Pruitt is      one who is committed to finding a balance that protects and      preserves our environment while at the same time affords an      opportunity for a robust economy to exist. Achievement of one      doesn't have to be exclusive of the other.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1230.txt,1881,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February

We have seen it in agencies all across the government, including right now the Environmental Protection Agency, the Democrats are just wasting time, and they are doing it intentionally. They are not protecting our environment, not one bit. They are not safeguarding the health of the American people, not at all.

I want to set the record straight. As head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt will protect the environment. During his 6 years as attorney general for the State of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt has stood up to polluters, he has worked across State lines, and he has worked across party lines. He has done it to lower phosphorous levels in the Illinois He actually negotiated a water rights settlement with Oklahoma tribes. Why? Well, to preserve scenic lakes and rivers. He used commonsense policies.

These delays are all about obstruction. They are all about denying President Trump his That is what this is all about.

As the Cabinet nominees were named, what we saw was a list of eight nominees come out who Senator Schumer had as his hit list of nominees he was going to oppose, slow down, obstruct, boycott. Democrats delayed. They delayed again. They delayed again. That is what we saw in one after another.  When Scott Pruitt is confirmed today, he will take office later than any incoming EPA Administrator for any new administration going back to the 1980s.  Our friends on the other side of the aisle need to recognize that the terrible precedent they are setting today with all of these relentless and needless delays will continue into the future. It is a precedent, just like the precedent that Harry Reid set when he changed[[Page S1390]]the rules of the Senate by breaking the rules.

1419,topic-id,447,"Mr.Speaker, some would conclude that Black History Month comes to a close because we are at the end of February, but the Congressional Black Caucus wants the Nation to know that we are prepared to share our agenda all year long.  The Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor tonight to commemorate those brave men and women who came before us to fight for justice, equality, civil rights, and voting rights for all. These are men and women who shaped our Nation in the hope it would one day become a more perfect Union for all Americans, no matter their creed or color.                              {time}  2045  I want to thank our Congressional Black Caucus chairman, Congressman Cedric Richmond, and our Special Order Hour coanchors, Congresswoman Stacy Plaskett and Congressman Marc Veasey, my classmate, for hosting tonight's important discussion.  Mr.Speaker, you see, I grew up reading about soldiers of justice like Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Nat Turner, Crispus Attucks, and so many more.  Then, Mr.Speaker, I lived through the legacy of legends and civil rights leaders like Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King, Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, and Fannie Lou Hamer, all heroes and sheroes that allowed me to stand on their shoulders, to stand with them to continue to fight for justice and equality.  Today, we stand up during Black History Month, as 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, 49 strong, making our place in American history as African Americans, members like the iconic Assistant Leader James Clyburn, who you will hear from tonight; Congressman John Lewis; Chairman Cedric Richmond; Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who serves as the ranking member on the prestigious Financial Services Committee; Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, the 21st national president of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority; Senator Kamala Harris, the second Black woman to serve in the United States Senate; Congresswoman Robin Kelly, chairwoman of our healthcare brain trust; and so many more who serve in Congress, and who served as mayors of cities, mayors like Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, and so many more.  You see, Mr.Speaker, we are a part of that history. We are fighting. And so I tell you, I end with one of my favorite quotes by Martin Luther King, Jr.: ``The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, it is clear that we are in a challenging time with the new Trump administration, and so I say to you, we are fighting, we are uniting in a movement to fight for our democracy.

994,topic-id,3075,"Mr.President, last year was the hottest year on record, and 16 of the last 17 years have been the warmest years ever recorded. Climate change science is some of the most thoroughly established and well-tested research in history, and 97 percent of the published research says climate change is real and caused by humans.  Climate change is an urgent threat to our health, our national security, and our economy. How we address it is what we need to debate, not whether it is real.  As I have said before, I will work with anyone in this Chamber--Republican or Democrat--to address this issue. That is appropriate because survey after survey of people in Colorado--a State that is a third Democratic, a third Republican, and a third Independent--demonstrates that they believe the science, no matter which party they belong to.  In a very welcome sign, just last week, a group of statesmen, including former Secretary of State James Baker III, former Secretary of State George Shultz, and former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, Jr.,--all Republicans--released what they described as a ``conservative climate solution.''  These distinguished leaders have come together at just the right moment--at the perfect moment--because our new President says that he is ``not a big believer'' in climate change. In fact, he claimed during the campaign that climate change was a hoax invented by the Chinese to make U.manufacturing noncompetitive.  Consistent with that view, the President's nominee to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, recently said that the debate over climate change is quote ``far from settled.'' He wondered in December whether global warming is ``true or not,'' whether it is caused by humans and whether the Earth is cooling instead of heating. As attorney general of Oklahoma, he sought to prevent the very Agency he has been nominated to lead from fighting climate change, suing the EPA 14 times.  It is important, I guess, to note that while it is rare for somebody in America to share these views, Attorney General Pruitt is not alone in his extreme views in the new President's Rick Perry, the nominee to be Secretary of Energy, wrote in his book that climate science is ``all one contrived phony mess'' and that the Earth is actually ``experiencing a cooling trend.'' Ben Carson, the nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said: ``It is not clear if temperatures are going up or going down.'' Rex Tillerson, the new Secretary of State, said: ``None of the models agree on how climate change works.'' Mr.Trump's CIA Director, Mike Pompeo, said: ``There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change.''  When the Pope was talking about the importance of addressing climate change, which he said was a very real threat, there was an American politician who said that the Pope should stick to religion and that he wasn't a scientist. In fact, the Pope studied chemistry. I am glad he is using his voice on this important issue.  To be clear, some nominees seem to have undergone a confirmation process evolution on climate, but this seems more an effort to hide their extreme views in an effort to be confirmed rather than a genuine conversion based on facts or science, and that is a shame because the world cannot wait for this administration to stop ignoring the science.  Over the past 150 years, human activity has driven up greenhouse gas levels in our atmosphere higher and faster than at any time over the last 400,000 years. That is not surprising because we have pumped almost 400 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial As a result, carbon dioxide concentrations have risen from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history. That significant change over an insignificant period of time is dramatically changing the These emissions act like closed car windows: They allow light and heat in, but they don't allow most of the heat to ever escape.  Already, record heating has melted ice sheets as large as Texas, Georgia, and New York combined, adding billions of tons of water to our oceans every year. These rising seas have partially submerged cities in Florida and Georgia several times per year. They threaten 31 towns and cities in Alaska with imminent destruction. They are forcing a city in Louisiana to relocate its residents away from what is now an almost permanently flooded coast. By 2030, there won't be any glaciers left in Montana's Glacier National  While extreme events and natural disasters become more frequent, so do the effects climate change has on our daily lives. In my home State, 7 out of 10 Coloradans know that climate change is happening, and nearly half say they have personally experienced its effects. Shorter winters are already a threat to Colorado's $4.8 billion ski and snowboard industry and its 46,000 jobs.  Since the snow is melting sooner, there is not enough water for what are now longer summers. Colorado's farmers are forced to grow food with less water, a changing growing season, and higher temperatures. Our agriculture industry employs over 170,000 Coloradans and contributes more than $40 billion a year to our economy. These changes are not only threatening farmers' livelihoods, they are changing production and food prices at grocery stores.  Our beer industry is even weighing in. This week, I received a letter from 32 brewers from around the country, including three from Colorado, who oppose Scott Pruitt's nomination because they depend on America's clean water resources to brew their beer.  Hotter summers and the droughts they prolong cause wildfires that now burn twice as much land every year than they did 40 years ago. Together, State and Federal agencies are paying nearly $4 billion a year to fight those fires. Warmer waters and drought are hurting animals everywhere, like our cutthroat trout populations in That is not just a problem for the fish; in Colorado, rivers generate more than $9 billion in economic activity every year, including supporting nearly 80,000 jobs.  As warmer temperatures increase and spread across regions, so do incidents of vector-borne diseases like the West Nile virus and the hantavirus. And what do we do when we have longer, hotter summers? We crank up the air-conditioning, burning more fossil fuel and only perpetuating the problem.  I understand that sometimes it is hard to focus on climate change when the effects seem distant, but it should be impossible to ignore the immediate national security threat posed by climate change that is here today. Here in the Senate, in 2015, we passed a budget amendment with bipartisan support to promote ``national security by addressing human-induced climate change.'' That is what the amendment said. It got bipartisan support.  The former Secretary of Defense, the former Director of National Intelligence, and the former admiral in charge of U.Naval forces in the Pacific have all warned us that climate change is a threat to our national security.[[Page S1270]]  Around the world, climate change is increasing natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water, complicating American involvement and security. Climate change is linked to drought and crop loss and failure in southern Africa, leaving more than 6 million children malnourished by famine. It is increasing monsoons and heat waves in Pakistan, driving 11 million people out of their homes. It is even connected to water and food shortages that have intensified civil unrest from Egypt to  At home, climate change already has cost us billions to relocate and buffer military infrastructure from coastal erosion and protect military installations from energy outages. At the U.Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, VA, the largest naval installation in the world, sea levels have risen over 1 foot in the past 100 years. All the systems that support military readiness, from electrical utilities to housing at that base, are vulnerable to extreme flooding.  When the Department of Defense ``recognizes the reality of climate change''--those are their words--``and the significant risk it poses to U.interests globally,'' we should listen. When the Nation's most recent national security strategy says that ``climate change is an urgent and growing threat,'' we should act.  As a Senator from Colorado, I understand very well why people sometimes are frustrated when the EPA, for instance, does take action--or sometimes when it doesn't take action.  There are certainly some regulations that don't make sense, where a well-intentioned idea or an ill-intentioned idea--I think they are usually well-intentioned--from Washington ends up not making sense when it hits the ground. That is why I fought to revise EPA fuel storage tank regulations that hurt Colorado farmers, ranchers, and businesses in my home I supported an amendment making the Agency take a look at a new regulation that burdens families trying to remodel older homes. There are other regulations that I voted to get rid of. I supported, for instance, lifting the export ban on crude oil from the United States of America, a bill that we passed last year in connection with a 5-year extension of the tax credits for wind and solar energy, a great deal for the State of Colorado--both the lifting of the crude oil export ban and the extension of the tax credits for wind and solar.  I have also supported and fought for our coal community. In Colorado, working with my colleague Senator Gardner, I fought to keep a Colorado mine open to protect good-paying jobs in my I am proud to have a hard hat in my office bearing the signatures of the people who work at that mine.  I have to say tonight that the often-asserted claim that efforts to regulate carbon or more generally to protect our water and our air have significantly led to job losses in this country is false. This argument is a fraud perpetrated by politicians making promises that are broken from the start.  The reality--and it is important to understand the reality so we can remedy the situation--the reality is that free market forces and not mostly Federal regulation are transforming American electricity production.  American coal employment peaked in the early 1980s, long before we began seriously expanding natural energy. Natural gas has been gaining market share compared to coal since before 1990. Colorado, for example, has benefitted greatly from the natural gas boom. In almost every part of the United States, natural gas plants are now cheaper to build than coal plants. Facilities that were built when I became a Senator 8 years ago were built to import natural gas and are now being retrofitted to export natural gas to the rest of the world. That is good for our environment, and it is good for the geopolitical position of the United  Innovation is making renewable electricity more affordable for everybody. Between 2008 and 2015, the cost of wind power fell 41 percent. The cost of large-scale solar installations fell 64 percent. This has led to a 95-percent increase in solar deployment in 2016 over the previous year. The annual installation doubled in 1 year.  If we truly want to support our world communities, we should listen to Teddy Roosevelt, who once said that ``conservation and rural-life policies are really two sides of the same policy; and down at the bottom this policy rests upon the fundamental law that neither man nor nation can prosper unless, in dealing with the present, thought is steadily given to the future.''  The truth about the future is that there may be a lot of sound reasons to review, revisit, and even retire any number of Federal regulations, and I will bet there are, but cutting regulation will not reopen shuttered coal mines.  It is not about regulations or the EPA or about a War on Economic factors, market factors are driving the shift from coal to natural gas and renewables, and we need to recognize this shift and help coal communities adapt to a changing energy economy. They have contributed to building the economic vitality of this country. Their work helped us win World War We have to recognize the contribution; we can't just turn our backs. But we also need to acknowledge what is causing the changes that are occurring in our energy production because if we can't acknowledge the causes, we can't fix the problem; we can't make a meaningful difference for people in the communities that are affected by these changes; we can't fulfill what have become empty political promises instead of making real commitments on behalf of the American people.  We also have to take advantage of the changes in energy production to fuel economic growth and create new jobs. Already, renewable energy is creating jobs throughout the country. Energy efficiency employs 2.2 million Solar and wind companies employ more than 360,000 Americans, including more than 13,000 in my home State of Colorado now ranks first in the country in wind energy manufacturing. All together, clean energy employment grew 29 percent between 2009 and 2014 in  This isn't a Bolshevik plot, as I said on the floor before. These are American jobs. These are manufacturing jobs. These are plants where it is not just about the wind turbine but about all of the supply chain that goes along with it that can't be made in China and shipped to the United States and installed here. These jobs in this supply chain are American jobs. They are good jobs that pay a good wage, and they are meaningful to our economy. Last year, solar jobs grew 17 times faster than jobs in the rest of the national economy. They increased by 20 percent in Colorado in 1 year.  The expansion of natural gas, as I mentioned earlier, is also aiding our transition to a cleaner energy economy. Between 2005 and 2012, natural gas production grew by 35 percent in the United In Colorado, it expanded by 139 percent. Colorado now ranks sixth in the country in natural gas production as 10 of the Nation's 100 largest natural gasfields are now located in  These industries together create good-paying jobs that can't be exported overseas; and all of these changes, taken together, are beginning to address climate change. From 2008 to 2015, the American energy sector reduced its carbon emissions by 9.5 percent. We reduced our carbon emissions by almost 10 percent while the country's economy grew by more than 10 percent, and we are starting to see the same trend around the world. Global emissions stayed flat in 2015 while the global economy grew. Turning our backs on reality is not a recipe for job creation in this country, but embracing the reality is.  So I would ask this new President, after the campaign he ran and the promises he made, why he would promote policies that will kill American jobs and industries. Unfortunately--I regret to say this--even though 70 percent of Coloradoans say climate change is real and that humankind is contributing to it, the answer to my question about this administration's policies comes back to what it believes--to what it believes is a debate on climate change.  If we allow science to become debatable, we can contort our thinking to fit any fiction at all to support or undermine any public policy. We risk discarding facts we don't like and ignoring experts with whom we don't agree in favor of special interests, which[[Page S1271]]often dominate our political system. Our country needs more from us than that. Our national defense demands more than that from us.  When State Department analysts concluded with evidence, with science, that the Keystone Pipeline would not materially increase carbon emissions--facts lost in the phony debate here in Washington--I voted for it against intense opposition from my own party and many of my strongest supporters. That was a painful vote, one of the most painful I have ever taken and difficult to explain to many people I admire, but I was guided by the facts, not by politics, guided by the science, not by politics.  We have always drawn strength as a country from our belief in science, our confidence in reason and evidence. It is what Harry Truman called our ``unflinching passion for knowledge and truth.'' In school, we teach children to support theories with facts and look to science to explain the world. When it comes to climate change, we cannot allow the narrow limits of political expediency and special interests to cloud our sound judgment. That is not a lesson we should be teaching our children who need us to act on climate. That would set a horrible example for the people who are coming after us.  Our ultimate success in addressing climate change will rely on the same scientific method that sent us to the Moon and eradicated smallpox. If we surrender evidence to ideology, when it comes to climate change, we abandon the process of scientific inquiry. We leave ourselves completely unequipped to defend what we discover to be true. We loosen our grip on the science that allows us to understand that evolution is real and vaccines are effective; that something is true and something else is false. That, not doubt and denial, is the lesson we should leave our children; that we have the courage to confront this challenge without bias; that we have the wisdom to follow facts wherever they lead. That is what this Senate should do. That is what our country should do.  We have seen the evidence now. It is not theoretical anymore that we can grow our economy, the fact that we will grow our economy, that we can conserve energy while we do it, that we can create entirely new industries and technologies to power the most significant economy that human beings have ever seen in the history of the world, and that we can deal with climate at the same time. The two are linked.  Apparently, that is not what this President believes, and that is not what his nominee to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency believes. Because that is so far out of step with what Colorado believes and for all of the reasons I have talked about today and for the sake of our climate and for good-paying American jobs all over this country--but particularly in Colorado--I am compelled to vote no on the President's nominee to head the Environmental Protection  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Day in and day out, we have meaningful debate in committees and the House floor that reflect very real philosophical differences about the responsibilities and the limits of the Federal These differences and world views inevitably reflect differences in values.  Today, I can't understand how my Republican friends can defend values that allow and promote the cruelest possible killing methods.  Humans have hunted for millennia. This hunting traditionally requires patience, skill, cunning and encourage, but not sugar doughnuts, helicopters, gasses, or leg traps.  Today's House joint resolution would overturn this incredibly fair and reasonable U.Fish & Wildlife Service regulation that would rightly prohibit controversial and scientifically justified killing methods on 76 million acres of Federal wildlife refuge lands--76 million acres that belong to the American people.                              {time}  1245  The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act authorize--and, in fact, require--the Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain the natural diversity of refuges in Alaska, regardless of State wildlife laws. This includes protecting healthy populations of apex predators like wolves and bears.  So this rule would prohibit the inhumane and indiscriminate killing of keystone species in the national wildlife refuges. This does not interfere with fair chase hunting methods. It doesn't even prevent inhumane and indiscriminate killing on State and private lands.  Anyone voting to support this Congressional Review Act resolution today is tacitly supporting using airplanes and helicopters to scout land and shoot grizzly bears, killing wolves, black bears, coyote mothers and their pups and cubs in dens, actually gassing them, and the trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steel-jawed leg-hold traps and wire snares, where they are trapped, bleeding, frightened, slowly dying of thirst and starvation. Statewide polls show that Alaskans strongly support eliminating these cruel and unsporting practices.  Alaska also gains over $2 billion in economic activity for wildlife viewing, which is five times what it earns from hunting. This makes economic sense. It is a huge driver of tourism. Many come to Alaska for the unique opportunity to see bears, wolves, and other keystone species. They are the very ones at risk if we pass this resolution.

First off, ANILCA did not grant the State of Alaska any additional authority to manage wildlife on Federal lands. This rule is totally compliant with ANILCA actually prioritizes conservation of these species we are talking about here today, apex predators, on more than half the refuges in the  As required by ANILCA, the rule ensures that national wildlife refuges--that is what we are talking about here, wildlife refuges--conserve species and habitats in their natural diversity. That doesn't mean you kill the predators so that people who don't have good hunting skills are going to have an easier time getting a caribou or moose. That is not what this is supposed to be about on the national wildlife refuges. It actually prioritizes conservation of these species.  I just heard that something about this will severely restrict hunting and fishing on these lands. Absolutely not true, unless you say shooting wolves and their pups in the den or gassing them in the den is hunting--and we are restricting that.  Bears and cubs would be killed during hibernation, hunters crawling around killing bears during hibernation. No, hunters don't do that.  Brown and black bears would be trapped, snared using steel-jawed traps, wire snares--again, not hunters, not sportsmen.  Luring and baiting grizzly bears? Now, that is a real sportsmanlike hunter with a lot of skills kind of guy or woman who has to use bait to kill a grizzly bear.                              {time}  1300  Aerial gunning of bears by State agency personnel, that is hunters? No, not quite.  Sportsmen? No, don't think so.  And using aircraft to track bears and kill in the same day, those are the things that would be prohibited. That is what is prohibited.  Subsistence hunting? Absolutely no impact.  Fishing? Fish? I guess the fishing thing would be the grizzly bears eat the fish, and people who don't have good fishing skills want to catch the fish. So if we kill the grizzly bears, they won't eat the fish. So it does impact fishing, I guess, sort of, maybe. No, it doesn't.  This is absolutely inhumane, unsportsmanlike, and unnecessary. The State of Alaska is doing this just to decrease the natural balance of predation, which actually creates healthier herds of caribou and healthier moose populations.  There was a study done in 2015 by professors from both Alaska and Washington that showed that actually having these predators present increases the health and the diversity of the herds of caribou, because the sick and the lame and the old get killed, but the rest of them flourish and breed. There would be more than enough still to hunt.  Yeah, maybe you won't be able to drive your pickup truck, stick your rifle out of the away, blast away, and get one. You might actually have to get out of the pickup truck. You might actually have to have some hunting skills and track a little bit to get the caribou or the moose.  But if we kill off all of the grizzlies and the wolves, it will be a lot easier. They will overpopulate. Actually, what they will do is they will start going down at the riparian areas, like happened--it is a different ecosystem--in Yellowstone, and then the streams will not be as plentiful with fish.  This is about natural balance, it is about Federal lands, it is about sportsmen and women, and it is about prohibiting the State of Alaska from using its extreme predator control methods. That is what this is called: extreme predator control methods. That is all it prevents.

701,topic-id,726,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, one quick point is that these national wildlife refuges are U.public lands paid for by U.taxpayers and should be managed for the benefit of all. So let me quote former Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe, recently departed, who said these ``are not game farms managed for a slice of their diversity for the benefit of a few people who would call themselves hunters.''  Much has been made in this debate this afternoon, Madam Speaker, about whether ANILCA prohibits this Fish and Wildlife rule. We have gone back and forth with different cases. Let me just quote a few key paragraphs.  Section 302 and 303 of ANILCA establishes 16 national wildlife refuges, and for each one, the purpose is stated for which the refuge is to be established and shall be managed, including: ``to conserve fish and wildlife populations in their natural diversity.''  The law doesn't say wildlife should be managed in some alternate state of unnatural diversity where no wolves, no bears, and overpopulated moose herds can destroy the landscape.  Both the ANILCA, and the Improvement Act, the 1998 law that reorganized the National Wildlife Refuge System, managed Alaska's Federal refuge managers to conserve natural diversity, a value that the Fish and Wildlife Services correctly noted is incompatible with indiscriminate predator culls.  Every Federal court to consider the question, including the Ninth Circuit, which contains Alaska, has held the States lack the authority to overrule Fish and Wildlife Service management decisions concerning Federal refuge management. So this has already been before the courts. The courts, I believe, have already decided.  Madam Speaker, in the few minutes I have left, let me just quote a few of the letters we received from Alaska residents in opposition to the resolution before us.  Elizabeth Figus, from Juneau, writes: ``I am an I hunt and fish, and I support regulations that prohibit cruel killing. This rule would rightly prohibit controversial and scientifically unjustified killing methods on over 76 million acres of Federal lands in  ``A hunter who cannot comply with humane methods of the trade/sport is simply lazy and undeserving of the right to harvest the flesh of another living thing.  ``This is the 21st century, not the 1800s. We must carry out our hunting in a careful and organized fashion to ensure the safety of Alaskan residents as well as the sustainability of the wild animal resources into the future.''  This from Elisabeth Moorehead from Eagle River: ``My husband and I owned and operated a successful wildlife tourism business in Alaska for 27 years. The business still continues in the capable hands of one of our guides. . . . I am writing to convey my displeasure over the content of the joint resolution you recently introduced in response to U.Fish and Wildlife Service regulations that ban cruel and unsporting methods of killing bears, wolves and coyotes on Federal wildlife refuges in Alaska.''  And from Fran Mauer in Fairbanks: ``Over the last 15 years I have watched the state hunting regulations for wolves and bears get progressively more extreme. These methods go far beyond any common sense, are not supported by science, and have no place in our Alaskan National Wildlife This is the result of the special interest lobby of extreme pro-hunting groups. . . . I for one, and many other Alaskan hunters, do not want to see the State of Alaska turn our National Wildlife Refuges into game farms.''  And, finally, from Jeff Fair from Palmer: ``I write you as a 23-year Alaskan wildlife biologist . . . Currently 64 years of age, I hunt and fish and enjoy a permanent license to do so in The Great  ``As a biologist, I recognize that predator control does not work in the long run to stabilize or maximize cervid populations. I also recognize that an attempt to repeal U.Fish and Wildlife regs on these lands would be an attempt to circumvent, contradict, overturn, or simply break the Federal law that establishes the Fish and Wildlife Service's mission and authority for these lands. And as a hunter I fear for the reputation of the hunting tradition, including conservation and fair-chase, when some service anti-predator techniques are allowed anywhere, including on federal lands.''

702,topic-id,194,"Madam Speaker, just in mild response, I am, I believe, heartened to know--that may be the wrong verb--but, at least, respect my friend and colleague from Alaska's notion or assertion that these terrible, inhumane hunting practices, which we have talked about for the last hour--whether it is gassing wolves in the den or shooting bears from the helicopter or using bait for the bears or many of the iron leg traps--that all these things do not occur in Alaska on the wildlife refuges; that they are illegal in If that is so, that is an excellent thing.  I wonder why the need for the Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Fish and Wildlife regulations if none of these are, in fact, happening.  In any case, there is still a legitimate debate about whether the Fish and Wildlife regulation contravenes ANILCA and the state establishment act. Hopefully, this doesn't have to go to court in order to do that, but I think there seems to be enough judicial precedent that if it did go to court, the Fish and Wildlife regulations would be upheld.

1601,topic-id,389,"Madam Chair, my amendment today is meant to address only one of several troubling provisions in the bill.  As my colleagues have pointed out, the SCRUB Act is a radical approach to deregulation and would prioritize cost savings through repeal of rules without considering their public benefit. The underlying bill would also prohibit agencies from making any new rules--even in the case of an imminent threat to public health or safety--unless the cost is offset by repealing an existing rule.  We have heard often on this floor my Republican friends rail against regulations promulgated by faceless bureaucrats. Well, this bill seeks to accomplish all of this through the work of an unelected commission--faceless--with virtually unlimited subpoena authority and jurisdiction over every existing regulation.  This body would work in the shadows to roll back environmental and workplace protections, putting dollars and cents over public health. The legislation grants so much in the way of authority, but comes with so little in the way of oversight, transparency, or public accountability.  President Trump and my friends on the other side of the aisle like to talk a lot about draining the swamp. Madam Chair, what the Republicans are proposing today makes a swamp look like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, all at the cost of $30 million to the American taxpayer.  My amendment today would bring a modicum of transparency and ethical oversight to the shadow bureaucracy by requiring commission members to follow the same financial disclosure rules as Members of Congress, congressional staff, or any Federal official.  My amendment would also ensure that commission members don't come in through the ``revolving door'' by inserting a requirement that the individual must not have been a registered lobbyist at any point during the previous 2 years. Congress not only has the authority, but the duty to review existing regulations and, when necessary, to mandate reforms.  But I understand why Republicans want to delegate this work. Because who wants to be the one to recommend rolling back rules governing clean air, clean water, food safety, workplace protections, domestic violence, victim protections, and many other rules that are in place to keep Americans healthy and safe?  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment simply to give transparency, openness, and clarity to the people who will be making the decisions under the SCRUB  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1370.txt,2272,1415,2017.0,28.0,February

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my resolution of disapproval, H.43, which uses the authority of the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Obama administration's 11th-hour rule forcing States like Tennessee to fund abortion providers.  I want to begin today by stipulating very clearly what this resolution is about because, while I am unapologetically pro-life, you don't have to be in order to support this resolution. You just have to believe in the Tenth  Despite the histrionics you may hear on the other side of the aisle today, with today's resolution, we are not, we are not, one, voting to defund Planned Parenthood in any way, shape, or form; we are not voting to cut title X funding; and we are not voting to restrict abortion rights.  Madam Speaker, we are simply voting today to affirm the rights of States to fund the healthcare providers that best suit their needs, without fear of reprisal from their own Federal  I didn't realize this was a partisan issue. It shouldn't be, because that is how the title X grant program functioned for more than 45 years, until the Obama administration decided to leave this parting gift to abortion industry on its way out the door.  For me, this is a personal issue. As a registered nurse, I know that vulnerable women seeking true comprehensive care deserve better than abortion-centric facilities like Planned So, as a State legislator, I worked within my authority to make sure that Tennessee honored the will of[[Page H1269]]our pro-life populace and steered our State's share of title X dollars away from healthcare providers that performed abortion.  As a result, our share of title X grants have been sent exclusively to the Tennessee Department of Health, which then allocates them to the county health departments and other qualified providers that protect the lives of the most vulnerable. That was Tennessee's right, and it has been able to exercise that right while protecting access to comprehensive care for those who are most in need.  As a matter of fact, according to HHS' own 2015 title X Family Planning Annual Report, our State provided care under title X to more than 75,000 That means that we served even more citizens than the more populated States like Michigan and  But in December of last year, the Obama administration decided to intervene, setting unprecedented new parameters on how States must select title X grantees that were specifically designed to prop up its political allies in the abortion industry.

732,topic-id,384,"Madam Speaker, I must, once again, talk about what this resolution really does. This resolution empowers It empowers States that are able to choose to invest in women's health care over abortion by sending those title X dollars to clinics that do not destroy innocent life. My colleagues on the other side talked about how this is destructive to women's health. I want to just mention that the true destruction to women's health is abortion. That is the little girl who is aborted that will never know about being a woman.  This bill does nothing to prohibit States from deciding where to best use their dollars, but in States such as mine in Tennessee for the last 6 years, who have made that decision to send their dollars to facilities that they believe give the best women's health care, comprehensive health care, to over 75,000 women in our State, more than many States that surround us that have larger populations.  If this were prohibiting women from getting services, we wouldn't be so successful with providing services to more than 75,000 women in our We haven't seen a decrease in services. We have seen an increase in services. If you were to ask these women what they thought about services that they are getting in these other facilities such as Department of Health and federally qualified health centers, you would see they are very satisfied because they get comprehensive services that go beyond what places like Planned Parenthood can even provide for them. They do mammograms, they do procedures if there are cancer cells found in a woman's cervix.  So this whole ruse that this is a war on women and that we are taking away women's right to healthcare services is a ruse. All this does is to say, if a State like Tennessee decides this is the best place to give the best quality of care for a woman, and hopefully their babies and their children--which, if you go to these clinics, you will see them all running around, they have life--it just gives them the choice to do that.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington,     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell: Thank you      for your strong, principled and common-sense leadership on      the issue of preventing American tax dollars from funding      abortion on demand. Thank you also for your commitment to      providing healthcare access to the poor and other vulnerable      patients in need.       On behalf of the over 18,000 members of the Christian      Medical Association, we urge you to:       1. ensure the reallocation of funding currently used by      abortion-performing, partisan political organizations such as      Planned Parenthood, by directing that funding instead to the      over 13,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and      Rural Health Centers (RHCs); and,       2. overturn, through the Congressional Review Act, the US      Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule finalized      December 19, 2016, titled ``Compliance with Title X      Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting      Subrecipients,'' in order to ensure that states are allowed      to take a similar direction in allocating federal funding.       Many of our members serve in federally funded centers that      focus on providing care to patients regardless of who the      patient is or what the patient's values, orientation,      ethnicity or any other qualities may be. As you know well,      needy patients depend on these centers and on physicians like      our members to provide healthcare when likely no one else      would provide healthcare for them. FQHCs provide      comprehensive services and a ``medical home'' for whole      families and work in the areas of most critical need.       According to the independent government watchdog GAO in      2012, FQHCs served 21 million individuals and provided      services including STD testing, cancer screening and      contraceptive management, as well as other services including      immunizations and general child wellness exams. FQHCs and      RHCs often meet patient needs on modest budgets, and those      who serve in these centers often do so at great personal      financial sacrifice. Unlike Planned Parenthood, which follows      an aggressive business plan designed to maximize profits on      services such as abortion, these centers exist for the      purpose of serving the nation's most needy patients.       Yet some medical groups like the American Congress of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists, whose pro-abortion ideology      aligns with Planned Parenthood and whose members profit      personally from working with Planned Parenthood, decry      ``political interference in the patient-physician      relationship.'' This cry comes, oddly enough, while applying      pressure on politicians to fund political groups like Planned      It is also worth observing what sources such as      the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics and PolitiFact      National have confirmed--that Planned Parenthood spends      millions of dollars each year for one partisan purpose: to      elect Democrats and defeat       It's hard to get more political than that, and it's      impossible to get more politically partisan than that.       The majority of Americans do not want their tax dollars to      subsidize abortion, and they certainly do not want their tax      dollars to subsidize an abortion-performing partisan      political machine. Because of the strong concern of American      taxpayers, existing federal law addresses direct funding of      abortion. However, the fungible nature of federal grants to      Planned Parenthood means that every American's tax dollars,      regardless of their convictions about abortion, are being      used to prop up the abortion industry.       Any organization that wishes to avoid political      entanglement can do so quite easily--by simply foregoing      government funding. Those who seek funding should expect      federal and/or state oversight, requirements and standards.       Even the most modest of standards should disqualify from      federal funding organizations such as Planned Parenthood,      given the recent findings of the Select Investigative Panel      on Infant Lives, the list of 15 criminal and regulatory      referrals made by the Panel, and the referral by the Senate      Committee on the Judiciary to the FBI and the Department of      Justice for investigation and potential prosecution.       If any organization can and should do without federal      funding, the billion-dollar, corrupt abortion business      Planned Parenthood is a prime example.       We respectfully urge you to reallocate American tax dollars      away from such profit-centered, divisive and partisan      organizations and provide funding instead to patient-     centered, non-controversial and nonpartisan Federally      Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Centers      (RHCs).

Sincerely,                               David Stevens, MD, MA (Ethics) CEO.[[Page H1278]]                                       ____         United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Secretariat            of Pro-Life Activities,                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.       Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the U.     Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life      Activities to urge your support for H.Res 43. This      resolution of disapproval would nullify former President      Obama's final rule relating to compliance with Title X      requirements by project recipients. 81 91852 (     19, 2016). The stated purpose of this rule change is to      prevent states from excluding providers such as Planned      Parenthood from sub-awards based on state criteria, such as a      requirement that sub-recipients provide comprehensive primary      and preventive care in addition to family planning services.       The Title X rule change is bad public policy and should be      nullified for several reasons. First, it is deeply troubling      to many Americans that Planned Parenthood, the nation's      largest abortion network (performing over a third of all      abortions), receives more than half a billion taxpayer      dollars per year. This concern has rightly grown with      revelations about Planned Parenthood's willingness to traffic      in fetal tissue from abortions, and to alter abortion methods      not for any reason related to women's health but to obtain      more ``intact'' organs. Additionally, a recent revelation      that the vast majority of Planned Parenthood facilities do      not provide prenatal services provides additional evidence of      its bias toward providing and promoting abortion.       Second, the Department of Health and Human Service's stated      objective in preventing states from ensuring the seamless      delivery of comprehensive care places the Department in a      self-contradictory position. Last year in the Nation's      highest court, HHS touted the seamless coverage of health      services as a virtue. Indeed, the Department argued that      seamlessness is a government interest of the highest order,      sufficient to outweigh constitutionally and statutorily      protected religious objections.       In this new rule, however, HHS takes the opposite position,      saying that the seamless provision of services is an ill to      be avoided. The present rule would ensure that the provision      of care is fragmented, rather than seamless, because it would      undermine state requirements that sub-recipients provide      primary and preventive care in addition to family planning.      Seamlessness cannot at one and the same time be a government      interest of the highest order when it disadvantages religious      organizations, but an affirmative ill to be avoided when it      disadvantages Planned       Third, states may have other reasonable and persuasive      grounds for disqualifying entities from sub-awards that go      beyond the ability of such entities to ``provide Title X      services'' as the rule states (81 at 91860). For      example, a sub-award applicant may have been involved in      fraudulent practices, or the applicant or its stakeholders      may even have committed a crime, bearing on the applicant's      fitness and suitability for a sub-award. Indeed, the      requirements for federal awards and sub-awards in general are      typically accompanied by all sorts of standards, many of      which are imposed by the federal government itself, and those      standards often have little or nothing to do with the ability      to provide services (governmental guidelines are replete with      such requirements). States may also have widely differing      standards for sub-awardees based on the states' own policy      judgment. Therefore, it should be permissible for states to      decline to make a sub-award when the sub-awardee does not      meet applicable criteria, whether federal or state, even if      the entity is, strictly speaking, able to ``provide Title X      services.'' Those criteria, of course, themselves remain      subject to applicable federal and state law.       For each of these reasons, we urge you to support H.     43.

284,topic-id,477,"Mr.Speaker, I come to the floor this morning to talk about a piece of legislation that is going to be before us this week, and we are bringing it forward through the Congressional Review  In our office, we have had so many people ask: What is a Congressional Review Act, and how is it that you can recall these rules?  This allows Congress to exercise their authority over the agencies and the administration and the executive branch interaction where they make rules. Many times they do these rules, as this previous administration did, at the last minute, as they are heading out the door, trying to put their thumb and their imprint on actions and prohibit Congress or prohibit the States from taking an action.  So as we meet in this Chamber this week, we are going to take up H.43. H.43 is a resolution which will disapprove of one of these last-minute rule changes that President Obama made as he was exiting his office. This one deals with title X funds and the grant allocations that come through title X funds.  Now, title X funds were put in place to serve women and their healthcare needs, underserved women in underserved areas, and to make certain that there were provisions so that they could access women's health and have access to preventive screenings, to annual immunizations, those checkups that they need to have each year. Many times these funds have been used by individuals who will say: We do women's health and we also do abortion services.  Now, what the rule would have done was to block the States and to take away their ability to go in and ask: Who is going to have access to these funds, and are we going to disallow them to go to entities that provide abortion services?  So H.43 repeals the previous administration's rule and it restores and gives back to the States the flexibility that they want and desire to have to distribute these title X grants under the parameters for which this program was designed.  States should be able to offer family planning funds to providers that offer a full and complete range of healthcare services for women, but do not participate in elective abortions.  Title X funds, outside of the Affordable Care Act, were intended to help keep patients healthy and to help them on the road to a better quality of life and better health outcomes, not to take away life.  H.43 also redirects title X grant funds to other clinics comprised of local health departments, hospitals, and federally qualified health centers that seek to protect life and offer healthcare services to women.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.43, which repeals the previous administrative efforts which undermine State laws and restores to the States the title X grant program for its original purpose.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1189-2.txt,1748,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February

277,topic-id,693,"Mr.Speaker, like many people, I have noticed renewed interest in the 25th Amendment, as we have seen erratic behavior out of the White House, an inability of Donald Trump to even tell whether it rained on him during his inaugural speech, and repeating false statements that are demonstrably wrong.  Last Friday, the mechanism to deal with Presidential incapacity, the 25th Amendment, celebrated its 50th anniversary. I became intrigued with its history and application because it is clear, whether with Donald Trump or a future President, this mechanism is very important. Accidents can happen: President Reagan suffered from early onset Alzheimer's that concerned his staff. President Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke, and his wife, Edith, effectively governed the United States for months.  It is only a matter of time before we face these challenges again. As I examined the amendment, it became clear that, in the case of mental or emotional incapacity, there is a glaring flaw. For a mentally unstable, paranoid, or delusional President, the 25th Amendment has no guarantee of its application. In fact, it is likely that it would fail.  As written, the 25th Amendment requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to concur that the President is no longer capable of exercising authority. There are other safeguards. It would take time to process. Ultimately, two-thirds of both Houses of Congress must agree.  But look at the current Even if one thinks that a group with no meaningful government experience, all approved in a heightened partisan context, most of whom don't even know the President personally, could objectively exercise the power should the President become mentally incapacitated, the larger question is whether they would ever be allowed to do so.  A President who is paranoid or delusional is very unlikely to tolerate dissent within the ranks. He or she could simply fire any Cabinet member who would stand up to them.  That is why we need to exercise the other part of the 25th Amendment that allows Congress to designate another body, instead of the Who could exercise that authority with the confidence of the American public and with the knowledge of what it takes to understand the personal and political stresses of the Presidency?  I submit that the best failsafe to a President who is emotionally unstable would be to impanel our previous Presidents and Vice Presidents to make that determination.  Think about how it would work. Currently, there are 10 bipartisan former distinguished Americans who, in most cases, enjoy even greater public support than when they left office. Most importantly, there is no group of people better suited to evaluate the evidence and the dynamics at work for the good of the country and the President who needs help.  Now, we have made real progress with mental illness. We have made it easier to get care. We are taking away the stigma for the one in five Americans who suffer from mental health issues. We find people to be more open and candid and accepting of themselves and others. We are making real strides in terms of treatment and acceptance.  But all of this requires access to help; and this drama should not play out with somebody whose fingers are on the nuclear buttons and whose every pronouncement can unsettle diplomatic conditions, affect war and peace, and the global economy.  Having Congress establish this panel of former Presidents and Vice Presidents from both parties as a guardian and failsafe mechanism is important, and it needs to happen as soon as possible.  We never know when catastrophe might strike. There is no good time to fix this problem. In today's world of alternative facts and fake news, in a sea of bitter partisan controversy, we need to have a mechanism that can be reliable, command public confidence, and be above politics.  It is hard to think of a group that would collectively have more support and credibility than the distinguished[[Page H1188]]Americans who have been in that position and, regardless of partisan differences, whose allegiance to America is unquestioned.  We need to start now to protect the integrity of the most powerful position on the planet.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1187-4.txt,99,COMMITMENT TO CIVILITY,2017.0,15.0,February
373,topic-id,336,"Mr.Speaker, my friend, Mr.Roskam, said you can't make things up. Well, unfortunately, people are. First and foremost, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are conflating accounts that are in the name of individual savers who don't have pensions that would be set up under these proposals, with what has happened with State and local pension plans and, frankly, private pension plans that got over their skis, that overpromised, that added to things. These are just the accounts that belong to individuals.  Now, the hypocrisy strikes me that my Republican friends want to strip away the protections of the Affordable Care Act and turn it back to the Let them do with it what they will for Medicaid, for other local health programs. They think that is a great idea. But when governments on the State level like mine spent years developing a proposal that is innovative, that would protect people, that would involve no public tax dollars but at least engage people in a low-cost, transparent savings plan like we all have as Federal employees, then they don't want innovation, then they don't trust the States, then they want extra regulation that was never designed for programs like this.  I find it troubling that we would take a low-cost, high-impact program that has been developed in a number of States to help savers who have no program, that the private sector doesn't think they are important enough to invest in--or it is not worth their while--and strip that away. I think there is a reason why some business organizations, like the Chamber and other financial groups, are worried about this because this is a low-cost, high-impact, transparent program that will deliver benefits directly to employees. That is what more people should have.  I think they are afraid of the model and they are not willing to give the flexibility to the States in retirement that they are trying to do, throwing out the Affordable Care Act and having all sorts of innovation there.

700,topic-id,445,"Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and I appreciate his leadership on this.  I just heard my friend talk about these imaginary practices. If they are, in fact, imaginary, what is the problem in terms of having Fish and Wildlife moving to bring hunting standards in Federal lands in Alaska more in line with standards for other Federal lands across America?  The fact is that these practices can, in fact, occur, and it is the judgment of the professionals in this field that developed this proposal for the Fish and Wildlife These are the people who are charged with understanding the dynamics, who understand the interaction, based on sound science going forward. The majority of people in Alaska do not support such practices. These are basically the rules that the rest of America deals with in terms of our wildlife refuges.  I spent a lot of time working in the area of animal welfare. It is something that I find is one of those rare areas in Congress where there is far more agreement than disagreement. We find, across the country, 25,000 organizations that are dedicated to animal welfare. This is an area that I am sad to see we are breaking down now with, I think, unnecessary controversy.  Being able to deal with wildlife management and protection, being able to deal with humane hunting practices, to be able to allow the professionals in the Fish and Wildlife Service and elsewhere to be able to help in developing uniform standards is something that should not be unnecessarily divisive. I am hopeful that we give the Fish and Wildlife Service the authority and responsibility to manage these refuges and that we respect the fact that they took public input into account; they weighed the comments; they put forward a thoughtful rule.  Being able to nullify this rule entirely, return to some of the most inhumane practices, is simply inappropriate. Instead of rolling back these rules, we should respect the agency's expertise, the wishes of the vast majority of the people we represent, and uniform provisions to apply to all wildlife refuges.  I am really disappointed that the rhetoric reaches this level and that we are rushing ahead with making changes like this without providing the foundation that would normally occur in the legislative process. This rule is a culmination of a great deal of time and energy, public input, scientific expertise, and hard work. To overturn it summarily, as this Congress has been doing in other areas, I think is a step backwards. It is something that is not supported by the public, and I think it is something that we ought to strongly reject.

This represents, hopefully, the culmination of over 12 years' work. Congressman Walden and I spent a good deal of time with stakeholders back in Oregon focusing on what needed to be done to protect the treasure that is Hood and the surrounding wilderness area.  It culminated with a hike that we took around Hood--a 3-day camping trip with Congressman Walden, his[[Page H1332]]family, our staff, having a series of meetings with people who cared about the work. It was, for me, one of the most memorable experiences I have had as a Member of the House, both in terms of the delightful experience we had enjoying that wilderness area, but also being able to focus on things that were concrete, that would make a difference.  This is the remaining piece. In fact, it was 8 years ago in the first hours of the first Obama administration that the legislation that we worked on as part of the Wilderness Act was signed into law. And as has been referenced by our friend from California, we have been here before trying to complete this last piece.  The land exchange is necessary to be able to fully realize the benefits of the hard work of the stakeholders, to preserve the recreational benefits, to preserve the water, to be able to have a true win-win situation. All that remains is this little exchange.  I know my colleague is frustrated, as am I, that we have to be back here again with a piece of legislation. I am hopeful, as it was in the past, the House will approve, that our friends in the Senate will follow through, and that, somehow, this time it won't be a casualty in conference.

229,topic-id,1952,"Mr.President, I am here principally to speak about the NICS Social Security Act, Congressional Review Act resolution that is before our Chamber, but events of the last 24 hours really raise before us the urgent and unavoidable issue of needing an investigation into the recent activities of Michael He resigned as the National Security Advisor last night after revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials. He may have misled the President and others in the White House, but there are also very serious questions about who knew what when. These classic what did they know and when did they know it questions must be answered by an independent counsel or commission, and the reason it must be independent is the same very profoundly important reason that I gave to then-Nominee Jeff Sessions, now Attorney  The Attorney General must appoint a special counsel in cases where there is reason to question his complete impartiality and objectivity; the reality as well as the appearance mandate here that there be an independent investigation by a special counsel.  Only a special counsel, independent of the Attorney General and of the White House, can ask with penetrating, aggressive, unflinching analysis whether the President knew before Michael Flynn made those phone calls to the Russian Ambassador and other phone calls to other foreign powers what the subjects of the conversations were, even whether they were going to be made, and only an independent counsel can know, with complete credibility and being regarded that way by the public, as to what happened and who knew what happened and when they knew.  This issue is about more than just a phone call to the Russian It is about the integrity and honesty of public officials, about the protections we give to our intelligence, and about the independence of our justice system.  I certainly have respect for the Office of Attorney General, but Jeff Sessions was deeply involved in President Trump's campaign and in the Presidential transition. I expressed to him in the hearing on his nomination that he would have to distance himself from an investigation of exactly these issues to maintain impartiality and objectivity in that investigation. So I will write to him today, and the letter will be made public shortly, asking for an independent counsel, a special investigator who can produce the information that is necessary for the public to be assured that there has been an inquiry that is impartial, objective, comprehensive, and thorough. It has to be unflinching and unstinting, and it should be done as soon as possible.  Mr.President, I want to address the issue that is before us on the floor relating to the Congressional Review Act resolution that we will vote on shortly and in my view that will undermine existing law if it is passed. Too many times in recent years we have had the terrible responsibility of bearing witness to the trauma and grief that follow gun violence. We see it in our streets every day, not just in Sandy Hook, which every day weighs on our minds and thoughts and hearts in Connecticut but the more than 30,000 deaths every year and countless injures all across the country in big and small towns, the streets of Hartford as well as rural and suburban communities.  I am far from the only one in this Chamber who has borne witness to that trauma and grief. Gun violence has claimed too many lives in too many places, through mass shootings in movie theaters as well as the constant drumbeat of shootings that never make the headlines. Our constituents count on us to make them safe. That is one of the fundamental responsibilities of our government. And by overwhelming majorities, including majorities of Republicans and of gun owners, they support commonsense steps to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. In failing to move forward with legislation that would advance those goals, Congress has been complicit in this ongoing epidemic. It is truly a public health crisis. If more than 30,000 people died every year from disease or other kinds of communicable illnesses, there would be a call for drastic action.  This kind of public health crisis must be met with strong steps. When many of us in this body who believe that Congress must now take action to stem the scourge of gun violence hear one refrain from our colleagues--``enforce the law; enforce the law that already exists''--we must heed that cry.  Enforcing the law that already exists is exactly what this regulation entails. So we must be ready to move forward. Yet, as my friend and colleague Senator Murphy noted earlier, the Congressional Review Act resolution we are about to vote on will not only fail to enforce existing law, it will undermine existing law. Federal law prohibits those who have severe mental health issues--that is to say, issues that would prevent them from safely handling a gun, from possessing a gun.  Federal law also requires agencies that have information indicating that people are disqualified from gun possession to share that information with the NICS background check system. Under this regulation, the Social Security Administration has proposed to do[[Page S1151]]exactly that. Pursuant to the 2007 NICS Improvement Amendments Act--a law passed in the wake of the horrific Virginia Tech shooting to address significant loopholes in the background check system--the Social Security Administration will submit records to NICS for Social Security recipients who meet a specific set of carefully defined criteria. The regulation will apply only to a subset of Social Security disability recipients. It does not apply to those who are receiving Social Security retirement benefits. It applies only to those disability recipients who have been found, based on the Social Security Administration's established criteria, to be severely impaired due to a mental disability and who are therefore unable to perform substantial work or manage their own disability benefits.  Repealing this regulation could lead to great harm, exacerbating loopholes and failings in the background check system that erode public safety.  I have a letter from the United States Conference of Mayors, which represents city leaders from across our country. It says that ``due to loopholes in current law, too many mass murderers are still able to too easily obtain guns. This includes the individual responsible for killing 32 people and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 that led to the enactment of the NICS Improvement Amendments These killings must stop and this rule, as implemented last year, will help to do that.''

The rule implements existing law, which required the SSA to      send the names of those identified as prohibited people to      the National Instant Background Check System (NICS). This      rule finally brings SSA in compliance with the NICS      Improvement Amendments Act (NIAA), a law that Congress passed      on a bipartisan basis and President Bush signed into law in      2007. It also is consistent with ATF's direction for      complying with the law.       The rule has a limited scope but is critically important to      the fabric of our nation's background check system. Under the      rule, people who receive benefits from the Social Security      Administration due to a severe ``mental impairment'' and      require a fiduciary representative to manage their benefits      would be notified and reported to the FBI's The rule      affects anyone 18 and older who qualifies for disability      because of a primary designation of ``mental impairment''      that prevents the person from working and who must have a      ``representative payee'' for handling his or her finances.      This includes people who have been certified to be afflicted      with severe mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia      and other psychotic disorders, personality disorders,      intellectual disabilities, anxiety-related disorders,      substance addiction disorders and autistic disorders. These      individuals have the right to appeal and a clear process for      doing so.       We all know that it is due to loopholes in current law that      too many mass murderers are still able to too easily obtain      guns. This includes the individual responsible for killing 32      people and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 that      led to enactment of the These killings must stop and      this rule, as implemented last year, will help to do that.

The law requires SSA to send the      names of mentally ill people, who have been determined to be      a danger to themselves or others by a physician, to the gun      purchase background check system. It is troubling that Senate      is now considering S.14, which threatens to undermine      this reasonable, bipartisan legislation that is making      cities, and police officers, more safe.       The rule is limited in scope and critically important to      the fabric of our nation's background check system. Under the      rule, people who receive benefits from the Social Security      Administration due to a severe ``mental impairment'' and      require a fiduciary representative to manage their benefits      would be notified and reported to the FBI's The rule      affects anyone 18 and older who qualifies for disability      because of a primary designation of ``mental impairment''      that prevents the person from working and who must have a      ``representative payee'' for handling his or her finances.      This includes people who have been certified to be afflicted      with severe mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia      and other psychotic disorders, personality disorders,      intellectual disabilities, anxiety-related disorders,      substance addiction disorders and autistic disorders.       Loopholes in the NICS law have allowed people who are      clearly a danger to themselves or others to obtain guns. This      includes the individuals responsible for killing 32 people      and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007; killing six      people and injuring 13 others, including Congresswoman      Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson in 2011; killing 12 people and      injuring 70 others in Aurora in 2012; and killing 26 people,      including 20 children in Newtown in 2012. These killings must      stop and this rule, as implemented last year, will help to do      that.       We urge you to oppose S.14 or any other efforts to      undermine or otherwise compromise the national Brady      background check system that has stopped over 3 million      prohibited purchasers from acquiring guns since its      enactment.

230,topic-id,1032,"It is critical to note that neither I nor any proponents of the Social Security Administration's rule believe that all or most or even a significant percentage of those suffering from mental health issues are dangerous--far from it. The overwhelming majority of people who confront mental health issues are peaceful and law-abiding citizens who seek only the treatment that should be everybody's right. In fact, I have been a strong advocate over many years of mental health parity, beginning when I was attorney general in the State of The very first Federal law on this issue that was passed was modeled in many ways after the State law that I championed. I was proud to support the passage of a bill last year to provide more resources to those seeking treatment, and I hope that it moves this country toward providing everyone with the care they need.  Mental health issues should be no cause for fear, no reason for stigma, no excuse for shame. Those who have come forward and been open about the treatment they have sought, in fact, have done themselves and their communities and country a great service. If I thought SSA regulations unfairly targeted people with mental illness or that it advanced the perception that they are inherently dangerous, I would oppose it with every fiber of my being, but that is not the regulation we have here.  As Senator Durbin said this morning and my colleague Senator Murphy reiterated, this rule is not one loosely applied to anyone who has some trouble balancing a checkbook; it applies only to those disability recipients with a serious and debilitating mental health issue. That is estimated to be about 75,000 people nationwide out of approximately 10 million Americans who suffer from a serious mental illness. Everyone who suffers from mental illness should have a right to treatment, but not all should have a gun. It is very unlikely that people who meet these criteria will be able to safely handle a gun or to safely store it in their home and prevent its misuse by themselves or by others.  It is possible that SSA's initial determination will be wrong. That is why crucially--please understand--crucially the regulation also provides due process. In fact, these due process protections are necessary when a constitutional right is at stake. This right, the Second Amendment right, must be respected as the law of the land. The regulation entitles those who are affected[[Page S1152]]by it to advanced notice. When going through the process to appoint someone else to handle their benefits, they are told that they will forfeit their firearms right. They are given that notice, and they are given due process. If they believe this is inappropriate or unnecessary, the regulation gives them that process to appeal. It is one that allows SSA to grant relief upon a determination that the beneficiary will not be ``dangerous to public safety,'' a term that has meaning.  SSA is also required to notify the NICS background check system if the name should be removed, whether it was submitted in error or because a beneficiary has recovered from the condition or because they were granted relief through the appeals process. Those are rights with real remedies, with due process, with fairness.  If I thought this regulation failed to provide adequate process that every individual is due, regardless of how much I support its goal, I would oppose it with, again, every fiber of my being because it should be and it is the law of the land.  Of course there may be ways that this regulation, like any regulation, could be improved if the criteria could be better targeted or if the due process protections could be made stronger or if the administration could be made more efficient. We should not hesitate to make those improvements. I would welcome suggestions for enhancements, but the methods chosen by my colleagues to attack this regulation--the Congressional Review Act--prevent any and all of those improvements.  Severely limiting the time for debate denies us adequate consideration. Much worse, it is a blunt-force instrument that will prevent the Social Security Administration from issuing any ``substantially similar'' regulation in the future. So the passage of this resolution will prevent the SSA from complying with the legal requirement for submitting legal records for a background check in the future. It will hamstring this agency and prevent it from fulfilling its obligation to public safety--that is regardless of whether new information comes to light or whether it would be possible to devise a better method of submitting these records.  In the words of the well-known and respected group Americans for Responsible Solutions, using the CRA to undo this rule would ``not only allow guns to be placed into the hands of individuals determined to be legally incapable of using them safely, but it also creates an irresponsible, irreversible precedent.''  As I have always said, I will work with my colleagues on any good-faith steps to stem the tide of gun violence in this country, and I would be more than happy--in fact, I am eager--to work with them to fix flaws they see in this regulation. We need to come together to improve the integrity and efficiency of the national background check system and keep guns out of the hands of people who cannot safely handle them. People who are dangerous to themselves or others--it may be a very small number, but they can do great tragic damage. The resolution we will vote on shortly accomplishes neither of these goals. It does nothing to answer my constituents who ask me time and time again why Congress does nothing to confront the epidemic of gun violence in this country. It would create an irresponsible, irreversible precedent. More important than the precedent is the consequence in real lives of the death and injury that could result. Those deaths and injuries are truly irreversible and irresponsible, and we can help to stop them by taking the right stand on this resolution.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

556,topic-id,2319,"Mr.President, I am honored to follow my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island who has been such a champion for working people and economic progress in manufacturing and economic fairness so that our country as a whole can advance together.  I am proud to be a Senator who fights to preserve, protect, and strengthen the safety net for all Americans, as my colleague from Rhode Island does, and many of us here do. So I come to the floor to speak on Congressman Mick Mulvaney, with reluctance and sadness, because he is out of the mainstream and, really, an adversary of programs that assure that safety net and basic fairness that is at the core of our great democracy and our economic system.  I oppose his nomination to serve as Director of the Office of Management and Budget, hardly the best known of agencies and not necessarily the most glamorous or glitzy but among the most important. His position is among the most consequential because he serves as an economic adviser, as well as an allocator of funding throughout the Federal Government and a leader on important social programs.  He has proved strongly antithetical to those programs that have made America great: Medicare, Social Security, and other efforts, including the Affordable Care Act, which are essential to our future.  He has broad responsibilities for our Nation's budget. He also has important oversight responsibilities about Federal rulemaking--those unglamorous, sometimes invisible regulations and rules that affect real lives and livelihoods throughout this country. They establish rules of the road in industry. They establish access for people to Federal programs. They provide an essential means of achieving fairness in our democracy--that important process that agencies use to enact safeguards, for example, that keep our air and water clean and our workplaces safe.  Congressman Mulvaney's positions on these vital issues are out of step with American values, out of the mainstream of American popular opinion, and out of the area of acceptability in terms of basic public interest.  Our economic reality is characterized by one simple stark economic fact: Burdens are falling hardest on the people who can least afford them. I am not talking about people at the lowest rungs of income or wealth but middle-class Americans who work hard and who have seen their incomes stagnant over 5 years, 10 years, 20 years. Stagnating incomes and stagnating futures destroy the American dream.  So the Federal Reserve, for example, has reported in 2014 that average incomes have remained flat or fallen for all but the most affluent 10 percent of American families. That is a staggering fact about our economic system and its ability to deliver for Americans generally. That is the context for this nomination. I consistently hear from my constituents in Connecticut that income has failed to keep pace with overall economic recovery. Even as Wall Street has risen, Americans see nothing but stagnant income, sometimes falling economic prospects. Things have gotten better, but good jobs are still out of reach for far too many.  Retirement for increasing numbers of baby boomers makes it all the more vital that we protect and strengthen our safety net. The safety net is not the sole answer to larger challenges that must be solved by robust economic growth. That has to be our priority--economic growth in Connecticut and around the country. But increased opportunity depends on growth for ourselves and for our children--my wife and my four children and our way of life.  In fact, President Trump himself seemed to recognize this economic fact, one of the few areas where we agree, because he pledged during the campaign to keep our Nation's safety net firmly, irrevocably intact--not to make any cuts to Social Security or He pledged and promised.  Now, who is his nominee to be head of the OMB, that crucial agency with responsibility for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid? Mick Mulvaney has an affinity for draconian budget cuts and far-right positions that are completely out of step with this promise and pledge.  The President must have reversed himself or revoked his promise, because Congressman Mulvaney has spent his entire political career crusading against exactly these programs that keep millions of Americans out of poverty. Social Security is one of the great achievements of our American democracy. In fact, it is one of the greatest achievements the world has known because it has allowed this Nation to promise its people that they can avoid crushing poverty if they simply work hard and if they contribute to this program that is a form of insurance.  It is not a gift. It is not really an entitlement. It is an insurance program. It makes us a humane and decent nation. We care for people who have worked hard all of their lives and need to be protected so they need not depend on their children or their grandchildren.  Congressman Mulvaney has called Social Security a ``Ponzi scheme.'' Tell that to the Social Security recipients[[Page S1178]]in Tell that to the working people of He is out of step with working people and middle-class people who know that Social Security does not contribute to the Federal budget deficit, and it is not the Ponzi scheme that Congressman Mulvaney mischaracterizes it as being.  It is fashionable on the far right to use that characterization, suggesting it will run out of money unless severe restrictions are put in place. He has championed those kinds of restrictions--means testing, for example, and raising the retirement age. Those proposals are a disservice to hard-working Americans who reach that retirement age having been promised that they would receive Social Security when they did or work hard to make Social Security work for them, without a means test, without anybody asking them to fill out forms or disclose their incomes and establish standards or tests that make them ineligible.  It is true that there are changes to these programs that may be necessary. In fact, I proposed a plan for enhancing Social Security, making it a stronger insurance program by raising the cap on the payment of taxes that are due and other kinds of reforms that will more properly allocate the burdens but not means-testing, not raising the retirement age, which are radical and draconian favorites of the far right. Lifting the payroll tax cap so the wealthiest Americans contribute their fair share, as I have proposed, will keep this program solvent for decades into the future.  The only reason to reject the commonsense changes I have proposed is a political aversion to raising taxes on anyone at any time, even the wealthiest individuals or the most powerful and profitable companies, which is the mantra of people who have climbed the ladder and want to raise it so that no one else has access to those top rungs. It makes no sense to me that we would ask great sacrifices of our senior citizens but do nothing about eliminating the loopholes that privilege some of the most affluent people and the largest and most profitable companies in the world.  We should not and must not use the Social Security trust fund as a means to pay down the debt or reduce the deficit or gamble with the hard-earned benefits 61 million Americans rely on during their retirement. Those 61 million Americans, who come from all of the States and all over the Nation, are represented in this Chamber, and they deserve better than Mick Mulvaney's far-right radical ideas that would restrict their Social He fails to recognize this reality and would prevent Social Security from continuing to flourish and provide the stability so essential to this great Nation--already the greatest Nation in the history of the world because of programs like Social Security and  Speaking of Medicare, Congressman Mulvaney's proposal for Medicare also betrays the President's promise to leave Medicare intact. He has been vocal, absolutely frank about his support for tearing down Medicare, going as far as to say: ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' Do we really have to end Medicare as we know it, tear it down, destroy it? That is what Mick Mulvaney says. That betrays President Trump's promise to keep Medicare intact.  Mick Mulvaney has also supported proposals to privatize this lifesaving healthcare program by turning it into a voucher system, which would effectively gut its promise of guaranteed health benefits. A ``voucherized'' Medicare would be devastating for our Nation's seniors. Many of them are already on fixed incomes. This plan would allot them a fixed amount of funds--fixed funds to purchase all of their health insurance, which would result in higher premiums and increased out-of-pocket costs. Connecticut seniors deserve better than Mick Mulvaney's efforts to restrict Medicare in such a disruptive and destructive way.  Congressman Mulvaney's actions and statements on Medicare point to a future budget director who has no intention of keeping the President's promise to protect this crucial health program. This country counts on its next budget director to prioritize facts and responsibilities and the public interest above political games; to rely on real facts, not alternate facts.  Our budget, our deficit, our national debt are, in fact, fact-bound and fact-based. The world relies on real facts when it looks at the American economy, and the people who work in that economy, whether they are young or old, veterans or civilians, depend on real economic growth. Yet Congressman Mulvaney's reckless approach to fiscal issues has jeopardized this country's stability, causing real danger for the sake of ideology. That approach in the Congress has led to uncertainty and unpredictability, which are the bane of small- and medium-size businesses, which are, in turn, the major job creators in our society and economy.  Congressman Mulvaney's extreme views already have negatively impacted the American economy. While in the House of Representatives, he led efforts to leverage the threat of a government shutdown as a tactic to push for specific demands, which included radical anti-choice policies, measures antithetical to women's healthcare and the right of privacy, including defunding Planned  As one of the most senior economic advisers to the President and the head of OMB, he would have immense responsibility to influence this administration and the His outright disregard for the harm caused by a government shutdown--a tactic that jolts and jeopardizes our economy and disrupts the lives of millions of Americans--should itself alone disqualify him from this critical role within the Federal  He also sought government shutdowns as well to block the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has helped so many people in Connecticut receive the coverage and care they need. I could spend a lot of time talking about the benefits people in Connecticut have received from the Affordable Care Its future is key to the financial future of this country, but Mick Mulvaney has consistently advanced misconceptions and mistruths about the nature and functioning of this law.  Again, we can agree to disagree on policy, but misrepresenting the truth and relying on alternate facts is exactly what the budget director should not be doing. He is the one whom we rely on for real facts about our economy and our budget.  Even more worrying was Congressman Mulvaney's archaic approach to addressing the debt ceiling. In the face of all evidence, he flatly stated that he did not believe this country would default on its debt as a result of the failure to raise the debt ceiling. Economics 101: The debt ceiling, if it is not extended--that means a default.  Experts across the political spectrum agree that a breach of the debt ceiling, and consequently our Nation's full faith and credit, would be catastrophic. I am absolutely unable to vote for someone who fails to recognize that basic economic truth and takes this threat so lightly.  Finally, Congressman Mulvaney has demonstrated a near reflexive hostility to Federal agencies and the important work they do. As with so many of the President's nominees, unfortunately, he seems to be hostile to the very mission and purpose of the agency he is going to lead--whether it is the EPA or the Department of Labor or other agencies where nominees have taken stands that, in effect, say: Let's dismantle and destroy this agency. Yet they are the ones who are supposed to be leading and inspiring its efforts.  I believe that government could be more efficient and responsive. Waste ought to be eliminated. Fraud ought to be prosecuted. I am eager to work with my colleagues on good-faith proposals to achieve these goals.  Federal agencies remain vital to important public purposes that people cannot achieve on their own. They cannot clean our air and water on their own. They cannot ensure public safety through policing on their own. They cannot make sure our national defense is strong on their own. A whole myriad of functions depend on a functional Federal Commonsense rules that prohibit excessive pollution or unsafe working conditions protect all of us.  As the head of OMB, which includes offices that oversee Federal funding, he has a responsibility to make sure that rules are enforced and that people are protected. Yet he has opposed the existence of the Export-Import Bank, an[[Page S1179]]institution that is critically important to so many of our job creators, big and small businesses in Connecticut and around the country.  He opposed emergency funding for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, despite the devastation caused by this terrible storm, which was unleashed in Connecticut and nearby  He has questioned the need for government-funded research, despite the myriad advances in science and medicine that have come from government laboratories and research institutions.  His record shows that he would be the wrong person for this job, harming our safety net and our fiscal stability. I oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

990,topic-id,2169,"Mr.President, we are in a day--in fact, yet another day--of fast-developing, dramatic events. The news today that LTG Michael Flynn, who served until recently as National Security Advisor, may be culpable of lying to the FBI and therefore prosecutable for a Federal criminal violation adds urgency to the need for a special independent counsel to investigate all of the events surrounding his conversation with the Russian Ambassador and who knew what about it when and what was done.  The severity of this potential constitutional crisis--and we are careening toward a constitutional crisis--makes it all the more necessary that we have an objective and independent investigation, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions recuse himself, and the White House guarantee that documents are preserved--as we have requested in a letter sent by Members of the Judiciary Committee, including myself--today.  The severity of this potential constitutional crisis cannot be exaggerated. Still we are in the early days of a new administration but already the turmoil and turbulence throw into question almost all of the proceedings here on other issues, urgent and important issues--whether infrastructure, trade policy, job creation, economic growth, all of the pressing issues of our day. They also raise potential conflicts of interest on the part of other officials before us now, including the nomination of Scott News that we have also learned very recently, in this day of fast-developing events, increases the importance of deliberate and thoughtful consideration of this nomination.  Just within the last hour, a judge in Oklahoma has ordered the release of thousands of emails sent by this nominee, Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, relevant to his dealings with oil and gas interests in his State and elsewhere on relevant legislative and litigation issues. This development really requires a delay in this vote so we can review those emails and know what those conflicts of interest were, what they may continue to be, and whether his answers to our colleagues in his testimony at his confirmation hearing were completely accurate and truthful. We need to delve into those emails, know their contents, examine the contents, in fairness to him and in fairness to an administration that may be appointing for confirmation yet another official like General Flynn, who was forced to resign just days after his appointment.  The interests of the Trump administration, as well as this body, would be well served by delaying this vote so we can review those emails. I call upon the Republican leadership to delay this vote, give us a chance to review the emails, and give the American public a chance to understand how those emails reflect on the qualifications of Scott Pruitt and the potential conflicts of interest that may disqualify him from serving in this all-important role.  I am here to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt, but whether we oppose or approve of this nomination, we owe it to ourselves--I say to my colleagues--we owe it to the United States Senate to delay this vote so the potentially explosive material and contents of these emails can be fully considered. If we fail to delay, we are, in effect, potentially confirming a nominee who may be compelled to resign after his disqualifying conflicts of interest are exposed to public view. We have an obligation in advising and consenting to be as fully informed as possible. If there were no such emails, if there were no such court order, there might be an excuse for rushing to judgment as we are on track to do now. There is no excuse for a rush to confirmation. Our obligation to advise and consent implies also an obligation to review these emails as comprehensively and fully and fairly as possible before we make this decision.  The President has nominated Scott Pruitt as the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to serve a mission, which is to protect human health and safeguard the environment. Even before disclosure of these emails, which involve his contacts with oil and gas interests, he came before us as perhaps one of the least-qualified people in the United States of America to serve in this position. I don't make this statement lightly. It may sound like hyperbole or exaggeration, but the fact is, anyone who studies Scott Pruitt's record as attorney general of his State--and I served as attorney general of mine so I know his position pretty well--can see that his record is antithetical and hostile to the mission and purpose of this  He is a potential Administrator who will take office at a critical juncture for our planet. Sea levels continue to rise, long-established weather patterns[[Page S1263]]have begun shifting, and the average global temperature is rapidly approaching 2 centigrades Celsius above preindustrial levels. That is an increase which many climate scientists believe may be a point of no return--no return for the planet, no return for us, no return for generations to come. We are at a historic moment.  The question will be whether Scott Pruitt will be dedicated to doing something about climate change, about the pollution of our air, streams, rivers, and oceans, whether he will be committed to enforcing the rules and laws that protect us against those dangers of degradation of our environment--degradation of the air we breathe, the water we drink, the open spaces we enjoy.  That is the same Scott Pruitt who was pressed by our colleagues during his confirmation hearing and could not name a single regulation designed to protect clean air or water that he supports--the very same Scott Pruitt, who was asked by our colleague Jeff Merkley whether he agreed with the statement, ``Warming of the climate system is unequivocal,'' and he dodged and equivocated. When he was questioned about hundreds of thousands of dollars he has received in campaign contributions from energy companies, he basically refused to answer. He dodged the question. That is the Scott Pruitt who would become Administrator of the EPA, and it is the same Scott Pruitt who, as attorney general of Oklahoma, fought the tremendous progress made by the Obama administration at every turn, taking legal action against the EPA no fewer than 14 times.  While he was in office, he worked hand in hand with Oklahoma's largest energy companies to roll back regulations that are vital to the health and well-being of the American people, not just the people of Oklahoma, as bad as that would be, but of all Americans, all of our plant.  When he worked hand in hand with the Oklahoma energy industry, those common bonds of purpose and work would be well illuminated by these emails that today will be disclosed. In fact, maybe some of those conflicts of interest will be revealed and dramatized by those emails. That is why we must wait to have this confirmation vote.  He sued to try and block efforts to reduce nationwide emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas roughly 30 times more effective at trapping even carbon dioxide. He block the Clean Power He took three separate actions against the EPA's mercury and air toxic rule, targeting standards that the EPA estimates will save 45,000 lives. Those are three more actions, it should be noted, than he took to proactively promote clean air and clean water on behalf of the people of Oklahoma in his entire time in office. Why did he take those actions? Who helped him do it? How and why? The emails will help tell that story and answer those questions.  Taken alone, even without the emails, these actions hardly show a record of someone dedicated to promoting and protecting the environment. Not once during his confirmation process did Mr.Pruitt demonstrate to me a convincing willingness, let alone eagerness, to uphold the mission of the Agency he now hopes to run, nor has he shown an intent to be open and responsive with Members of this body. Most troubling of all, he has, in no uncertain terms, failed to give any indication that he will be a champion for our environment and that he will advance scientifically sound policies to protect the public's health.  The only thing Attorney General Pruitt has made abundantly clear is that he holds a derisively dismissive attitude toward the Agency he now seeks confirmation to lead. His nomination is an affront to the EPA, but even more, it is a threat to our health, a threat to our environment, a threat to the quality of our air and water, and a risky gamble on the world we will leave to our children and our grandchildren.  There is a very real concern about whose side Scott Pruitt will be on. The question is, Whose side will he be on when and if he is Administrator of the EPA? He has already shown a willingness to use the power of whatever office he holds to advance an extreme agenda and to malign opponents. Polluters do not need another champion in this administration, and our environment does not need another foe. We have enough foxes guarding henhouses as it is in this administration.  Mr.Pruitt's coziness with the firms that he will be required to regulate--again the emails will tell the story about his relationships with special interests. That is critically important, and, in fact, even on the record we have now, it should disqualify him from this position.  He doubts the effects of climate change and the extent to which our rapidly warming climate is as a result of human activity, calling this debate ``far from settled'' and placing himself well outside mainstream opinion. His denials are rooted in the promise of funds from corporations and interest groups that think it is far better for their bottom line to pretend that incontrovertible climate change simply doesn't exist.  He is a beneficiary of the denying corporations and special interests, and those contentions are not only regressive and fallacious but dangerous. If he is a prisoner of those special interests, as these emails may show him to be, my colleagues will regret voting for him--another reason that delaying his confirmation vote is appropriate and necessary now.  The scientific evidence of climate change and human involvement is overwhelming. You don't have to look hard to see it. Most of us in this Chamber would need to speak only with a handful of our constituents--the men and women who sent us here--to see the real impact this crisis is having.  My home State of Connecticut has experienced a major rise in storms that have cost hundreds of millions of dollars in damage as well as several lives. It seems that as soon as our State begins to rebuild from one storm, another wreaks havoc on many of the same devastated communities. These monster storms have become the new normal.  In Connecticut and around the country, weather disasters are rapidly becoming part of a way of life, tragically, for innocent people caught in their wake. In just 6 years, Connecticut has weathered the damage and destruction of a freak October snowstorm, Superstorm Sandy, and the force of numerous nor'easters. Severe storms like these, as well as other disasters--floods, tornadoes, droughts--are happening at a rate four times greater than just 30 years ago.  I am not here to argue climate change. I am here to argue that Scott Pruitt is unqualified to fight climate change because he denies it is a problem, and he denies the mission and purpose of the EPA as a vital purpose and mission of our Federal  The people of Connecticut understand climate change, and they get it. They understand that it is happening and that it is happening in their everyday lives. They see its effects. They know its causes, and they know the truth. It will get worse. We need to take action.  This body is on the verge of action that should be postponed so that we can consider vitally important information in those emails that reflects on conflicts of interest, ties to special interests, influence on Scott Pruitt, benefits to him in the past, and debts that he may owe, literally and figuratively, to those special interests that may impact his performance as Administrator of the  As attorney general of my State, environmental protection was a priority to me. I will be honest; I sued the Federal Government, just as Scott Pruitt did. I sued the Federal Government so that environmental protection would be made more rigorous and stringent and people would be protected, not to slow down the EPA but to speed it up to provide impetus for its action and, in fact, to compel it to carry out its mission and purpose.  Scott Pruitt has acted in exactly the opposite way, and the reasons for his antipathy and hostility to the EPA may well be illustrated even more dramatically and directly by these emails that we should consider.  I urge the Republican leadership to postpone and delay this vote so that we may, in fact, consider those emails.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

I have always been honored to call Alexion a Connecticut company, and I applaud the life-changing gains in medicine that it has made from the city of New Haven since 1992.  Even while maintaining a commitment to developing new therapies that impact the lives of patients with rare disorders throughout the world, Alexion has always remained committed to its community in Whether it is helping connect individuals who are homeless with temporary work assignments in New Haven, partnering with scientists at the University of Connecticut, or subsidizing public transportation to help students get to their classes at Gateway Community College, Alexion has proven time and time again that its commitment to the people of Connecticut and to its over 1,000 employees in the State is as strong as ever.  On its 25th anniversary, I applaud Alexion and the people who work so tirelessly for Alexion's values and commitment each and every day. Alexion continues changing lives through its medical breakthroughs, and I am so pleased to know that they call Connecticut home. Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1300.txt,2076,HONORING THE LIFE OF THE HONORABLE BOB MICHEL,2017.0,16.0,February
563,topic-id,1922,"Mr.President, every day we continue to set new records for how long it takes for the new President to get his Cabinet in power--in office--and the responsibility to carry out the things that the President said that he wanted to do when he was elected.  In the great history of confirming people, from the Garfield administration in the 1880s until Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, the entire Cabinet in that whole period of time was confirmed on the first day. Now we are in the longest period in the history of the country since George Washington was President to try to get a Cabinet in place, not to mention all of the other jobs that go along with confirming the It is a good thing and no wonder that a few years ago the Senate looked at the numbers of people we had taken responsibility to confirm and said: Now, which of those do we really have to confirm and which of those would we only confirm if someone in the Senate believes we have to have a hearing on that level of person and that agency at that time?  We tried to streamline a process that we all know needs to be streamlined, but with only a couple of exceptions, every nominee so far has been the most dangerous nominee of all time for whatever job it is. There must be fill-in-the-blank speeches back there somewhere that go from one to the next: This would be the worst person who could ever possibly hold this job.  In the case of Congressman Mulvaney, it appears to be because he wants to try to do things that allow our entitlement programs to survive; he wants to do things that allow the deficit at some point to be eliminated. And no matter what point that is, that point would be too early for some of our friends on the other side.  Interestingly, as we talk about the Affordable Care Act, which has turned out to be very unaffordable for almost any family on the individual market and many families who had insurance that worked for them before--the Affordable Care Act cut Medicare in the plan by $500 billion over 10 years. We hear speaker after speaker on the other side say: We would never do anything to cut I argued vigorously against those cuts when they occurred.  As we move forward, I think we ought to be very thoughtful that we restore the cuts in areas where clearly it is not working the way people thought the Affordable Care Act would work. The person in charge of the numbers, the person in charge of the balance sheet, the person who calculates the costs should be someone with the capacity to do that. The President has decided, and the Senate, when finally allowed to vote, will determine that person is Mr.                      Nomination of Scott Pruitt  Mr.President, the other thing we hope to do this week is to get to the EPA I have a hard time imagining that anybody had more future damage lined up for the economy than the past Administrator of the Rules like the clean power rule--all these rules almost always have a good name. Clean power, who wouldn't be for that? I am certainly for clean power, but the clean power rule, in virtually every State in the country, would have increased utility rates from the middle of the State of Pennsylvania to the western edge of at least Wyoming, if not beyond that.  Fifty percent of the power produced by coal-powered utility plants, most of which are cleaner than any utility plants that use coal have ever been or are anywhere in the world today, many of which are almost new, many of which aren't paid for--and, of course, who pays for that utility plant, whether you use it or not? It is the family who pays the utility bill. There is no mythical somebody else who will pay this bill. So if you shut down a plant sooner than you should, somebody has to pay for that.  You could write those same rules if your goal were to eliminate coal. That is a different debate. It is a debate we could have at another time. If your goal were to eliminate coal, you could write those same rules. If the rule simply said: When the utility plants you are using right now, which meet all the current standards, which are, in many cases, the cleanest coal-fired plants[[Page S1184]]that have ever been built or are being used anywhere in the world today--when that plant is paid for, here is what you have to do next. Then, when you get your utility bill, you are not paying for the plant you are not using and also paying for the plant you are using. This would be as if there were a new standard--this is the EPA view of this--on automobile mileage, and that standard came out and said: Here is what automobiles have to look like, in terms of standards, on miles per gallon, and, by the way, you have to have that car or that truck right now. If you have a truck or car that you are already driving that doesn't meet that standard, you can't drive it any longer. Of course, you still have to pay for it, but you can't drive it any longer. We have been doing mileage standards in this country that have made a significant difference for a long time, but we have never said: You have to stop driving the car you are driving, and you have to buy a new car. And, of course, you have to pay for the car you are driving or the bank is unlikely to give you the loan for a new car. But that is what the EPA said in the clean power rule.  There is a commonsense way to do things, and the next nominee we will be dealing with, Attorney General Pruitt, is a commonsense guy. He has had great responsibility as attorney general, but he has been willing to challenge these rules that didn't make sense.  On the clean power rule, by the way, Missouri is the fourth biggest user of coal-produced energy. Projections were that the average Missouri utility bill under that rule, if it had been allowed to go into effect--still in the courts because the courts say that EPA really doesn't have the authority to do that; at least the lower courts have all said that. If that had been allowed to go into effect, the average Missouri utility bill would have doubled in 10 or 12 years. It is not hard for a family to figure out. Get your utility bill out, look at it, multiply it by two, and see what happens to the things you were doing before you had to pay, in effect, a second utility bill.  It is time that these agencies had some common sense, whether they are agencies that are being evaluated by the Office of Management and Budget or agencies that are being tasked by the Congress and the President to do certain things. It is time they thought about families. It is time they thought about jobs.  If the economy of the country is better next year, the country will be stronger 25 years from now. I think we spend a lot of time thinking about what America should look like 25 years from now instead of what we can do so that families have better jobs next month and next year. It is time we got some common sense into trying to reach the goals we want to reach, rather than coming up with goals and then reaching them in a way that clearly will not work.  The waters of the United States--that is not a bad title. Water is important. Waters of the United States is important. The EPA talked about the waters of the United States and decided to take a definition that the Federal Government has used for well over 150 years. By the way, the EPA was given control of navigable waters in the Clean Water Act and decided that navigable waters aren't just what for 150 years the Federal Government said they were--from 1846 until just a couple of years ago, more than 150 years--which was something you could move a product on, which meant interstate commerce, which meant the Constitution gave that responsibility to the Federal government, but they said: That is actually any water that could run into any water that eventually could run into navigable waters. That is what the Clean Water Act said when it said the EPA could regulate navigable waters.  This is a Farm Bureau map that has been available for a long time but that the EPA never did challenge during this debate. Only the red part of our State would be covered by the EPA for anything involving water--things like a building permit or things like whether you can mow the right of way on the highway or things like whether farmers could use fertilizer in their field, even if it were 100 miles away from any navigable water. All of those things under the rule could have been under the authority of the Let me mention again, only the part of the map that is red would have been covered by the EPA, the part is that 99.7 percent of the map.  We have a lot of caves in our State and a few sinkholes. I think those white dots, the three-tenths of one percent, are some combination of caves and sinkholes where the water appears to run right back into the middle of the earth, instead of into any water. What a ridiculous rule. It is the kind of rule that the Office of Management and Budget should challenge whenever they are asked to look at the cost-benefit analysis. It is the kind of rule that a reasonable Administrator at the EPA would never let be issued. In fact, I would say it is the kind of rule that this Congress eventually, hopefully, will take this responsibility back and say: We have to vote on these rules. We have to take responsibility for things that cost families their extra income and cost people their jobs.  As we get along with the business of confirming Mick Mulvaney to the Office of Management and Budget--and then after that and before we leave this week--Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the EPA, hopefully both of them will use common sense as their guideline. Both of them will look at, What does this really mean to hard-working families? What does this mean to struggling families? What does this mean to single-mom families? What does this mean to young families who are trying to figure out how they can save for the future of their kids' college or even summer camp? A lot of things go away if you double the utility bill. A lot of things go away if it takes a year to get a building permit. A lot of things go away if we don't have common sense in our government.  I think this nominee, Mick Mulvaney, and the next nominee, Scott Pruitt, both bring that common sense to the jobs they have been asked to do and have agreed to do, if confirmed by the  I see my friend from Massachusetts is here.

354,topic-id,4429,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.66.  Working families in my home State of Oregon and across the country deserve the opportunity to retire with security and dignity. Unfortunately, that is not a reality for far too many Americans who face a growing retirement security crisis. In fact, nearly 40 million private sector workers, including an estimated 1 million in Oregon, do not have access to retirement savings plans at their jobs.  The AARP and others have noted that people who do not save for retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net programs that increase costs for taxpayers.  Mr.Speaker, Congress has not stepped up to address our country's retirement security crisis, so several States, including my home State of Oregon, have developed and implemented innovative solutions that will help workers save for retirement.  Oregon's program is set to launch in just 5 months. Workers who do not have access to a retirement plan through their employer will have access to a plan facilitated by the It is not mandatory--workers can opt out--and there is minimal paperwork for employees. Oregon's plan is portable, so workers can keep their retirement savings when they change jobs.  Consider Oregonian Penny Wicklander, who has worked hard but hasn't had access to a good retirement plan. Penny managed an apartment complex for low-income seniors, and she saw the hardships that residents faced without retirement security. Some lived on $10 in the last 10 days of the month. She said, in support of Oregon's plan:       No one wants to retire into poverty and rely on public      services, but it's hard to plan for the future when there are      so many other financial challenges facing our families. We      need a simple retirement account that makes it easy for      everyone to save part of what they earn, regardless of where      they work.  Bobbie Sotin, a home care worker who cares for seniors and people with disabilities doesn't have access to a retirement savings plan through her employer. Bobbie said:       Working with seniors in poverty, many care providers see      their own future every day. Once they reach retirement age,      they have to make the decision to live in poverty or keep      working until they die. Even if it[[Page H1207]]     means just $50 or $100 more per month, that kind of income      would make a huge difference to each and every one of us.  Penny, Bobbie, and people across the country need access to retirement savings plans. Oregon and several other States are working to fill that need. Congress should be supporting them and encouraging retirement savings programs like Oregon's and similar plans in California, Illinois, Connecticut, and Instead, House Republicans are advancing a Congressional Review Act joint resolution of disapproval that would endanger these plans, discourage other States from taking action, and undermine states' rights.  Specifically, this resolution would nullify an important Department of Labor rule that simply clarifies that these State-based savings plans do not run afoul of ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security The safe harbor rule went into effect last  Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle may characterize this as ``closing regulatory loopholes'' and they may question whether more government is the answer, but that is not what this is about.  The National Conference of State Legislatures and the State treasurers of Oregon, Illinois, and California submitted letters in opposition to this resolution. They found the ``DOL safe harbor provides flexibility to states, codifies clear protections for employers who facilitate retirement savings arrangements for their employees, and enables innovative solutions to addressing the growing retirement crisis facing this country.''  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record these letters and several other letters in opposition to this resolution.                                                February 10, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Speaker Ryan: Earlier this week, Tim Walberg and      Francis Rooney introduced two resolutions of disapproval      (H.Res 66, H.Res 67) to roll-back key Department of      Labor (US DOL) rules. These resolutions will limit our      abilities as states to provide solutions to the growing      retirement savings crisis, and could make it harder for small      businesses to participate in state-run programs.       We are writing to ask that you defend our state's rights by      voting ``No'' on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67.       The rule in question gives clarity for states across the      country to provide access to retirement savings options for      millions of private-sector workers. California, Illinois, and      Oregon are all in the process of implementing legislatively      approved state-administered plans that will enable nearly 8      million private-sector workers to save their own money for      retirement.       As Treasurers, we chair the respective Boards governing our      state plans and have been actively working with employers,      employees, payroll providers, and financial service      organizations for the last two years. The reality is, that      without access to an easy and affordable savings vehicle, far      too many workers risk retiring into poverty and becoming      overly reliant on Social Security or state and federal safety      net programs.       The final rule from US DOL provides key protections for      employers who facilitate enrollment for their employees--     confirming a safe harbor from ERISA and protecting businesses      from litigation or liability related to state programs--while      maintaining key consumer protections for program      participants.       While this rule has been finalized, opponents are seeking      to repeal or weaken the rule through the Congressional Review      We respectfully request that you oppose efforts to      repeal the rule and vote no on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67.      The US DOL safe harbor provides flexibility to states,      codifies clear protections for employers who facilitate      retirement savings arrangements for their employees, and      enables innovative solutions to addressing the growing      retirement crisis facing this country.       We are happy to provide additional information. Thank you      for your support.

Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of working Americans who      struggle to save for their retirement, AARP urges you to vote      against a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the      Department of Labor's final rule on ``Savings Arrangements      Established by States for Non-Governmental Employees''. AARP,      with its nearly 38 million members in all 50 States and the      District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.Virgin Islands,      is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that      helps people turn their goals and dreams into real      possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the      issues that matter most to families such as healthcare,      employment and income security, retirement planning,      affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.       Today, 55 million working Americans do not have a way to      save for retirement out of their regular paycheck. Despite      decades of federal incentives, employer sponsorship of      retirement savings plans has remained static. The lack of      employer-sponsored savings plans has a direct impact on the      retirement readiness of workers, because employees are 15      times more likely to save if they have access to a payroll      deduction savings plan at work.       In response to the stubborn lack of growth in employer-     sponsored retirement savings plans, numerous states have      removed regulatory and operational barriers for small      businesses who want to offer a retirement savings vehicle to      their workers. These bipartisan, commonsense solutions are      known as Secure Choice or Work and In the last two      years more than half the states considered a variety of      options to provide employers and their employees with low-     cost savings options, including Arizona, California,      Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana,      Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,      Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New      Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,      Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont,      Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and       In 2016, the Department of Labor promulgated a rule      providing states with guidance on how to enter into public-     private partnerships aimed at increasing personal savings      rates among small business employees. This rule makes it      clear that any automatic IRA program established by a state      must remove the operational burden of running a retirement      plan from small business owners. In fact, it asserts that a      small business owner's only interaction with a Work and Save      plan would be to facilitate payroll deductions for these      individual savings plans.       A Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn this      rulemaking will have a significant chilling effect on states,      sending the political message that state flexibility is not a      priority. There is successful precedent for states to take      action to promote personal financial responsibility. When      college savings plans, known as 529 plans, were created      twenty years ago, less than $2.5 billion had been saved for      college in these programs. Today, individuals have put away      more than $253.2 billion for college in 529 plans. Similarly,      in the retirement context, states are acting as facilitators,      aggregating small businesses to get the cost benefit of      pooling. All private financial firms can bid to invest the      savings from employees. The only employer role is to set up      the payroll deduction and forward materials to employees, a      role employers already perform for unemployment insurance,      workers' compensation, and other similar programs.       Often, states are the pioneers of solutions. State      governments more directly interact with both workers and      employers, and state policymakers are aware that growth in      the number of older Americans who do not have a secure      retirement will be felt most acutely in cities and states. As      laboratories of change, states are often more willing and      able to test creative solutions to improve the retirement      security needs of their workforce while respecting the unique      characteristics and demographics of each jurisdiction. The      lack of options to save for retirement at work is a      persistent problem that demands action today. States desire      flexibility to move forward with innovative reforms--Congress      should not curtail state efforts to promote retirement      savings. Americans need easy savings options. No one wants      older Americans solely dependent on Social Employer      plans are not growing and states are trying to meet the needs      of their citizens using private investment firms. Lack of      access to workplace savings plans is especially acute for      people of color--only 54 percent of African American and      Asian employees and 38 percent of Latino employees work for      an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, compared to 62      percent of White employees. Those who do not save enough for      retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net      programs, costing taxpayers down the line. In fact, states      taking action today could save taxpayers as much as $4.8      billion in the next ten years. Congress should support these      important state savings programs, not take steps to end them.       AARP urges Congress to support private retirement savings      and vote no on a Congressional Review Act resolution to      overturn the Department of Labor's rule on Savings      Arrangements Established by States for Non-Governmental      If you have further questions, please feel free to      contact me.

Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose H.     66 and H.67. These resolutions of disapproval      block Department of Labor (DoL) regulations that[[Page H1208]]     create safe harbors under which certain retirement savings      arrangements established by states or eligible political      subdivisions for private-sector workers will not be      considered ERISA-covered employee benefit plans.       While the vast majority of union members who work in the      private sector benefit from collectively bargained pensions      and retirement savings plans, over 38 million private-sector      workers are not offered any kind of plan at work. The DoL      regulations provide a path forward for states and      municipalities to create an easier way for these Americans to      begin building a retirement nest egg through payroll      deduction contributions into their own Individual Retirement      Account (IRA). A vote to rescind these regulations is a vote      to ensure that these Americans will remain financially      vulnerable in retirement.       Thank you for your consideration of our views.           Sincerely,                                                   William Samuel,     Director, Government Affairs                                  ____         American Federation of State, County and Municipal            Employees, AFL-CIO,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.     U.House of Representatives,     Washington, DC,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge you to oppose the      two Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval      blocking the U.Department of Labor (DOL) regulations for      state and city retirement savings programs, H.Res 66 and      H.Res 67.       Using the CRA to overturn these rules is an example of an      arbitrary process that upsets years of work by federal      agencies acting in strict adherence to the Administrative      Procedures Act to promulgate important federal rules and      actions. After thorough consideration that has involved the      public, state and local governments, and the Congress,      resolutions of disapproval should not be used for partisan      purposes to scrap agency rules at the last minute and to      subvert the regulatory process contrary to real needs of            We know there is a growing retirement security problem in      this country. It is estimated that 55 million full- and part-     time private sector workers in the U.lack access to      retirement coverage through work. This problem has grown      unabated and without adequate attention at the federal level.      Finally, new DOL rules that are under attack will enhance      retirement security for the millions of Americans who do not      have access to pensions and have limited means to increase      savings for retirement. The new rules simply allow states and      cities to set up important auto-enrollment programs to      enhance savings if they chose to do so. One rule encourages      state auto-enrollment tax-free savings plans, or state-     created tax-free saving plans for private business. The      second resolution would block a rule that clarifies when      county and city auto-enrollment plans will be exempt from      federal retirement law. California and a number of other      states have either already adopted plans or are considering      adopting plans. In addition, cities such as New York,      Philadelphia and Seattle are also considering similar      measures.       These resolutions of disapproval would unfairly impact      these new plans and the millions who want to take advantage      of them. Approximately half of all workers lack access to any      type of pension or employment-based retirement savings plan.      The DOL regulation is narrowly tailored to authorize      governments to establish plans for those employers who do not      offer retirement programs. The burden imposed upon such      employers is minimal. Significantly, the regulation simply      clarifies that states and local governments can create auto-     enrollment programs. In the absence of the regulation, states      may still offer the programs, although the legal status is      uncertain. These regulations not only clarify the matter, but      provide some important protections for participants.       I urge you to vote no on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67, which      would harm these important state and local savings programs.           Sincerely,                                                       Scott Frey,     Director of Federal Government                                  ____                                               American Federation                                                  of Teachers,                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: For many Americans, the ability to      maintain their living standards in retirement continues to be      a source of anxiety and concern. Two-thirds of participants      in the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 2016 Retirement      Confidence Survey indicated that they had no retirement plan,      and more than 50 percent reported they had less than $25,000      in retirement savings.       As a result, a large number of states are moving      legislation to help employees of small employers to access      retirement savings plans. The Department of Labor has      assisted this effort by excluding such plans from In      light of these facts, the AFT urges you to vote no on      Congressional Review Act resolutions (H.66 and H.     67) that would reimpose ERISA standards on governments      and only serve to chill state and city innovation.       Although most jobs are created by small businesses, most      small business workers are not offered any retirement plan.      According to the Center for Retirement Initiatives (CRI), 98      percent of all firms in the U.employ fewer than 100      workers, and about two-thirds of these workers lack access to      any retirement plan. Many small-business owners who were      contacted by the Government Accountability Office reported      shying away from sponsoring any retirement plan because of      all of the administrative requirements and fiduciary      responsibilities for selecting investment funds and managing      plan assets. Unless something is done to improve the      retirement prospects of the small-employer workforce, these      individuals will fall into poverty in retirement, and place      emotional stress on their families and financial stress on      their government sponsors.       In response to this retirement savings gap, a large number      of states have removed regulatory and administrative barriers      for small businesses that want to offer a retirement savings      vehicle to their workers. These bipartisan common-sense      approaches are collectively known as ``Secure Choice.'' In      the last few years, about half of all states have considered      ways to provide small employers and their employees with low-     cost, professionally managed savings options. Seven states      already have enacted legislation and are preparing to      implement their plans.       In 2016, the DOL promulgated an rule providing states and      cities with guidance on how to enter into public-private      partnerships, with the goal of increasing savings rates among      employees of small businesses. The rule clearly states that      an automatic IRA program established by a state or city must      remove the burden of administering the retirement plan from      small-business owners. The rule puts in place only one      requirement: Small employers that do not offer any other      retirement plan to their employees must offer a payroll      deduction for employees who voluntarily choose to participate      in the savings plan. In short, the DOL rule eliminates much      federal red tape, and gives governments more flexibility to      innovate. This allows states and cities to provide a glide      path for small employers to offer a retirement savings plan      to their workers.       Just as states facilitated the pooling and investing of 529      college savings plans in partnership with private investment      firms, the same convention is being employed in a retirement      savings context. Private investment companies can bid to      invest the pooled savings from employees of small employers.      Workers will enjoy the twin benefits of low-cost and well-     managed investments. Small employers are only required to      provide payroll deduction and forward the program information      to employees.       Again, the AFT urges Congress to support these state-     sponsored, public-private retirement savings programs--     collectively referred to as Secure Choice--by voting against      Congressional Review Act resolutions H.66 and H.     67.           Sincerely,                                                 Randi Weingarten,                                      ____                                               National Conference                                        of State Legislatures,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.       Members of The United States House of Representatives: The      National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), the bi-     partisan organization representing the legislatures of our      nation's states, territories, and commonwealths, urges you to      vote against H.66, a Congressional Review Act      resolution to overturn the Department of Labor's final rule      on ``Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-     Governmental Employees.''       As our nation's laboratories of democracy, states are      developing and implementing innovative solutions that will      improve the retirement security of private sector workforces      and that will also save taxpayers billions of dollars.      Passage of this resolution is an affront to those in Congress      who advocate for the 10th Amendment as it will result in an      unwarranted preemption of state innovation, will restrict the      ability of millions of hardworking Americans to save for      retirement, and will prove costly to federal and state      budgets.       As the number of workers who lack enough savings to cover      the costs of retirement expenses continues to grow, states      need the flexibility to develop creative solutions to this      problem. Restricting the ability of states to establish      private sector savings plans will put an even greater strain      on public finances because states and the federal government      are ultimately responsible for funding the social safety      programs that are utilized by retirees who are not      financially independent. Eight states have enacted laws that      will establish state-facilitated retirement plans' and many      other states are considering these plans for their state's      private sector workers. Passage of H.66 will likely      prevent states from establishing these innovative plans and      will result in increased costs for federal and state budgets      as tens of millions of Americans who depend solely on social      security will increase dependency on other entitlement      programs.       Finally, we challenge the argument that private sector      workers, who lack retirement options, should not depend on      their state governments to establish these retirement saving      programs. We ask members of Congress that if states did not      act to address this growing problem, who would? It was only      after years and years of failure by the private sector to      address the retirement of[[Page H1209]]     its small business workers that state governments were left      with no alternative but to provide an innovative solution for      these retirees' future. Congress should respect the states'      efforts to reduce a further financial burden on future      taxpayers.       NCSL urges Congress to support state innovation regarding      private retirement savings and vote no on a Congressional      Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor's      rule on ``Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-     Governmental Employees.''           Sincerely,     Senator Daniel Blue, Jr.,       North Carolina, President,     Senator Deb Peters,       South Dakota, President-Elect,                     Retirement Savings Fast Facts       Three-quarters of private sector workers feel anxious about      having enough money to live comfortably in retirement.       Fifty-five million Americans work for employers that do not      offer any form of a retirement savings plan.       80 percent of private sector workers between the ages of 18      and 64 support state-facilitated plans designed to help them      save their money for retirement.       State-facilitated retirement savings plans are designed      similarly to the popular 529 college savings plans, as the      plan's assets would be the personal property of the      individual saver, and their money could only be used to      benefit the individual saver.       State-facilitated retirement savings plans would be managed      by outside private sector fund managers and there will be no      connection between state-facilitated programs and public      pensions for government employees.       State-facilitated retirement savings plans would provide      employees the options to decline participation; however, data      suggests that employees with access to workplace retirement      plans are 15 times more likely to save for retirement.                                  ____                                  National Council of La Raza,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.     Virginia Foxx,     Chairman, House Committee on Education & Workforce,          Washington,     Bobby Scott,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Education & Workforce,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of      the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the nation's largest      Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, I write to ask      you to oppose Res 66 and Res 67, resolutions of      disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), to      block the Department of Labor (DOL) rules that allow states      and cities to implement their own Individual Retirement      Account (IRA) retirement plans.       In the absence of congressional action to increase access      to retirement plans, state plans have stepped up to innovate      and fill that gap. H.Res 66 and H.Res 67 impedes state      and local innovation and entrepreneurialism to solve the      retirement issue. If the DOL rules are abolished, it would      have a chilling effect on the states and cities that are      working to implement programs, including California,      Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, and Oregon, which have all      passed legislation to setup these programs and New York City,      Philadelphia and Seattle which are currently considering      their own auto IRA plans.       Tim Walberg's (R-MI) H.Res 66 and Francis      Rooney's (R-FL) H.Res 67 would nullify the DOL rules that      offered the clarification necessary to help states and cities      implement their own auto-IRA plans consistent with The      Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),      which would provide millions of workers access to a workplace      retirement plan. If these retirement plans were to become      subject to ERISA, they would not be able to move forward.       One of NCLR's goals in 2017 is to ensure the successful      implementation of the California Secure Choice Retirement      Savings In September 2016, California Governor Jerry      Brown signed into law a bill that allows workers to access      state-run IRAs, which will feature automatic enrollment for      people working for employers with five or more employees.      Just over 7.5 million Californian workers who do not      currently have an employer-sponsored plan--half of whom are      Latino--will benefit from this program.                  Latinos Have a Strong Desire To Save       NCLR has worked to improve opportunities for Hispanics in      the United States for nearly 50 years. One of our core areas      of work is economic security, which is contingent on an      individual's retirement readiness. While many Americans have      difficulty saving for retirement, the issue is even more      acute for communities of color. For example, 62% of Black and      69% of Hispanic households lack any assets in a retirement      account. For those who can save, their account balances are      disproportionately low: four in five Latino households aged      25-64 have less than $10,000 in retirement savings, compared      to one in two White households. Prior to the DOL rule,      limited access to traditional retirement savings products      severely affected Latino workers' ability to invest in their      future. Efforts, whether at the federal or state level, to      increase access to quality retirement savings plans are      crucial to enhance Latino retirement readiness.       The difficulty in saving for retirement is the result of a      variety of factors, including lack of availability of      employer-sponsored retirement plans and lower rates of      participation in those plans when they are offered. Workers      of color have less access to retirement savings vehicles      compared to Whites: 38% of Latino employees aged 25-64 work      for an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, compared to      62% of White employees. Of those workers who have access to      an employer-sponsored plan, not all participate: only 29.7%      of Latino workers who have an employer plan participate      compared to 53.8% of White workers.       Low wages make investing for retirement especially      challenging given that housing, health care, and education      costs continue to rise while wages remain stagnant. 42% of      all Latinos earn poverty-level wages, even with having the      highest rate of labor force participation among all racial      and ethnic groups. Despite earning low wages, numerous      studies have shown that Hispanics value saving. A 2014      national Prudential survey of Latino consumers found that      ``the `saver' mindset prevails'' with However, while      53% Latinos think that saving for retirement is a high      priority, near-term financial needs often compete for limited      resources.       Limited access to traditional retirement savings products      severely affect Latino worker's ability to invest in their      future. Efforts to increase access to quality retirement      savings plans are crucial to enhance Latino retirement      readiness. In the absence of congressional action to increase      access, state and city plans can help to fill that gap. It is      for the above reasons that NCLR urges you to opposes      Res 66 and Res 67 and ensure that millions of workers      have access to a workplace retirement plan.

Service Employees                                          International Union,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members      of the Service Employees International Union (SEID), I urge      you to vote against H.Res 66 and H.Res 67, resolutions      disapproving of the Department of Labor's rules relating to      retirement savings arrangements established by states and      qualified state political subdivisions. The Department of      Labor rules make it easier for small employers to offer their      workers access to programs for retirement savings and achieve      an essential component of the American dream.       There is a retirement savings crisis in our country. Fifty-     five million workers do not have access to a retirement      savings plan at work. As a result, nearly half of all workers      have no retirement assets--no pension, no 401(k), and no      States have stepped in to begin to address this crisis with      innovative legislation that gives workers the opportunity to      set aside their own money in low-fee, professionally managed      savings accounts. Importantly, private sector money managers      and administrators will be hired to run these programs on      behalf of the states, generating American jobs. The      Department of Labor issued rules that clarified that      employers would not be subject to the fiduciary      responsibilities and reporting requirements of the Employee      Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) under these state      initiatives.       In addition to helping workers achieve a dignified      retirement, the state initiatives provide small businesses      with easy, low-cost access to a retirement savings plan.      Small employers are the least likely to offer retirement      savings plans because the cost can be prohibitive and the      ERISA requirements can be onerous at the start. The state      initiatives also are fiscally prudent actions that will save      public spending. A new study by Segal Consulting estimated      that state Medicaid costs would be reduced by $5 billion      within the first ten years of implementation of the state      plans. Those savings would grow exponentially over time as      more workers retired with greater amounts of savings.       Five states--California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland      and Oregon--have enacted legislation and will soon begin      taking payroll contributions. About half of states have      studied or are studying this concept. Massachusetts and      Vermont are considering legislation that would also allow      employer contributions. Contrary to misinformation being      spread about these plans, the program funds are not      guaranteed by the state, and state and participating      employers will have no liability for the payment of      retirement funds earned by the participants. These state      plans are bipartisan public/private initiatives that      appropriately use states as laboratories for innovation. They      are a win for workers, for employers, and for governments at      all levels.       SEIU is also deeply concerned with efforts under the      Congressional Review Act (CRA) to circumvent the Executive      Branch process of rulemaking and issuing regulatory guidance.      Using the CRA authority to undo Agency regulations and      guidance crafted carefully and with public input strips away      the importance of the rulemaking process. Using this      authority could significantly weaken or undo past and future      rules that protect workers.       SEIU respectfully urges you to vote against resolutions      H.Res 66 and H.Res 67 disapproving of these important      rules. We may add votes on this legislation to our      legislative scorecard. If you have any questions please      contact John Gray, Legislative           Sincerely,                                                   Mary Kay Henry,     International                                  ____                                      Small Business Majority,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.     Re House Joint Resolutions 66 and 67.     Kevin McCarthy,     Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McCarthy: As a leading representative      of the 28 million small businesses in America, Small Business      Majority writes today urging you to oppose HJR 66 and HJR 67,      which would overturn the U.Department of Labor's rule      enabling states to establish retirement savings plans for      private sector workers. Striking down this rule would have a      chilling effect on states that are setting up their own      retirement savings programs, which would be harmful to small      businesses and their employees. We strongly believe states      should be allowed to decide whether to implement these types      of programs and how best to administer them in order to serve      small businesses and employees who struggle to save for      retirement.       The U.currently suffers from a retirement savings gap of      more than $6 trillion, and more than three million households      do not have any retirement savings at all. This lack of      savings for retirement disproportionately affects those who      are employed by small businesses. Eighty percent of workers      employed by businesses with fewer than 25 employees do not      have any sort of pension or retirement plan at all. This is      important because small businesses employ about half of all      private sector workers. Unless small business owners and      their employees start doing more to prepare for the future,      many Americans will not have enough money for their golden      years.       Small Business Majority's state opinion polling found small      business owners struggle to offer retirement savings programs      due to a number of barriers, but they want to offer this      benefit to their employees because it helps them attract and      retain talent. What's more, the majority of small employers      are concerned their employees will not have enough saved for      retirement. That's why small businesses overwhelmingly      support state efforts to establish state-administered      retirement savings programs, like the Secure Choice Savings      programs in Illinois and       When implemented, these programs will offer a convenient      and affordable option for small businesses and their      employees to save for the future. What's more, these programs      will not be funded by taxpayer dollars, and employers will      not contribute to funds, manage funds or have any      responsibility for financial advice for their employees'      investments.[[Page H1214]]       Business owners know offering benefits like retirement      savings create a happier and more productive staff, which in      turn leads to increased productivity. Many small business      owners think of their employees as family, so it's not      surprising they support programs that enable them to foster a      happier workforce while protecting their workers and their      bottom line.       Additionally, programs like these help level the playing      field between small businesses that want to offer retirement      benefits but can't, and their larger counterparts that can.      This helps small businesses compete for the best employees,      and gives employers peace of mind that they are doing what's      best for their workers.       Small employers need retirement savings options for their      employees that make sense for their business and their bottom      line. State-administered retirement savings programs, like      those currently being established in California and Illinois,      can help many small business employees better save for their      futures. We urge you to uphold the Labor Department's rule      and allow states to decide how best to serve their small      businesses and private sector workers.           Sincerely,     John                                  ____                                       Tuesday, February 14, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Speaker Ryan: Nearly 55 million workers across the country      lack access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, and      millions more fail to take full advantage of employer-     supported plans. Without access to easy and affordable      retirement savings options, far too many workers are on track      to retire into poverty where they will depend on Social      Security, state, and federal benefit programs for their most      basic retirement needs. States across the country have been      innovating to address this problem. We are writing to      respectfully urge you to protect the rights of states and      large municipalities to implement their own, unique      approaches.       Last week, two resolutions of disapproval (H.Res 66,      H.Res 67) were introduced to repeal key Department of      Labor (US DOL) rules. If passed, these resolutions would make      it more difficult for states and municipalities to seek      solutions to the growing retirement savings crisis. We ask      that you support the role of states as policy innovators by      voting ``No'' on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67.       Thirty states and municipalities are in the process of      implementing or exploring the establishment of state-     facilitated, private-sector retirement programs. Eight states      have passed legislation to allow individuals to save their      own earnings for retirement (no employer funds are involved      as these are not defined benefit plans). While most state and      municipal plans will be governed by independent boards, the      day-to-day investment management and recordkeeping would not      be conducted by the state, but rather by private sector      firms--the same financial institutions that currently provide      retirement savings products. These programs would apply to      businesses that don't currently offer a retirement plan, and      would in no way limit an employer's ability to seek out and      offer their own employer-sponsored plan.       Many states and municipalities are planning to use      Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) that will be wholly      owned and controlled by the participant, while others are      pursuing options such as Voluntary Multiple Employer Plans      (MEPs) and marketplace concepts. These plans would follow all      relevant guidelines and other noted regulations, and current      consumer protections would apply. Many of these programs are      modeled off of the 529 College Savings Plans or supplemental      public retirement plans that states administer today.       States are pursuing a multitude of solutions to address      this growing retirement savings crisis. We request that you      vote ``No'' on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67 with the      understanding that the US DOL rule provides important      flexibility to states and large municipalities as they seek      to address the growing retirement crisis facing this country.      We insist that states be allowed to maintain their      constitutional rights to implement such legislation.       We are happy to provide additional information or answer      any questions.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,       Speaker Ryan, Nearly 55 million workers across the country      lack access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, and      millions more fail to take full advantage of employer-     supported plans. Without access to easy and affordable      retirement savings options, far too many workers are on track      to retire into poverty where they will depend on Social      Security, state, and federal benefit programs for their most      basic retirement needs. States across the country have been      innovating to address this problem. We are writing to      respectfully urge you to protect the rights of states and      large municipalities to implement their own, unique      approaches.       Last week, two resolutions of disapproval (H.Res 66,      H.Res 67) were introduced to repeal key Department of      Labor (US DOL) rules. If passed, these resolutions would make      it more difficult for states and municipalities to seek      solutions to the growing retirement savings crisis. We ask      that you support the role of states as policy innovators by      voting ``No'' on H.Res 66 and H.Res 67.       Thirty states and municipalities are in the process of      implementing or exploring the establishment of state-     facilitated, private-sector retirement programs.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: We are writing to strongly oppose      H.J.Res 66, which overturns the recent Department of Labor      rule supporting states' efforts to establish retirement      savings plans for non-governmental workers. As a national,      non-partisan Millennial research and advocacy organization,      we have been working hard to strengthen the financial      security of young adults by increasing access to retirement      savings plans. This legislation may have a chilling effect on      the implementation of Secure Choice, an important new program      that will help address the looming retirement crisis without      costing taxpayers a dime.       Changing dynamics in the workforce mean that Millennials      tend to work in industries that offer lower wages and fewer      benefits. Despite an interest in saving the small amounts of      discretionary income they do have, many young adults do not      have access to workplace retirement savings plans, including      less than half of low-income Millennial workers. Young adults      are significantly less financially secure today than their      parents were just one generation ago: 25-34 year-old      Millennials have half the net wealth and earn 20 percent      lower incomes when compared to 25-34 year-old Baby      Limiting access to tools for saving makes catching up      financially that much more challenging for this generation.       Many states have worked diligently for over four years to      develop Secure Choice, which will provide workers who do not      have access to a workplace retirement plan a simple,      voluntary, low-cost, and portable retirement plan. Experts      agree that direct contributions from a paycheck into a      retirement account is the simplest and most effective way for      individuals to save.       This is why support among Millennials for a state      facilitated retirement savings plan like Secure Choice is      extraordinarily high: over 85 percent of young adults across      political affiliation and ideology support ``a voluntary      option for workers without a way to save for retirement at      work.''[[Page H1215]]       We urge you to oppose H.J.Res 66 and allow individual      states to develop the tools young Americans need to save for      retirement.           Sincerely,     Young                                  ____                                             State of Connecticut,                              Office of the State Comptroller,                                  Hartford, CT, February 14, 2017.     Joe Courtney:     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington,       Dear Representative Courtney: I am writing to seek your      support in preserving and strengthening the rights of      Connecticut and other states to address a growing retirement      savings crisis that threatens our state and national economy.       I am proud that Connecticut is among the states leading the      way for retirement security. The Connecticut Retirement      Security Authority savings program will ensure that      retirement savings opportunities are more readily attainable      for the 600,000 private-sector workers who lack access to a      retirement savings plan through the workplace and who deserve      financial security after a lifetime of work.       According to Connecticut-specific data from the Schwartz      Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School,      between 2000 and 2010, employers offering a retirement plan      declined from 66 percent to 59 percent. In other words, four      out of 10 workers residing in Connecticut do not have access      to a retirement plan at work.       In Connecticut's market analysis conducted by Boston      College, we found that these uncovered workers were more      likely to earn lower income and are largely unserved by the      financial sector, so their needs are often different from      other 401(k) participants. It is important to protect against      a transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top because high      fees on low dollar accounts are a huge obstacle to retirement      savings, particularly for lower income workers.       There is an entire generation of employees, many of them      lifelong hard-working middle class people, who are headed to      retirement financially unequipped, in part due to lack of      access to a workplace-based retirement savings option. This      is a problem, not only for those individuals and families who      are financially forced to delay retirement indefinitely, but      for our entire state and economy. In many cases, these      individuals may be forced to turn to the state for assistance      with health care, nursing care, food, housing, energy or      other costly services.       The goal is not to compete or replace the private market,      but to fulfill a significant unmet need in the market that      must be answered for the sake of those families and our      entire state economy. The market is currently failing to      reach nearly half of our workforce even though the demand is      there According to an AARP 2015 survey, 64% of small      businesses in Connecticut that were not offering a retirement      plan stated that they would take advantage of a state plan if      it were offered.       Connecticut was heartened by the U.Department of Labor      rule last August, providing a safe harbor for states to      conduct these programs. While we have been advised by several      ERISA attorneys that the U.Department of Labor rule was      not required, and that states already have the right to      establish such programs, the proposed bills nullifying the      U.Department of Labor rule and attempting to roll back      states' rights may create a chilling effect on the companies      who would want to administer these programs. I strongly urge      you to vote against H.J.Res.66 and support states' rights to      create these programs.           Sincerely,                                                      Kevin Lembo,                                                State  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1206.txt,2092,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February

I urge all my colleagues today to stand up for workers who deserve that chance at saving for retirement and who will get that chance because Oregon and other States have stepped up and are taking action.  Again, the Department of Labor safe harbor rule applies to States that have strict investor protections. We wouldn't be here today if those strict investor protections were not maintained.  I especially urge my colleagues, particularly those of us who are concerned about states' rights, not to undermine States like Oregon and all the others that have stepped up to create these innovative solutions.

399,topic-id,513,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong opposition to H.67, which would nullify the Department of Labor rule enabling certain State political subdivisions, such as cities or counties, to establish payroll deduction retirement savings plans.  Working families across the country deserve the opportunity to retire with security and dignity. That is not a reality for millions of In fact, about 40 million private sector workers do not have access to retirement savings plans at their jobs and are struggling to make ends meet.  Several States, including my home State of Oregon, have developed and are ready to implement innovative solutions that will help workers save for retirement. Municipalities are also interested in stepping up to address this challenge and help their residents save. These are people who do not have a plan currently. They want help; they need help in saving.  So in August of 2016, the Department of Labor issued its final rule providing guidance and clarity to States and private sector employees on the kind of State-based payroll deduction retirement savings programs that would not be subject to ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security  As part of that August 2016 final rule, the Department of Labor indicated that it would initiate another rulemaking process to consider whether and how to include other jurisdictions. The Department of Labor invited and considered public comment on this process.  As a result, in December of 2016, the Department of Labor issued a final rule that would allow certain localities under specific conditions to establish retirement savings programs.                              {time}  1530  To be eligible, the locality must have an authority under relevant State law; it must be larger than the least populous State, which is currently Wyoming, at approximately 600,000 residents; it must not be in a State that has already enacted a statewide payroll deduction savings plan; and it must implement and administer the plan for its workers.  Now, according to the Department of Labor's final rule, three cities, New York City, Philadelphia, and Seattle, were identified as having potential interest. New York City's comptroller has noted that 57 percent of the city's private sector workers do not have access to a retirement plan at their place of employment.  This final rule just went into effect last month, and now my friends on the other side of the aisle are rushing to repeal the rule and prevent the Labor Department from issuing any substantially similar rule in the future.  Congress should be in the business of helping people save for retirement, not in the business of unfairly limiting or jeopardizing workers' ability to save for retirement; nor should Congress go out of its way to undermine the rights of cities and counties to implement innovative solutions that are needed for their residents.  I urge my colleagues to reject H.67 and get to work on meaningful solutions to address our country's retirement security crisis. America's working families deserve the opportunity to be able to save enough to retire with dignity and security.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

So, today, my colleagues aren't coming here and saying: We have a plan; let's help these people save for retirement.

I urge my colleagues not to undermine the work of those cities and municipalities that are working to enact innovative solutions. Again, these are managed by investment professionals. There are investor protections in these plans. People do not have to participate, but they are hungry for this opportunity. Millions of people across the country are watching.

Their quick and decisive actions over one tense weekend this past September helped to apprehend a suspect in three bombings in New Jersey and New York, a potential terrorist attack on American soil in which one of the three bombings alone injured 31 people in  As they do every day, these police officers, firefighters, and first responders worked swiftly and efficiently to protect our communities from further harm. Their courage, spirit of service, and commitment to protecting our communities ultimately helped to apprehend an individual who, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was an admirer of Osama bin Laden and Anwar al  I greatly appreciate the efforts of the Linden, NJ, police officers who apprehended the suspect following a shootout between the suspect and law enforcement. Authorities located the suspect in Linden after a collective manhunt was organized by officers from Manhattan, Elizabeth, Linden, and communities along the Jersey A trial is now pending.  I am grateful for the close coordination of New York and New Jersey law enforcement at the municipal, county, State, and Federal levels. Everyone worked together and shared actionable intelligence in real time, which ultimately led to the capture of a suspect before more bombings could occur. This critical sharing of information, paired with the swift action of law enforcement, played a key role in preventing further casualties.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the first responders who risk their lives each and every day for the safety of our communities. Our police officers and first responders represent the best of who we are as a nation, and we, as citizens, have an enduring responsibility to support them. As President Obama said during the hunt for the perpetrator of these bombings, ``We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure we don't succumb to that fear. And there's no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.''  These American heroes answered our call when we needed them the most, and we stand together as a grateful nation in expressing our undying gratitude.

1041,topic-id,7548,"Mr.President, very good to see you. I want to again, as I stated in the past, thank the staff. We are obviously pushing late into the night, and there are unsung heroes who are here in the U.Senate working in a nonpartisan way, keeping the Senate going. I want to thank them all for being here tonight. Definitely, the folks who are typing with their fingers are heroic. They have muscles in them. Thank you very much for your work. Of course, I want to just highlight the pages and thank them for yet another late night, when they still have calculus homework, I am sure, to work on.  Mr.President, I am honored to be able to join my colleagues, three of whom themselves are some of the great voices, in my opinion, in the United States on issues of the environment, issues of protecting the health and safety of our communities: Senators Merkley, Whitehouse, and I am grateful to be able to stand with them, joining them in a chorus of conviction about our opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  The EPA is a critical Federal It was established through an Executive order by President Nixon and charged with the protection of human health and the protection of the environment. Given the pressing health issues, environmental challenges we face in our Nation, and frankly the growing environmental challenges around our planet today, we should make sure we are confirming an Administrator who has a conviction for the protection of the health and safety of people; that he or she prioritizes the well-being of Americans and is focused tirelessly, exhaustively, on making sure the mission of the Agency is made real, that other factors, conflicts, wealth of industries--that their 1 concern is not all of those things but is really the health and safety of people, of Americans, because we know what it means when the health or safety of Americans is undermined.  This idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is completely compromised if cancer rates are going up because of toxic dumps or superfunds or asthma rates are epidemic because of toxins in the air.  We need a person who is in charge of making sure we are not prioritizing polluters or industries; that we are prioritizing people first and their safety. This is not just a moral calling of this Agency, but it is actually a practical one too. It is an economic one, too, because the cost to society of pollution, we already know, is extraordinarily high.  I see this in the community where I live. I am a proud resident of Newark, NJ, but I see a polluted river, the Passaic River, that has caused health issues, that has taken away sports and recreation, actually taken away a source of bounty of fish and clams and other shellfish. In addition to that, now it is costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up the waste and mess that was made by corporations that were allowed to get away with that polluting. That is the common sense of this.  Not only is it an issue of justice--something our country stands for, this ideal of justice--not only is it compromising life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but it also ultimately costs us so much more not to be vigilant in the protection of our environment. It is actually stealing, as we have seen all across this country--stealing from future generations. As you pollute now, you are stealing from future generations and calling it profit.  So this is what I see as a person who is in charge of this Agency, someone who is putting health, common sense, pragmatism before the short-term avarice that often has undermined the great bounty of this  In this particular case, in this moment in time, with this Agency started by a Republican, we now have a President who is not only putting someone up who is singularly unqualified--and as a person who worked with EPA Administrators, Republican and Democratic, we had a great Republican Governor from New Jersey who was the head of the Republicans and Democrats, if you compare this person, it is my conviction that he is singularly unqualified to lead the Environmental Protection Agency at this moment. That is Scott  I do not believe Scott Pruitt will lead this Agency in a way that upholds this critical mission in our country. Again, I don't care if you are in a so-called red State or so-called blue State, I don't care what your background is, your religion, your race, if you are living in an environment that is toxic--the air, the water--it is undermining your ability to enjoy the liberty and the freedom and justice of our country.  So if you look at this individual, Scott Pruitt, if you look at his track record, you will see that his actual work has undermined the mission of the Agency that he is now nominated to lead.  At his confirmation hearing, Scott Pruitt stated, as attorney general for the State of Oklahoma, he was responsible for protecting the welfare of Oklahoma citizens. This was his statement. Yet during his 6 years as attorney general, Scott Pruitt spent his time doing the bidding of the polluters, and filing or joining 14 lawsuits against the EPA's effort to clean up the air and water of a State, challenging water and clean air rules.  On top of this, on top of his track record, not for doing things to improve the quality of the air and water but doing things consistently to fight the EPA--on top of this, on one of the largest issues going on with our planet right now, Mr.Pruitt says clearly that he denies the science and the reality of climate change.  So many in his own community who have come to this building to give their voice and their facts believe this person being nominated has a nonexistent record in Oklahoma when it comes to protecting the environment and that he actually aided and abetted many of the people who were doing some of the worst harm to the water and to the air.  Mr.Pruitt seems to say this is a philosophical thing; that he is a What amazed me, as I dealt with Mr.Pruitt, engaged with him during the hearings, is it exposed the fact that he not only tried to get the Federal Government to stop acting to clean up the air and water and constrain the avaristic polluting of these industries, but he actually worked to make sure the State government didn't have the power to do it as well, as I will show momentarily.  But here is somebody who is not into philosophy. The driving force is his picking polluters over people. Mr.Pruitt also has serious conflicts of interest. What is amazing to me is that he has stonewalled the Senate, claiming to us that all of the emails from his agency that should be open--listen, we went through a whole Presidential campaign with all of this talk about email. How ironic is it that we are now putting someone up for EPA Administrator who suddenly is not allowing open public record requests to view his emails.  This is hiding, as Senator Whitehouse has gone through--not allowing the public to see what is their right to see--the emails and communications he has had with polluting industries, as well as other organizations plowing money into his campaign and others. Not only has he denied us access to that, but he has used lies that this could not be produced.  Well, we have just had a judge in Oklahoma, contrary to what he said, force the viewing of these emails. This is really important. Here is a judge who literally calls his failure to release the emails an abject failure, that not releasing these emails in accordance to the public information laws of the State--the judge called it an ``abject failure'' to not produce this information and called it ``unreasonable under the law''; those are the quotes--and ordered him to release these thousands of emails, to release the first tranche on  These are records pertaining to communications with Devon Energy, Peabody Coal, and other organizations. These should be released on We are going to see a lot in these emails.  Then he was ordered to release another tranche to organizations like ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council that supports a tremendous amount of partisan policy, the[[Page S1288]]State Policy Network, and other organizations. Those will be released in 10 days.  By the way, the requests for those go back to April 27, 2016. So one thing I have to say that I object to--and actually I am shocked and appalled that, suddenly, when you have a judge now forcing the release of these emails, which are going to give us transparency, which are going to answer the questions many of us have been asking about the conflicts he might have and how he used or potentially abused his power working in collusion with private industry, we can now see all of this plainly. But suddenly, now, this vote on Mr.Pruitt has been scheduled for tomorrow. Why not wait to let the Senators who have been asking for these emails for months--now that we are finally getting them, why are we now rushing a vote before we get to analyze his record?  So for these reasons--his lack of qualifications, his demonstration of working against the mission of the Agency, his denial of something as important and significant and planetarily consequential as climate change, his clear demonstration of his work on behalf of polluting industries, and the potential for serious conflicts of interest--we should not only oppose him, but at the very least what we should be asking is to have the vote postponed until the transparency that has been requested by Senators is achieved.  Any of these deficiencies individually should have us move the vote or vote against, but let me take some of these issues now. Let me look right now at the issue of climate change and his positions. The EPA is the most important Agency in the United States in the fight against climate change. Through its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is tasked with regulating harmful air pollutants, including carbon dioxide.  I do not believe that Scott Pruitt will adhere to this EPA mandate. It is an EPA mandate that he has shown a disregard for that he will be tasked with enforcing. He not only has no record of enforcing it, but even believing in the harm that these pollutants can cause. He has openly questioned the need for climate change action on numerous occasions. He is on the record for pondering whether climate change is even happening at all.  Less than a year ago, he told a public audience the debate about climate change is just that, a debate. He has said that climate change is a religious belief and a political bumper sticker. Scott Pruitt appeared to walk back that language on climate denial during his confirmation hearing before the committee of jurisdiction, the Environment and Public Works Committee, last month. He claims that science tells us that the climate is changing, and human activity in some manner impacts climate change. The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuous debate and dialogue, as well it should be.  Well, I am happy to see that he is moving. But here Mr.Pruitt now is taking a different tactic. He is acknowledging that our climate is changing, without accepting the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary cause. But this seemingly softer language is actually a damaging tactic and in many ways is just as damaging as outright climate denial.  This is a hallmark of the new strategy: Hey, let's admit the climate is changing, but let's try to cast doubt on whether human activity is doing it. The language may be different, but the implication is the same: If we don't know how much human activity contributes to climate change, hey, then we don't need to do anything about the crisis.  This reminds me of Big There were these big tobacco scientists who made their living insisting that the link between cigarettes and lung cancer was uncertain. To cast doubt on it was their strategy--that link between lung cancer and smoking. This is a strategy we have seen before, again and again and again. Even though there is a consensus of science about smoking--or in the case of climate change--cast doubt, cast doubt. That is what Scott Pruitt does; he is a merchant of doubt when it comes to climate change.  He is attempting to sow uncertainty where there is, in fact, considerable certainty. As a result, he is deliberately undermining and misrepresenting the reality of the case. This is the person we want to put--who is intended by the President to be put at the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, someone who is a merchant of doubt.  Well, let me just go through the climate change evidence. Let's be clear about the facts. There are extraordinary indicators to provide strong evidence not just for climate change but for rapid, human-caused climate change. Atmospheric carbon dioxide now is higher than at any point in recorded history; 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001; the pace of global sea level rise has doubled in the last decade; surface ocean acidity has increased by 30 percent since the beginning of the industrial revolution.  Those are dramatic changes in what is happening to our oceans. The evidence of this is global, from the bleaching of reefs to the killing of the biomass, to the extinction of species.  Arctic sea ice is declining by over 13 percent per decade. Just yesterday, scientists published a large research synthesis that has detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around the world, a long-predicted result of climate change that is expected to have severe consequences for the marine ecosystem and fisheries.  Some 97 percent of the actively published climate scientists agree that these climate change trends--I would say crises--are extremely likely due to human activity. Scientists this month released an estimate that human activity is causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces alone would cause.  I just sat with an incredible author who wrote ``The Sixth Extinction,'' a book that documents the rapidity with which we are now in a period of global climatic extinction, with species disappearing from the planet Earth at a speed that she compared, in the larger perspective of time, to the impact of a massive asteroid that was one of the major extinction periods. This is happening rapidly, like no period before in history, except that of massive climactic events like the asteroid hitting This is a crisis. The crisis is already being felt in terms of human impacts. Right now, we know that, unabated, these climate trends will continue to have impacts, and they will grow more devastating for our planet, especially for our children and our grandchildren.  By 2045, some east coast cities could flood three times a week. Scott Pruitt's home State may not have to worry about this, but New Jersey, a coastal State--we now have everyone from people in the military to businesses, to leaders in government, all realizing that this is going to have a serious effect on our State and we have to start preparing now to deal with that crisis.  Weather patterns are going to become more erratic. Hurricanes and other major storms in the North Atlantic will become stronger and more intense. Drought and heat waves will increase in parts of Arizona, California, Texas, and, yes, even Oklahoma could exceed 100 degrees for over 120 days a year. The U.crop yields will drop significantly. Estimates suggest that under a business-as-usual scenario, by 2100, wheat yields could drop 20 percent, maize by 40 percent, soybeans 40 percent, causing global spikes in food prices.  The rising seas, with more intense storms and worsening drought, could create climate refugees. In fact, we are seeing climate refugees already form small island states. The United States is already facing the reality, with many of these people from around the globe, that several communities in low-lying coastal areas in Alaska and Louisiana are in the process of relocating to higher ground. It is happening right now, where you are seeing evacuations from coastal areas that are no longer habitable.  Regarding climate refugees, I would like to quote Pope He said:       Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by the      phenomenon related to warming, and their means of subsistence      are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystem      services such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have      no other financial activities or resources which can enable      them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters.      Their access to social services and protection is very      limited.[[Page S1289]]  The Pope continues:       There has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants      seeking to flee from growing poverty caused by environmental      degradation. They are not recognized by international      conventions as refugees; they bear the loss of the lives they      have left behind, without enjoying the legal protection      whatsoever. Sadly, there is widespread indifference to their      suffering, which is even now taking place throughout our      world.  All of this--and perhaps lastly--it is this global insecurity that will grow. Major climate events like drought and floods have clearly been linked to violent conflicts around the globe. Climate extremes are worsening tensions in some parts of the world. There is a widespread international scientific agreement on the scope of this problem and international urgency about doing something about it.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has unequivocally concluded that there is a clear human influence on the climate system. To keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, the IPCC estimates that we need to reduce emissions by 40 to 70 percent by 2050, compared to the 2010 levels. Warming beyond this level, 2 degrees Celsius, is often cited as that threshold.  Warming beyond this level will result in surface temperatures above anything our planet has experienced in the last 100,000 years. Given current emissions scenarios, keeping temperature increases below this 2-degree threshold will be extremely challenging, but this only underscores the urgent need for rapid and dramatic emissions reductions.  Unsurprisingly, given these numbers, there is also an international agreement on the need for action. We are seeing people come together and make strong commitments. In 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever binding global climate change agreement in The national commitments established in the Paris Agreement would put us on a trajectory to limit warming to 2.7 degrees Celsius--not enough of a limit, but it is a start. It is a start and a remarkable moment in planetary cooperation.  There is no question that given planetary cooperation, there is no question that given a consensus of scientists, there is no question that, given the factual urgencies being created by climate change, Scott Pruitt is on the wrong side of history in refusing to acknowledge global scientific and political consensus on climate change and the urgency that we need to act. We are potentially going to put someone who stands against this global consensus in charge of the  Much of the opposition to climate action in our country is motivated by false narratives about economic costs--people who are selling this idea that somehow doing the responsible thing is going to hurt our economy. The idea that addressing climate change could actually make us less of a wealthy nation is propaganda, and it is propaganda that is being pushed by the people who are doing significant amounts of the polluting, the people whom Scott Pruitt has spent time advocating on behalf of.  Last year, Mr.Pruitt parroted the argument that fighting climate change is bad for the economy. He parroted that on an Oklahoma radio station, arguing that climate action is ``hurting our ability to manufacture, to grow our economy, it's hurting the fossil fuel industry, it's an assault, and it's all done outside of the Constitution and the law, which makes it even more egregious.''  That is a strong statement. Besides the fact that addressing climate change is very much within the law, this economic devastation narrative is simply patently false. Just last month, a renowned climate economist who had long argued that emissions reductions would damage economic growth actually changed his mind after running a more accurate analysis of carbon dioxide's impact on temperature.  In fact, responding to climate change will help grow new parts of our economy. Last year, nearly half a million Americans were employed in whole or in part by the solar energy and wind energy industries. Wind energy jobs grew by 32 percent in 2016, and solar jobs grew by 25 percent. Solar jobs, in fact, have tripled since 2010. We should be focusing on actively expanding our promising clean energy sector. Frankly, we should be racing, as the great Nation of innovation that we are, to lead in these areas and not let our competitors get there first. We should be doing the breakthroughs, making the investments, growing the jobs.  Scott Pruitt is one of the last stand-offs. In fact, the GOP--the Republican Party--is the only major political party in the developed world that refuses to acknowledge that climate change poses a problem. All of our other allies--their right parties, their left parties; you name it--all the other major political parties on the planet Earth recognize that this is a problem, but it is unconscionable that we, here in America, are still pushing a narrative that is contrary to the global consensus and the consensus of science, that denies the reality of human-caused climate change and the urgent need for action.  Recent polling says that nearly 8 out of 10 registered voters--people on the right and the left, especially with our millennial generation--support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Seven out of 10 registered voters support setting strict carbon dioxide limits on coal-fired powerplants, a core aspect of the Clean Power Plan that Scott Pruitt and the Trump administration have vowed to repeal. Seven out of 10 registered voters think the United States should participate in the Paris Agreement, another critical moment where the planet was coming together in cooperation. Seven out of 10 voters agree that we should be a part of the global movement to cooperate on dealing with climate change.  Nothing in Scott Pruitt's record as Oklahoma attorney general suggests he will uphold Americans' desire for climate action. A public servant who abides by the wishes of polluting industries, instead of the wishes of the American people, instead of the real tangible health challenges in their own State--someone who is standing with the industries and contrary to people suffering in their own State--has not earned the right to be our Administrator of the  Look at his record in Well, let's just start with air pollution. At his confirmation hearing, I asked Scott Pruitt if he knew how many children in his State had asthma. He did not know. So I informed him. According to the data published by the American Lung Association, more than 111,000 children in Oklahoma--more than 10 percent of all the children in Oklahoma, so more than 1 out of every 10 children in Oklahoma--has asthma. This is one of the highest State asthma rates in the This is a crisis.  As former mayor of Newark, I know the devastating impact that asthma has on parents and children. This is the number one health-related reason why kids miss school not only in my city, not only around my State--it is still one of the top reasons, if not the top--but in our  I have talked to parents and teachers about this crisis, about kids who are struggling to breathe, children rushed to emergency rooms, children missing school. This is literally undermining kids' ability to succeed in school and to get the benefits of life from academic success.  In a State where more than 1 out of every 10 kids--a State where more than 10 percent of your children--have asthma, clean air should be an urgency.  So what did Scott Pruitt do, as it relates to air pollution? Well, he actually took every major possible opportunity to help the polluters, joining with them to block the EPA from taking action to clean up the air and protect the children in his  When I say ``joining with them,'' and that is not a hyperbolic exaggeration. Scott Pruitt sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2011, accusing Federal regulators of grossly overestimating the amount of air pollution that natural gas companies were releasing from well sites in The letter was sent to the EPA on Mr.Pruitt's official attorney general letterhead. So we might assume its contents represented the State's official stance on what was best for the welfare of Oklahoma families and children because, as he testified, his job was to represent what was best for the welfare of Oklahoma's families and children.  This is what he said in his testimony here in the This is what he said. That was his job. So he is writing a letter, challenging the EPA, saying they grossly overestimated the amount[[Page S1290]]of air pollution that natural gas companies were releasing.  Well, the problem is that we would be wrong if we had thought that this was something that his office came up with. No, what Mr.Pruitt did was actually take a letter written by lobbyists at Devon Energy, one of the State's largest oil and gas companies, change maybe a few words--maybe three, maybe four--and, basically, took these words, took off their letterhead, put the same letter on his letterhead, and passed it along to the  Remember, Devon Energy is one of those organizations that we want the emails from, back and forth between his office.  Now, did he go out from his position and do research on air quality? Did he interview families with asthma? Did he test air quality? How did he come up with his conclusions that what the EPA was doing was wrong?  Well, clearly he couldn't write his own letters. He just took the information from Devon Energy, put it on his letterhead, and sent it off. He was doing the bidding of one of the people, one of the companies that was undermining the air quality for the 1 out of 10 children that have asthma.  So we, as U.Senators, who believe in thorough vetting--we hear a lot about intense vetting for refugees; I am a guy who just wants a thorough vetting for nominees--asked for his communications, using public FOIA, or the Freedom of Information What are your communications with this company that seems to be writing your letters for you?  What he said to us was--he stonewalled: I can't get those things to you.  Well, thank God a judge in Oklahoma has now ordered him to release it, calling a failure to do so an abject failure.  Well, great, we are going to see the letters to understand what kind of cooperation or even collusion he had with these companies, but we are going to see them too late because the vote is tomorrow. We are going to get that information a day, 2 days, a few days too late.  So here is someone who says his job, as attorney general, was to represent the welfare of children and families. Here we have a State with a crisis in air quality, a crisis in asthma, and where the EPA is working to do something about air quality in the State, and he is coming to conclusions that we don't know if they are his or not, but we know there are industries that do not want to change their practices at all and want to continue to pollute the air.  Whose side is Scott Pruitt on--the side of the children in his State, 1 out of every 10 who has asthma, or of Devon Energy? And we want to put him in charge of the EPA, without even having a thorough understanding of what his relationship was with these companies.  Well, my colleague did his own exhaustive research about the campaign funding he had received and more support from companies like this, and it creates an implication. Well, let's get to the bottom of what is happening. Let's see the emails before we vote. What do these say to these corporations?  I asked him: He allowed polluting companies to write emails to the EPA on his letterhead; did he let any children with asthma or their parents write letters that he then just put on his letterhead--people who were suffering from the poor air quality?  Later, the director of government relations at Devon Energy emailed Mr.Pruitt's office--this, we do know--to express gratitude to the attorney general for sending the letter.  Beyond this note of thanks, there were other clear benefits of this type of behavior for Mr.Energy industry lobbyists and executives worked tirelessly to help Mr.Pruitt raise his profile as president of the Republican Attorneys General As president of this nationwide group, Mr.Pruitt set up something called the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a super PAC that allowed corporations benefiting from the actions of Mr.Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general to make unlimited and anonymous donations. This super PAC raised $16 million in essentially untraceable fundraising in 2014 alone.  Companies were partnering with him to fight the EPA in its efforts to fight for cleaner air in a State with children struggling from widespread asthma challenges. This would be bad enough, but this in many ways is only the beginning of Mr.Pruitt's collaborations with air polluting corporations. Scott Pruitt filed two lawsuits challenging the EPA mercury and air toxics standards.  So the EPA is working to clean up mercury. He filed lawsuits against the EPA to stop them. These were the first Federal standards to require powerplants to limit their emissions of such toxic air pollutants. The EPA's final rule set standards for known hazardous air pollutants emitted by coal- and oil-fired powerplants above a certain generating capacity.  This rule sought to limit Americans' exposure to airborne toxics like mercury. Mercury in the air settles on the surfaces of water and land where rain washes it further into surface water. Once in the water, mercury is converted to a toxic chemical called methylmercury, and this accumulates in increasing levels up the aquatic food chain. It is one of the reasons that doctors often will advise pregnant women not to eat certain fish because of the high mercury content. Why is there a high mercury content in some of those fish? This is the reason: mercury spewing out into our air, coming down and settling on land and water, getting into our waterways, and working its way up the aquatic chain, ultimately getting into our food.  Humans, especially young children and pregnant women, are vulnerable to mercury exposure from consuming contaminated fish or shellfish. This is a tragedy. Over 400,000 newborns are affected by mercury pollution each year in the United States--400,000 of our children, the greatest hope for our country, 400,000 children affected by mercury pollution each year in the United  What does mercury exposure do? It damages the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and it damages the immune system of people of all ages but, again, particularly vulnerable populations. It is a horrific toxin. This is not an argument. It is scientifically clear that the largest source of mercury air emissions are our power companies. It doesn't mean we want to shut the powerplants down; it doesn't mean we want to stop them. We want to take measures to remove the mercury emissions.  So what happened in the State of Oklahoma to hundreds of thousands of our children? What happened in the State of Oklahoma? The man who was on the job--he told the U.Senate that his job was protecting the welfare of the people. What Mr.Pruitt did is attack the He said that they lacked the legal authority to regulate powerplant mercury emissions and other hazardous pollutants under the mercury and air toxics standards. He did not do this once; he did it twice. When the EPA moved under the mandate they had, he tried to stop them twice.  He went even further than that because he apparently doesn't even believe that mercury is toxic to humans. In his challenge to the EPA's mercury rule, this is what he wrote: ``The record does not support the EPA's findings that mercury . . . pose[s] public health hazards.''  Reading this was astonishing to me. This was written by someone whom we want to put in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency? I am sure that even his family was told not to eat certain fish because of mercury. It is astonishing to me that he would say that ``the record does not support the EPA's findings that mercury . . . pose[s] public health hazards.''  Mercury is a scientifically proven, well documented, deadly neurotoxin, and the person we are about to elevate to head the Environmental Protection Agency when he had the chance to fight to protect people from mercury not only fought to stop efforts to restrain mercury being put into the air and into our water, he went as far as to say: Hey, this stuff isn't so bad.  While he was focused on attacking these mercury standards and denying its status as a toxic metal, the number of lakes in Oklahoma with mercury-related fish consumption advisories has doubled since 2010. Think about this. The attorney general, in charge of protecting people, has the Federal EPA saying: Hey, you have a problem here. Let's address it. The mercury levels in your lakes have doubled since 2010. The scientists and experts in your State are[[Page S1291]]releasing advisories to your community that state: Don't eat the fish from Oklahoma's lakes. His response is to fight against efforts to clean that up in support of those industries, as we are finding out, that are pumping money into his super  If I lived in a community and I lived next to a river that had deadly toxins in it--I have spent my entire professional career as a city councilman, as a mayor, and now here to fight to clean the Passaic I swore an oath to defend people. I am fighting for them.  What did Pruitt do when he had a shot to be there for the people who were living by lakes that literally had a doubling of the advisories about fish consumption? What did he do? Did he stand for the people or the polluters? What did he do? It is clear what he did. He stood with the polluters.  But there is more. Scott Pruitt filed a lawsuit challenging EPA's 2015 national ambient air quality standards for ozone. The Clean Air Act required the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards for air pollutants considered harmful to the public health and the environment.  Under this authority in 2015, the EPA strengthened the standards for ground-level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion, based on substantial scientific evidence about ozone levels on health. This updated ozone standard improved public health protections, particularly for children, older adults, and people who suffer from lung diseases like asthma. The new standard will prevent hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks. This is not rhetoric; this is scientifically based. The reductions will save hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks.  As already stated, Oklahomans have some of the highest incidence of asthma in our country. But like the mercury contamination in the lakes, this excessive asthma rate did not stop Scott Pruitt from trying to block EPA from regulating harmful air pollutants under the national ambient air quality standards. So this is Scott  The list goes on and on and on, of his attacks on the environment, of his doing the bidding of the polluting corporations, of literally taking his letterhead and taking their letters and putting them on his letterhead and using that, not his own research, not his own interviews with scientists, not his work connecting to people with asthma--which, unfortunately, in his State with one of the highest asthma rates isn't hard to find--not talking to the people who were in his State releasing advisories not to eat the fish because of increased mercury content. What he did was the bidding of the polluting industries, and he sued the EPA again and again and again and again and again.  The EPA estimated in 2015 on their regional haze rule--this is the Agency he is about to take over--that implementing the rule would prevent 1,600 premature deaths, 2,200 nonfatal heart attacks, 960 hospital admissions, and over 1 million lost schooldays and workdays. That is the EPA's estimate on one rule, the regional haze rule.  Think about that. He is going to lead an Agency where the scientists in that Agency are going to be telling him: Hey, this rule that you fought against is going to save lives. What is his response going to be?  Can we as Americans trust that he is going to run an Agency where he relies on science or is he going to run an Agency where he relies on polluting industries to give him advice on what he should do? If he relies on them, there will be 1,600 more premature deaths, 2,200 nonfatal heart attacks, 960 more hospitalizations. We will suffer. People will suffer.  Scott Pruitt also filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA cross-state air pollution rule. This rule tightens limits on the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution that powerplants in 28 States in the eastern United States are allowed to emit. Once in the air, this pollution drifts across state borders, meaning that States that had no role in contributing to the pollution suffer the repercussions. It is this type of interstate pollution that EPA is especially well positioned to address.  Further solidifying his stance as a staunch opponent of climate action, he filed four lawsuits. He filed four lawsuits challenging the EPA Clean Power He also sued the EPA to challenge the Clean Air Act 111(b) standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new powerplants. And in all those lawsuits except one, Scott Pruitt joined with the polluting companies that were also suing the  So amidst all this in the confirmation hearing, I asked Scott Pruitt, given all those lawsuits he had filed with the polluters against the EPA to block the EPA from reducing air pollution--he had even filed one lawsuit on behalf--he literally was advocating for polluting industries to the point where he was even using their letter on his letterhead to make his point. So my question was, in all this fighting against the EPA, all of this, using their words, using their facts, not the scientists in your community, not the scientists telling you about the mercury in the lakes and the fish that you shouldn't eat and one of the highest asthma rates in the Nation, I asked him: Have you ever filed at least one lawsuit on behalf of those 111,000 children in your State with asthma? Have you filed one lawsuit on their behalf to try to reduce the air pollution and help those kids? Have you ever filed one lawsuit as attorney general of the State? And his answer was no.  Had he ever tried as Oklahoma attorney general to take any action--any action to help those children who struggle with asthma? What reason did Mr.Pruitt give for failing to even try? Mr.Pruitt stated that he lacked the statutory authority to file that type of legal action.  Let's think about that for a minute. Again, it doesn't take a law degree to understand the problems with that statement. You see, Scott Pruitt was more aggressive than any other attorney general in our country's history in suing the EPA, often using completely novel theories in court that lost--novel theories that lost. He was trying to find all kinds of ways on behalf of polluting industries to stop the EPA and thought of using creative legal approaches for doing it. Yet, when it came to the children in his State, 111,000 children suffering from asthma, one of the highest rates in our country, could he think of one novel thing to do on their behalf? Did he file one lawsuit to try to help those children? No, he claimed he lacked the legal authority.  What Scott Pruitt lacked was not legal authority. What I believe he lacked was any interest in trying to truly help those kids, to stand up for people against polluters. Those sick children were not powerful. They didn't have millions of dollars for a super They couldn't make campaign contributions. It seems, when it comes to their advocacy, that they were not important enough for him to even try.  When Mr.Pruitt was questioned by a reporter on his practice of letting polluting companies write letters challenging EPA regulations, which he then copied onto his official attorney general letterhead and he then sent, this is what Scott Pruitt said. This is his defense for letting polluting companies write letters that he put on his letterhead and then sent off to the EPA, advocating for them: ``That is actually called representative government in my view of the world.''  That is, simply, not an acceptable world view for the head of the Environmental Protection His view of representative government isn't any one of those 111,000 children. His idea of representative government isn't a family living next to a lake from where they are advised not to eat the fish anymore. His idea of representative government isn't pregnant mothers who are worried about eating fish that are caught in the His idea of representative government is giving voice to the polluters--to the powerful, money-laden interests--and not to those of the people.  If Scott Pruitt wants to be the EPA Administrator, we as Americans should insist that we have transparency into what he did in his work beforehand--what he did on air quality, which I just went through. But the truth of the matter is that it is the same story for water pollution in the State, and it is the same story for other health and safety issues that the EPA was doing.  I conclude by saying that it is unfortunate that, at a time when we are finally going to get transparency into Scott Pruitt and what he has been doing as attorney general, after his stonewalling week after week, month after month, saying he wasn't going to release these records--by the way, the[[Page S1292]]person in charge of enforcing Oklahoma's Freedom of Information Act is the attorney general. So it is kind of ironic that the attorney general was refusing to enforce them himself--the laws that public officials have to abide by in the It finally took a judge to order him to release that transparency. Now we are going to get these letters and see more about his connections to polluting companies--what kind of potential collusion went on and what conversations went on. Was he fundraising even from his official capacity? What was happening?  Alone, that is unfortunate that we are not, at least, postponing this vote until we get transparency in the Our role, as spelled out by the Constitution, is to advise and consent the President on these choices, and we are about to vote on somebody on whom we don't have full transparency to give advice.  The final point is that here is someone who is going to be the head of an agency that was started under the Nixon administration that is focused on protecting the health and safety of Americans, and he has demonstrated in no way his commitment to doing that--that he is putting people first. More than that, he has the ability to pull back these regulations that he himself has been fighting and that the scientists are saying will literally save lives.  It is not just what he will do. It is what he won't do in that job that is so threatening and so potentially devastating to families and communities like the one he is coming from. I cannot support someone who denies climate change, someone who clearly prioritizes polluting companies over people, someone who has spent his career in not protecting folks but in fighting the  I end where I began, with this Nation's ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

1080,topic-id,732,"Mr.President, I rise today to reintroduce the Law Enforcement Officers' Equity This good-government bill will provide Federal law enforcement officers with the Federal benefits they deserve for their service. I thank Senator Rob Portman for being an original cosponsor of this bill.  There is perhaps no harder job in the United States than that of law enforcement officers. Each day, brave men and women work under tremendously stressful conditions to keep our communities safe. From apprehending violent criminals to arresting drug kingpins, these brave men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for a higher cause. We owe them our sincerest gratitude for their service.  Due to the high level of training required for their job and the ever-present danger in their profession, Congress determined that Federal law enforcement officers should receive higher salaries and enhanced benefits compared to other Federal employees. Unfortunately, due to a technical error,[[Page S1307]]nearly 30,000 Federal law enforcement officers classified as G5-0083 police officers do not receive enhanced benefits under the United States As a result, certain officers who work for Federal agencies--such as the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.Postal Service, U.Mint, National Institute of Health and many more--receive lower pensions as compared to other law enforcement officers with similar responsibilities. It makes no sense that postal police officers or any other Federal law enforcement officers receive less benefits even though they have the similar duties and functions as other law enforcement officers.  The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would fill in this gap in the law and expand the number of Federal law enforcement officers who can receive benefits. The bill would expand the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' for retirement purposes to include all Federal law enforcement officers. The change would grant law enforcement officer status to the following individuals: employees who are authorized to carry a firearm and whose duties include the investigation or apprehension of suspected criminals; employees of the Internal Revenue Service whose duties are primarily the collection of delinquent taxes and securing delinquent returns; employees of the U.S Postal Inspection Service; and employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs who are Department police offices. These officers face the same risks and challenges as the men and women currently classified properly under Federal law as law  The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would allow incumbent law enforcement officers' Federal service--after the enactment of the act--to be considered service performed as a law enforcement officer for retirement purposes.  This legislation has the support of law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' Association, and the Law Enforcement Action  Fundamental fairness demands that we close this loophole in Federal law and give all Federal law enforcement officers the retirement benefits they deserve-Trask my colleagues to support the Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act, and I urge its speedy passage.                                 ______                                       By Mr.McCONNELL (for himself and Mr.Paul):  429.

When cars became popular in the 1920s, the company seized the opportunity and began making large billboard frames.  When its parent company wanted to sell the plant, Mr.Heddles wasn't impressed by any of the potential buyers. He knew how important this plant was to his community. So Mr.Heddles organized a management buyout and eventually became the owner of the company, known today as Tiffin Metal  Under Mr.Heddles' leadership, Tiffin Metal Products continued to demonstrate the kind of adaptability and creativity that enables a company to grow and thrive. Today Tiffin Metal Products remains one of the two main manufacturers of large billboards in the country, while also making custom products and a popular brand of specialty lockers for law enforcement.  Mr.Heddles took pride in his role in American manufacturing and in keeping his company true to its Ohio roots. Over the years, Tiffin Metal Products has provided good jobs to hundreds of people in Tiffin and Seneca County, and those workers have shown the world that Ohioans know how to make things and make them well.  Will Heddles also took pride in his community, giving generously to local service programs and the arts and helping establish the Seneca Industrial and Economic Development Corporation, a private nonprofit organization working to drive positive economic and community development in the area.  He will be missed by his family, church, community, and the men and women who have been a part of Tiffin Metal Products, a great Ohio manufacturing success story.

1135,topic-id,1619,"Madam President, I speak in opposition to Scott Pruitt, and I thank Senator Carper for the good work he has done in leading the opposition to someone who is a climate change denier and will not release information that the public should see.  I want to say a few comments about the majority leader's comments. I am incredulous that he thinks this has been unfair to the Trump administration and Republicans; that we have not moved faster. We know a bunch of things. We know President Trump didn't begin his vetting process, as most Presidential candidates do, in  We then know right after the election he fired his person in charge of vetting and of the transition. We know then he appointed people without vetting them because he wanted to speed it up, and we also know that a number of people who President Trump nominated were billionaires and Wall Street bankers, and they had very complicated financial backgrounds and holdings, and because the Trump administration didn't do it, the Senate had to do it, and the media had to do it--to look at the backgrounds of some of these nominees.  Then, on top of that, we saw a level of corruption we had never seen in Presidential nominations. We saw a Secretary of Health and Human Services--passed by being voted for by every Republican--who bought and sold healthcare stocks while a Member of Congress, voting on and sponsoring healthcare amendments and bills.  We saw other nominees. We saw Secretary Mnuchin, and Senator Carper played a role in this, now-Secretary Mnuchin, who forgot to disclose a $100 million investment he had and then lied to the Senate committee, as pointed out by the Columbus Dispatch--the most conservative paper in my State--about robo-signing, sending hundreds of people in my State into foreclosure.  The ethics of these nominees are such, and then you have Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the EPA, and he will not disclose 2,600 emails that we know how--as Senator Carper has done such a good job on--we know how a number of these emails point to--I am not a lawyer--if not the word ``collusion,'' certainly doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry that he might occasionally want to regulate instead of the That is the story.  I want an Administrator of the EPA who wants to protect the country's great natural resources, not someone hell-bent on undermining the Agency he will lead. The environmental challenges we face in my State are too great to put the EPA in the hands of someone with a track record of putting polluters before public health, of choosing companies that pollute over communities that are victimized by that pollution, and too often he is doing the work of campaign donors instead of the public.  I know what the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts have meant to my I know what Lake Erie looks like. When I was a kid, I lived about an hour and a half away. Lake Erie was an environmental disaster. The counties of Cuyahoga, Erie, and Lorain couldn't clean it up. The State of Ohio didn't have the resources to clean it up.  It was only that terrible fire in Cleveland where bridge trestles on the Cuyahoga River caught on fire that got the Nixon administration to move and create the EPA, and then we cleaned up Lake That was one of the great accomplishments in our country's history--environmental and otherwise, one of the great accomplishments.  It was a Republican administration with the Democratic Congress, when good environmental policy was bipartisan, when Republicans as well as Democrats believed in being stewards of the Earth in following a number of the teachings of the New Testament about being stewards of the  It was a sustained effort by citizens and by their elected officials in both parties to protect our public health. The EPA affects the water that comes into our children's drinking fountains. It affects our small businesses that rely on tourists at our lakes and beaches. It affects farmers who feed the According to Aparna Bole--a pediatric specialist at Cleveland's University Hospital in Cleveland--asthma rates in my part of Ohio are above the national average because of the region's poor air quality.  Climate change is not some distant problem. We tend to think about wildfires in the West or devastation faced by coastal communities, like those affected by Hurricane The Midwest is affected too.  In August, 2014, a harmful algae bloom left 500,000 Ohioans in Greater Toledo, in Northwest Ohio, without safe drinking water for nearly 3 days. This is Lake This is more or less the natural color of Lake This is the algal bloom. It is a stunning, beautiful picture if you don't know what it is, but when you see a boat cutting through these algal blooms and seeing what this meant, as the algae chokes Lake Erie--Lake Erie right here is about 30 feet deep. Contrast that with Lake Superior, 600 feet, and you will see why Lake Erie is more vulnerable.  Lake Erie is 2 percent of the water in all the Great Lake Erie has 50 percent of the fish of all the Great The fish like shallower and warmer water, but they don't like these kinds of algal blooms and what they do to this community. Because it is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, and this is the shallowest part of this great lake, it is uniquely vulnerable to these harmful algal blooms.  We know these blooms are caused by excess nutrients in our water--untreated sewage, urban runoff, and runoff from farm fields. This Maumee River Basin going into the lake from the south, going into the lake just north of Toledo, drains the largest 2 million acres, the largest basin of any tributary going into any of the Great  On Wednesday, I met with David Spangler, a charter boat captain on Lake We talked about how the Great Lakes region has seen a 37-percent increase in heavy rain events. We have seen that hotter summers make the blooms worse. We talked about protecting the lake as one of the great environmental challenges, not just for Ohio or even the industrial Midwest but protecting Lake Erie and the Great Lakes, the greatest source of freshwater in the world, by most measurements--how important that is.  Dave has been fishing on this lake and its tributaries for decades. He bragged about the improvements we[[Page S1368]]have seen over the year--how water quality has improved, how walleye and yellow perch populations have rebounded, how he leads fishing expeditions on the Great Lakes, on Lake You know what, look at what these algal blooms have done. You can guess what they have done. Nobody will go fishing in these kinds of waters.  If the algal bloom is there too long, lots of fish die in addition to that. We need an EPA Administrator who understands that the contamination hurts everything from our children's health to our small businesses. He told me he doesn't think Scott Pruitt is the right person for this job. He believes that with Scott Pruitt at the helm of the EPA, we would likely lose the gains we made in the lake.  Of particular concern to both Mr.Spangler and me is that Mr.Pruitt said mercury does not cause a threat to human health. Really? Mercury doesn't cause a threat to human health? If Mr.Pruitt doesn't believe that, I would like him to explain to me why the Ohio EPA, the Ohio Department of Health--both with Republican administrators--have a statewide mercury advisory stating that women of childbearing age and children under 15 are advised to eat no more than one meal per week of fish from any Ohio water body. Think about that. You shouldn't eat more than one meal a week of fish taken out of any of the Ohio aqua system--limit the amount of fish eaten from our State's largest body. That means even though we worked for decades to reduce mercury emissions, apparently Mr.Pruitt doesn't think mercury exposure is a threat to public health.  Mr.Pruitt has solicited thousands of dollars of campaign contributions for himself, the Republican Attorneys General Association, all the Republican attorneys general. There are three dozen or so of them. They work together to raise lots of money to keep themselves in office so they can continue to do some of the work they do. Some of the work they do is stand in the way of good environmental policy.  He has refused, for years, as Senators Merkley and Carper have pointed out consistently, to disclose some 2,600 documents, showing correspondence between his office and the very companies he is supposed to ensure follow the law.  We know who some of those companies are. What is he hiding? Why won't he tell the Senate what is in those documents? Why does the Senate Republican leader not want us to see those documents? Because he is saying, no, we have to vote on this now. It just happens to be we will be looking at documents over the next few days, but apparently it is not going to be able to affect this vote.  It could be because in the past he submitted letters to the EPA that were written by the companies he is supposed to regulate. Think about that. An oil company writes a letter and then that letter remarkably ends up pretty much word for word to be sent to the  Allowing him to become EPA Administrator is like allowing an arsonist to become the fire chief--the goal of both is to burn things down.

This process allows those who are accountable--the elected Representatives in the Congress--to fight for their constituents' rights and liberties.  House Resolution 123 provides for a closed rule for each of the Congressional Review Act resolutions, both H.43 and H.69, the standard procedure for such resolutions, since the sole purpose of each is to remove a harmful regulation from the Federal  The rule allows for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the majority and the minority leader or their designees, for H.43, and 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the Chair and the ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources, for H.69. On each resolution contained in the rule, the minority is afforded the customary motion to recommit.  H.43 is a joint resolution which would repeal the Obama administration's midnight rule that takes away States' ability to direct funding within their own borders to certain healthcare providers that conform to the States' values.  In her final days in office, Secretary Mathews Burwell pushed forward a rule that would require States to fund, with public dollars, facilities that perform abortions, potentially against the will of the people of that given This flies in the face of the 10th Amendment which grants to States the authority to make such decisions within their borders and to prioritize which healthcare providers should receive funding based on the greatest need in their own communities.  Those of us who care about the carefully crafted Federal system which our Founding Fathers set up, which allows different States to operate differently based upon their own values and priorities, recognize the Obama rule for what it is: a power grab by the Federal This is why the House will take up this resolution today--to continue to fight for states' rights--and will repeal this burdensome regulation that ties the hands of every State legislature and ties the hands of every Governor in the  H.69 is a Congressional Review Act resolution to repeal an overreaching regulation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service which usurps Alaska's ability to manage its own lands within its own borders. Federal law has long recognized that Alaska--that Alaska--and her elected officials are in the best position to make the decisions on what actions to permit on the public lands in that State, whether those lands are Federal, State, or private.  Despite this long precedent, codified by Congress in the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act, the Obama administration moved forward in its waning days with a rule that imposes Federal restrictions on lands that have been, up until the end of the Obama administration, successfully regulated by the State of Like H.43, this resolution recognizes the important 10th Amendment protections put in place by the Founding Fathers in our Constitution which protects states' rights to govern within their own borders.[[Page H1194]]  The Congressional Review Act is an important tool in maintaining accountability at the Federal level. Its necessity has never been more apparent than over the past few weeks where this Congress has needed to step in and remove burdensome and unbalanced regulations put in place by President Obama and his team just as they were walking out the door.

Just in the way of background, December 16, 2016, the Obama administration finalized a rule that prevents States from eliminating abortion providers from title X grant distributions. Title X is a family planning program authorized in 1970, and was intended to provide family planning services to low-income women. The Obama rule was widely perceived as an attempt by the Obama administration to require States to fund Planned Parenthood, the Nation's largest abortion business.  Prior to the Obama administration's rule, States were free to direct their title X funds to healthcare providers that did not participate in abortion. When States had this freedom, they were able to choose to invest in women's health care instead of investing in Big  States should be able to choose to prioritize family planning funds to health clinics that offer a full range of healthcare services, including family planning, but do not participate in abortion.  States can fully support family planning and other health services without funding abortion providers like Planned Planned Parenthood only comprises 13 percent of approximately 4,100 title X service sites.  Redirecting funds away from abortion providers does not reduce funds for the title X program. When States set criteria that eliminates abortion providers from title X distributions, those funds are then directed to other clinics.  Eighty-seven percent of current title X service sites are comprised of local health departments, local hospitals, and Federally qualified health centers.

They go on to say: ``This final rule boldly preempts the authority of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to manage wildlife for both recreational and subsistence hunting on NWRs, which authority of the state is affirmed by Congress in the Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska National Interests Land Conservation Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement The FWS final rule was premised on a meeting as a priority the FWS policy on Biological Integrity, Diversity and Environmental . . .

331,topic-id,1160,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter written to the Honorable Sylvia Mathews Burwell signed by 110 Members of the House and Senate to express strong opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services' September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled ``Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients.''                                Congress of the United States,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2016.     Sylvia Mathews Burwell,     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services,          Washington,       Dear Secretary Burwell, We write to express our strong      opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services      (HHS) September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled      ``Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients      in Selecting Subrecipients.'' Although we appreciate the      Department's intent to follow proper regulatory procedure      pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, HHS's purpose      for engaging in the rulemaking appears on its face to be an      attempt to subvert the will of elected representatives.       Moreover, apart from the Department's impetus for the      notice of proposed rulemaking, we also question whether the      Department's stated rationale adequately supports its      conclusion that providers with a reproductive health focus      are more ``effective'' than other health providers that offer      comprehensive care for women and men. Nowhere in the proposed      notice of rulemaking does HHS clearly define what it means to      provide Title X services in an ``effective'' manner. It does      appear to assert that a number of factors--such as the range      of contraceptive methods on-site, the number of clients in      need of publicly funded family planning services served, and      the availability of preconception care--distinguish providers      with a reproductive health focus as more ``effective'' and      ``high quality'' than other types of providers. However, that      list of factors falls far short of all of the attributes and      recommendations included in the Centers for Disease Control      and Office of Population Affairs report entitled ``Providing      Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and      the US Office of Population Affairs.''       To further complicate the argument about quality and      effectiveness, the data cited in the notice of proposed      rulemaking is not adequate for determining patient outcomes.      The Department relies heavily on utilization and demographic      statistics, but appears to lack hard data regarding actual      patient outcomes and need, as the Department does not require      grantees to track patients or verify their income. As you      know, the issue of inadequate data has previously been raised      by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), after the HHS Office of      Family Planning in 2007 asked IOM to provide a critical      review of the Title X Family Planning In addition to      finding ``no clear, evidence-based process for establishing      or revising program priorities and guidelines,'' IOM stated      the following in its May 2009 Report Brief:       ``The committee concludes that the program does not collect      all the data needed to monitor and evaluate its impact.      Therefore, the committee proposes a comprehensive framework      to evaluate the program and assess how well clinics meet the      family planning needs of the program's clients. The committee      concludes that additional data will be needed in the areas of      client needs, structure, process, and outcomes in order to      assess the program's overall progress.''       We welcome evidence that this recommendation has been fully      adopted, but are unaware of any clear evidence confirming      that to be the case. If HHS cannot clearly define an      ``effective'' or ``high quality'' provider, it is unclear to      us how state and local project grantees are supposed to do so      in order to comply with this proposed rule. It is also      therefore unclear how HHS will be able to accurately      determine in every case whether state or local project      recipients--who are generally closer to and more familiar      with subrecipients and the patient base in their geographical      region--have considered inappropriate criteria in evaluating      subrecipients. Rarely do the American people benefit when the      federal government attempts to substitute its judgment for      that of state or local governments--particularly when the      criteria used to inform that judgment are unclear, and that      judgment is not supported by coherent and impartial facts.       Finally, if HHS is going to assert the authority to adapt      its rules in order to address changing circumstances, we      implore HHS to consider the recent general shift in health      care policy toward comprehensive care. As HHS states on its      website, in addition to assisting individuals and couples in      planning and spacing births, part of the mission of Title X      is to contribute to ``improved health for women and      infants.'' HHS's suggestion that subrecipients like federally      qualified health centers--which provide greater preventive      and primary health care services than providers with a      reproductive health focus--are per se less ``effective'' than      providers with a reproductive health focus does not comport      with that stated mission.       We urge HHS to reconsider this overreaching and ill-     supported rule. We will continue to closely monitor this      proposed rulemaking, and intend to submit this letter as a      formal comment. We look forward to a detailed response from      your           Sincerely,     Joni Ernst,       United States     Diane Black,       United States       Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Bill      Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve      Daines (R-MT), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Deb Fischer (R-NE), James      Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Jerry      Moran (R-KS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Marco      Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Tim Scott (R-SC), David      Vitter (R-LA).

(a) The select committee may, subject to the      provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information      in the possession of such committee after a determination by      such committee that the public interest would be served by      such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to      disclose any information under this section, the committee      shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any      member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of      the select committee shall disclose any information, the      disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a      vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of      such information or after such vote except in accordance with      this section.       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to      disclose publicly any information which has been classified      under established security procedures, which has been      submitted to it by the Executive branch, and which the      Executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee      shall--       (A) first, notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader      of the Senate of such vote; and       (B) second, consult with the Majority Leader and Minority      Leader before notifying the President of such vote.       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such      information after the expiration of a five-day period      following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted      to the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader and the      President, unless, prior to the expiration of such five-day      period, the President, personally in writing, notifies the      committee that he objects to the disclosure of such      information, provides his reasons therefore, and certifies      that the threat to the national interest of the United States      posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it outweighs      any public interest in the disclosure.       (3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies the      Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the      select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such      information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority Leader      and Minority Leader jointly or the select Committee, by      majority vote, may refer the question of the disclosure of      such information to the Senate for consideration.       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the      question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under      paragraph (3), the Chairman shall not later than the first      day on which the Senate is in session following the day on      which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for      its consideration.       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on      which the Senate is in session following the day on which any      such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier      time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the      Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of      rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate      shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the      pending business. In considering the matter in closed session      the Senate may--       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of      the information in question, in which case the committee      shall publicly disclose the information ordered to be      disclosed,       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion      of the information in question, in which case the committee      shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be      disclosed, or       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the      committee, in which case the committee shall make the final      determination with respect to the public disclosure of the      information in question.     Upon conclusion of the consideration of such matter in closed      session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth      day on which the Senate is in session following the day on      which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of      the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the      majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5      of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever      the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the      disposition of such matter in open session, without debate,      and without divulging the information with respect to which      the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of      such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses      (A), (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph.      Any vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant      to this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member      of the Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within      the time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule KM      of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure of      such information shall be made consistent with that right.       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select      committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of      any department or agency of the United States which has been      classified under established security procedures and which      the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of      this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be      made available to any person by a Member, officer, or      employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the      Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the      committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of      such information, make any information described in paragraph      (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of      the Whenever the select committee makes such      information available, the committee shall keep a written      record showing, in the case of any particular information,      which committee or which Members of the Senate received such      information. No Member of the Senate who, and no committee      which, receives any information under this subsection, shall      disclose such information except in a closed session of the            (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on Ethics      to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence      information by a Member, officer or employee of the Senate in      violation of subsection (c) and to report to the Senate      concerning any allegation which it finds to be substantiated.       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any      such investigation, the Select Committee on Ethics shall      release to such individual at the conclusion of its      investigation a summary of its investigation together with      its findings. If, at the conclusion of its investigation, the      Select Committee on Ethics determines that there has been a      significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized      disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate,      it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend      appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee      membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a      Member, or removal from office or employment or punishment      for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.       9. The select committee is authorized to permit any      personal representative of the President, designated by the      President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend      any closed meeting of such committee.[[Page S1479]]       10. Upon expiration of the Select Committee on      Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence      Activities, established by Senate Resolution 21, Ninety-     fourth Congress, all records, files, documents, and other      materials in the possession, custody, or control of such      committee, under appropriate conditions established by it,      shall be transferred to the select committee.       11.

299,topic-id,189,"Mr.Speaker, for the sake of our country, I was relieved that General Michael Flynn resigned from his post as National Security Not only did he mislead the Vice President and the public on his secret conversations with the Russian government, he may have also violated Federal law.  But what is just as concerning is that the Trump administration was aware of General Flynn's misconduct weeks ago and did nothing about it. The American people deserve to know what President Trump knew, and when he knew it.  And let me be clear: General Flynn's resignation is not the end of the Trump administration's shady ties to We still don't know President Trump's financial interests in Russia because he refuses to release his tax returns.  We still don't know the extent of Russia's disturbing interference in our election because our calls for an investigation have been stonewalled.  And we just learned that the Trump campaign was in regular conversation with Russian intelligence officials.  President Trump's coziness with Vladimir Putin is an urgent matter of national security.  It is time that the Trump administration truly put America first, rather than the                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1191-4.txt,2127,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,15.0,February
1405,topic-id,563,"Mr.Speaker, I join with my Illinois colleagues, Mr.Shimkus, Mr.LaHood, and Mr.Hultgren, who will speak in just a moment, to recognize the life and the legacy of a great man who dedicated his life to service.  For decades, the hardworking men and women of Peoria were proud to have Bob Michel fighting for them in the United States House of And even though we were from opposite parties, I learned a lot from Bob Michel, who had been a friend of my family for decades.  Like a lot of men and women from his era, Bob Michel believed in America to his core. He believed in the midwestern values that have made our heartland a great place to live, work, and raise a family. Hard work, service, community, and working together to achieve a common good, these are the values that Bob Michel lived by.  Bob Michel could have gone into business and become a wealthy man. He could have left Peoria for a big city. He could have done anything he set his sights on. But what Bob Michel did was he decided to give back to the community that had given him so much, and he gave a life of service.  It was in 1956 that Bob Michel ran and won his seat representing Peoria and several communities across central Even though he went to Washington, Bob Michel's heart was always in He never lost sight of his profound responsibility to the people that he served. For nearly 40 years, he rose through the ranks of Republican leadership to become the longest serving minority leader in our Nation's history.  Even though I might not have agreed with him on every single vote that he cast, Bob Michel proved that you can disagree without being disagreeable. Over the last several days, I have heard from Members from both sides of the aisle about their memories of Leader Michel, and there are several things that we can all agree on.  First, if Bob Michel gave you his word, you could always count on it.  Second, if you had a good idea, whether you were a Democrat or a Republican, if it helped the families that he represented, you could count on his support.

62,topic-id,2406,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 116 provides for consideration of two joint resolutions designed to protect working families by blocking harmful regulations through the Congressional Review Act process.  In 1974, Congress passed and President Gerald Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or This legislation, which has broad and bipartisan support, sets standards for employer-provided retirement plans to protect the workers of the United States of This regulatory framework for employer-provided retirement plans has been largely successful at helping working families save for retirement over the last 40 years.  Unfortunately, in the waning days of his administration, President Obama put forward regulations to uproot this system that has worked for decades. The Obama administration's rules would pave the way for government-run IRAs--for bureaucrat-run IRAs--managed by States and certain municipalities. Employees in several States would be forced to automatically enroll in these government- and bureaucrat-run IRAs that are not subject to the important protections established by  In other words, in the waning days of the Obama administration, they sought to take back from workers the protections that were given to them when ERISA was passed 40 years ago. Let me say that again. Workers' ERISA protections will be out the window for those people in these government- and bureaucrat-run plans.  These regulations remove important protections for American workers as they relate to their retirement plans. American consumers would be directly hurt by this regulation were it to go forward.  Just as bad, workers would have less control over their retirement savings. Withdrawals or roll-over investments to a private-sector account could be restricted and even penalized.  These regulations would create disincentives for small businesses to offer their retirement plans and invest in their employees' retirement, resulting in fewer options for workers. Instead, smaller employers will likely simply shift their employees on to these government- and bureaucrat-run plans.  These regulations could also create a confusing patchwork of rules that vary State to State or, even worse, city to city. This confusion would directly hurt the consumer.  Another concern with pushing people on to government- and bureaucrat-run retirement plans is that taxpayers would end up footing the bill. We have seen how poorly managed many State and city pension plans have been all over this country. If these government-run IRAs are also mismanaged, taxpayers may be asked to pay and to honor the government's promises.  Ultimately, these regulations are simply another attempt to exert control over the American people with a ``government knows best'' policy.  Mr.Speaker, the American people are not children that need direction from their parents. They should not be forced by the heavy hand of the government and faceless bureaucrats to obtain certain plans the government[[Page H1140]]likes that they may not need or want. People are free today to decide whether they want their IRAs or not. This will put them in a position where they can be forced to have them whether they want them or not.  We have seen the problems caused when the government tries to tell the American people what to do or what the government thinks is best for them. These types of heavy-handed policies simply do not work and they are counter to the principles our country was founded on.  So these two bills would use the Congressional Review Act process to block these anti-consumer regulations from taking effect. By passing these two bills, we will protect working families, we will support our Nation's small businesses, and we will be shielding the taxpayers from potential liabilities.  As I pointed out last week on this floor, just because we pass these bills using the CRA does not mean we cannot continue working toward solutions that improve our Nation's retirement programs. Just as the CRA gives Congress power to block regulations, the legislative branch can also give agencies further instructions and directions if a regulation is needed at some point in the future.  As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find solutions to help Americans save for their retirement. Attempting to use the regulatory pen to skate around ERISA and its important protections is just not the right answer.  So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this rule and these pro-consumer bills and protect American families, workers, and their retirement plans.  I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1230  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.Byrne) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, we are less than 2 months into 2017, and today we have another closed rule, or as I call them, ``Putin rules.'' This is how they operate in Russia--no deliberation. It is simply astonishing that here in the people's House we continue to have this closed process: no amendments, no debate, no nothing, completely shut down.  I have very serious concerns about the road we are traveling down. The 115th Congress is only 6 weeks old, and we have already ushered in a process that is alarmingly restrictive. It should distress not just Democrats, but Republicans as well. This is now the norm and is very, very sad.  Mr.Speaker, today's rule would pave the way for the House to repeal two important consumer protections that help working families save for retirement. These protections went through a very lengthy process of review. We are repealing these protections without the committees of jurisdiction having any chance to weigh in and in a rushed process that is completely closed.  These protections, as I said, were reviewed by the relevant agencies; they were subjected to public commentary; and we are bringing them to the floor to repeal them without even giving the committees of jurisdiction an opportunity to actually discuss these bills, to discuss whether this makes sense.  Mr.Speaker, America is facing a retirement savings crisis, and rules like this--I should say, protections like this--are essential to helping workers plan for the future. As of today, 55 million Americans lack access to a way to save for retirement out of their regular paycheck. As a result, nearly half of all workers have no retirement assets. Yet we know that employees are 15 times more likely to save just by having access to a workplace retirement plan. These programs are a commonsense solution for working families and small businesses.  Republicans should be working to strengthen programs like these, not rip them apart. If you have a problem and you want to make a tweak, maybe you ought to work with the agency to make that tweak, but not an outright repeal.  Quite frankly, Mr.Speaker, pushing dangerous bills like this in a closed process with no debate is a lousy way to conduct the people's business. But with the avalanche of alternative facts coming out of the Trump White House every day, it should be no surprise that the House Republican majority on Capitol Hill is carrying on in such a heavy-handed way. God forbid, in the people's House, we should actually deliberate and have debate and have the kind of give-and-take that the American people expect.  Mr.Speaker, as bad as this process is, as bad as dismantling the rules and regulations put in place to protect the savings of working families is, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about something that is very serious and troubling to the American people.  Mr.Speaker, this administration regularly goes on TV and appears before the press--and let me say this as plainly as I can--and consistently spouts falsehoods. Now, I am told, Mr.Speaker, that under the rules and precedents of the House that there are certain things that cannot be said. Mr.Speaker, as a member of the Rules Committee and as somebody who respects the precedents of the House, I am going to be very polite in how I respond here today. I will speak plainly, but politely. I want people to understand that I would like to say things much stronger based on what is happening in this country and based on what is happening in this administration.  Mr.Speaker, I certainly wouldn't want to do anything to hurt anybody's feelings, but it is troubling what is happening, the falsehoods and fabrications that we hear each and every day. Some of it is trivial and some of it is silly, like saying that his inaugural crowd size was bigger than President Obama's. Who cares?  But some are more sinister and more dangerous, like the claim that 3 million to 5 million ``illegal aliens'' voted for his opponent in the 2016 Presidential election. Every fact checker, every Secretary of State, both Republicans and Democrats, say this is absolutely false. There is no basis for this falsehood. It undermines confidence in our political system. My fear is that the real purpose of this claim is to put in place policies to restrict voter rights in order to make it more difficult for people to vote in this country.  Mr.Speaker, every day it feels like President Trump and his White House are trying to set a new record in terms of misinformation. There are so many falsehoods coming out of this White House, it makes me nostalgic for  President Trump, in a meeting with U.Senators last week, repeated another falsehood, that he only lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bussed to the State to vote illegally. This is simply not true. There is no basis for this statement. This is similar to the President's fabrication that 3 million to 5 million votes were cast illegally in the 2016 election. Plain and simple, President Trump and his White House staff continue to provide zero evidence to back up their claims of voter fraud.  On Sunday, when top White House aide Stephen Miller was asked about the judiciary challenging President Trump's unconstitutional Muslim ban, he aggressively attacked critics and said that ``the powers of the President to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.'' The powers of the President will not be questioned. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard that.  President Trump might talk a lot about his love for Vladimir Putin, but this is not This is the United States of We have checks and balances to stop authoritarianism. Kellyanne Conway, when she is not giving free commercials for the Trump family business on the taxpayers's dime, is making up stories about the Bowling Green massacre, a terrorist attack which never happened, and spouting alternative facts on a daily basis. The latest falsehood from the Trump White House is one of the most serious yet.  In repeated interviews, both Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn--I should be saying now, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn--said that Flynn did not speak with Russian officials about U.sanctions before President Trump took office. A new report shows that that is blatantly false.[[Page H1141]]  After the U.intelligence community overwhelmingly agreed that Russia had actively meddled in our 2016 Presidential election to tip the result in favor of Donald Trump, President Obama announced strong sanctions against Russia, including expelling 35 Russian diplomats or agents from U.soil. When Vladimir Putin responded by saying that they would not expel any U.officials in Russia--what many expected he would not do--a lot of red flags were raised. A new report now shows that, in the 24 hours that followed, Michael Flynn communicated with Russian Government officials about the sanctions and may have actively undermined U.foreign policy weeks before Donald Trump even took the oath of office. And now we know that last month the Justice Department informed the White House of Flynn's deception of the Vice President and of the American people in the days immediately following the inauguration.  Mr.Speaker, this is outrageous, and the fact that President Trump did not immediately fire Michael Flynn as soon as this came to light is stunning. I guess he was too concerned about crowd size rather than a deeply compromised national security adviser.  Mr.Speaker, getting rid of Flynn is not enough. President Trump must stop the blatant and dangerous falsehoods coming from his White We need a full and independent and bipartisan investigation not only under the purview of the intelligence committees; we need to have a full investigation out in the open so the American people actually know what happened and know how many others were involved in Flynn's undermining of our national security.  Who knew what when?  Was Donald Trump aware of these unauthorized talks with Russia while President Obama was enforcing sanctions?  The American people deserve the truth. They deserve transparency. They deserve this Congress to actually do proper oversight.  One of the most troubling parts of all this is that the American people would have been completely in the dark if it were not for the hardworking journalists and patriotic U.officials who helped bring this outrageous scandal to light. Now, more than ever, we need to support freedom of the press, to hold President Trump and his White House accountable.  The Republicans in Congress need to start doing their job by exercising the strong oversight needed. President Trump needs to know that he answers to the American people and he and no President is above the law.  Mr.Speaker, America's hardworking families deserve a Congress that puts them first and a President and a White House that tells the truth instead of spreading falsehoods to stir up fear and advance a dangerous and extreme agenda. We can have policy disagreements, but you have to tell the truth. You can't just make stuff up.  As we are seeing with this administration, alternative facts are contagious. The White House is rapidly losing the public's trust, and every day that Congress fails to hold the Trump White House accountable, we are losing the public's trust as well.  Members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have a responsibility to stand up for the truth and hold the President and his White House accountable. We are here to serve the American people, and they need to know that we are fighting for them, not serving as a rubber stamp for this administration.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1139-2.txt,2197,OPEN BOOK ON EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT,2017.0,14.0,February
63,topic-id,1837,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts' remarks. We are not here today to talk about Russia, but I do remember about a month ago when we were on this floor counting electoral college votes, my colleague from Massachusetts objected to the Electoral College votes from my home State of Alabama because of Russian interference.  I want to put his mind at rest. As a Representative of Alabama, I think I can say with complete confidence that the Russians had no influence over the Presidential vote in the State of Alabama last We get our electoral information like most people in America do: from watching FOX News or something like that.  But in the fall, in Alabama, we are also paying real close attention to college football. So far from letting Russian influence have anything to do with our vote in Alabama, we were doing what most people in America were doing and paying close attention to college football. We gave no more credence to what the Russians think about our political votes in Alabama than we do to what they think about our college football teams.  But let's get back to the substance of his remarks. He says that there is no debate. This rule provides for at least 2 hours of debate, perhaps more if we get into motions to recommit. And the truth of the matter is, under the Congressional Review Act, the actual form of these laws are prescribed by statute. We have no control over what can be in them. We can either vote for them or against them. And we are going to have clear debate--over 2 hours, maybe more--whether we are going to vote for or against it.  There are people who are going to vote for them, and there are people who are going to vote against them, and people are going to have reasons for doing each. That is standard order here in the I think the American people would agree, on these sorts of fundamental things when you know what is simply in them, that is plenty of debate.  He calls these regulations that we seek to overturn ``consumer protections.'' But remember what I said earlier: They take these employer plans, these IRA plans that are forced by the government, they take them out from the protections of They take consumer protection away from the people that have these plans. So far from being consumer protection regulations, they are anticonsumer protection regulations. They are antiworker.  So what is really going on here is this is not some effort--or was some effort by the Obama administration--to protect workers. It is an effort to try to get government more involved in people's lives, and the people of America don't want the government more involved in their lives.  The gentleman mentioned that there are 55 million people in America today who don't have a retirement plan. Every one of those 55 million people have access, if they choose to get it, to an Anybody can set up an You don't need your employer to set it up for you. You sure don't need the government to set it up for you. There are plenty of people around the country that will help you set it up, and it is pretty easy, pretty simple.  Maybe some of these people, or a lot of these people that don't have them, don't want them. So why would the government come in and tell them you have got to have them unless your real interest here is in empowering government and not protecting consumers? I will leave it to you to make the decision what the real motive was here.                              {time}  1245  Now, the gentleman talked about the fact that these come to us without going through the committees of jurisdiction; but, as I said earlier, because the form of these bills are prescribed by statute, there is really nothing for the committees of jurisdiction to do. But he will be glad to know that I am informed that, after we come back from the Presidents Day week break, there will be a number of bills coming to the floor that will have, in fact, gone through the committees of jurisdiction, including bills, I predict, that will both repeal and replace the Affordable Care So there is going to be plenty of things coming through regular order to this floor.  But as we go through the Congressional Review Act process, we are pretty constrained in what we can say and not say in these bills, and we are simply following that which is prescribed by statute. As I said earlier, we can all decide, based upon that statutorily prescribed form for what we do, whether we are for it or we are against it, whether we want to force workers in America to get some government-forced type IRA and take them out from the protections of ERISA, or[[Page H1142]]whether we want to let them have their freedom and keep the protections of  We want to keep freedom for the American people. We want to keep freedom for the American workers, and we sure want them to keep the protections they have had for over 40 years under ERISA and not take those protections away from them so that we can force something down their throat from some government-bureaucrat-run plan.  Getting back to what we are here to talk about today, we are here to reverse ill-considered regulations in the waning days of the Obama administration that hurt the American workers. By adopting this rule and by adopting these two pieces of legislation, we protect the American workers. I hope all of us are here to do exactly that.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman is correct, I did rise to object to certifying the electoral college vote. Part of it was because I was appalled by the unprecedented Russian interference in our election system. I would urge the gentleman to read--maybe he doesn't want to read the classified version of the report--the unclassified version of the report. It is pretty outrageous. That is why so many of us have been calling for an independent bipartisan commission to investigate this.  But the other reason why I objected was because of voter suppression. I would say to the gentleman that that is an equally serious issue, that there is still voter suppression in the United States of America, and it is something that we need to deal with. I worry very much under the Republican majority and under this White House that we are going to see more of an effort to restrict people's right to vote.  Now, the gentleman is trying to paint a rosy picture about what we are doing here. I mean, we have had 13 closed rules, 6 structured rules, zero modified open rules, zero open rules. By the end of this week, we will be a third of the way to breaking the record for the Republicans' most closed Congress in the history of the United States, and we are still in My friends have outdone themselves in terms of closing up this process, of shutting people out from participation.  The fact of the matter is, as I mentioned, these protections that the Republicans want to repeal went through a long process, lots of review within the agencies, lots of public commentary, a long time to develop these protections. Now, if the Republicans aren't happy with it, one of the things they might do is they could bring up these rules in the form of legislation where we could have an open process, and people can amend and add and change and do whatever they want to do to make it better, if that is what they want to do.  But that is not what they are interested in. It is all about a press release. This is mindless legislating. When committees of jurisdiction do not do their job, do not hold hearings, do not do markups, and all of a sudden the Rules Committee just reports something out and sends it to the floor under a closed rule, that is mindless legislating. By the way, I am on the Rules I don't think that we have yet had a single bill come before the Rules Committee that went through committee. I am happy I am on the Rules At least you see a little action going on, but I feel bad if you are on any of these other committees.  This is a lousy way to do business, and I am shocked that my Republican friends come to the floor and defend the indefensible. This is not the way this House should be run. This is the kind of process, as I said at the opening, you would expect to see in Russia, not here in the United States Different ideas should be debated. People ought to have an opportunity to have their voices be heard. But yet here, in this House of Representatives--which will break records in terms of being the most restrictive Congress, I think, in history--the name of the game is to try to shut people out. I think that is wrong. I think my Republican friends should be ashamed of the way they are conducting themselves in this This is not right.  I just point that out because I think it is important for people to note that, by the end of this week, my Republican friends will be a third of the way to breaking their own record for the most restrictive Congress in history, with the most closed rules. That is something that I don't think anyone should be proud of. But it is the new norm here: shut everything down, shut everybody out. I think that results in bad legislation and, again, mindless legislating like we are doing here today.  Mr.Speaker, we are all deeply concerned, as I mentioned in my opening statement, with the reports from our intelligence community regarding potential foreign interference in our most recent election. Everybody should be. Mr.Speaker, I am going to ask people to vote ``no'' on the previous question. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Swalwell's and Representative Cummings' bill which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate foreign interference in our 2016 election. With the revelations about General Flynn coming to light, and all that we know about his dealings with the Russians, this is extremely timely.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr.Swalwell).

64,topic-id,1391,"I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, when I was a young lawyer, an old lawyer one time gave me a piece of advice that I was fortunate to never have to follow. He said: Son, when you are strong on the facts, pound on the facts. When you are strong on the law, pound on the law. If you are weak on the facts and the law, pound on the table.  What we just heard is pounding on the table about Russia, and that has nothing to do with the two bills that are covered by this rule. Nothing in the bills that underlie this rule has anything to do with But because there is not a good argument against the rule, there is not a good argument against these bills, we are pulling up something else and pounding on the table. Let's get back to the rule and the underlying legislation.  This legislation will reverse two regulations that hurt working people in America, period, end of sentence. Far from being a press release, as my colleague from Massachusetts talked about, this bill is going to pass not only this House, it is going to pass the Senate, and, yes, it is going to be signed by the President of the United Two of the Congressional Review Act bills that have already come through this House have passed the Senate and, I am told, are going to be signed by the President this week. These aren't press releases. These aren't messaging bills. These are pieces of legislation that are going to become law and protect American workers after an attempt by the Obama administration, as it is going out the door, an attempt by them to take ERISA rights away from American workers through a regulation. I would think everybody in this body would be outraged, after 40 years of bipartisan support for ERISA, that we would think it is okay for anybody to take away workers' ERISA rights. It is not.  What we are doing today is the right thing to do, not if you are for Big But if you are for the American worker, this is the right thing to do. Rather than pound on the table, let's work together, pass this rule, pass this underlying legislation, and do the right thing for the American worker.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1300  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, there is one similarity with Russia and what we are doing here today, and that is the process. This is completely closed. This is totally undemocratic. There is no opportunity for amendment. There is no opportunity for different opinions to be presented here. So, again, this process is deeply flawed.  Again, my friends on the other side of the aisle may want to defend it, but I will tell you this is unprecedented. With the number of closed rules that we have seen, you are going to break all records.  My Republican friends also have the distinction of presiding over the most closed Congress in history. This will outdo that because they are moving in such a restrictive and closed way. This is not right.  The idea that we are going to repeal protections with an up-or-down vote without having the committees of jurisdiction even do a hearing, even to weigh the very points of view on this, to bring these bills to the floor like this in a way that would not allow people to improve these protections is outrageous. But this is the new norm here. Everything is shut down.  And the gentleman is right that the previous question maybe is a little bit off subject from the two underlying bills here, but as the gentleman knows, we are currently debating the rule. This is a tool used to set the House's agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation.  For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize and what agenda we would like to pursue in this Because the fact of the matter is, if we offer amendments to the Rules Committee by a 9-4 vote, we are turned down. We are shut out all the time.  So this is our only opportunity to be able to bring some of our priorities before our fellow Members in the House and to be able to let the American people know that some of us in this House are horrified by Russian interference in our election. It is unprecedented what they did. Anybody who sat through any of the briefings or even read the unclassified report, I don't know how you could not be horrified by the deliberate attempt to impact our elections.  And yet, we can't even get oversight in this The wagons have all circled around the You can't do anything that will make him uncomfortable. Well, the fact of the matter is this is about more than making a President of the United States uncomfortable. This is about defending our electoral system, defending our democracy.  And the gentleman from California, in arguing in favor of voting ``no'' on the previous question so we can bring up a bill that would allow there to be an independent bipartisan investigation of Russian interference on our election I think is even more important, given what we know about what happened with General Many of us said, when he was being considered for the top national security spot in the White House, that this was a bad choice. Why? Well, because this is a guy who regularly peddled in conspiracy theories, whacky conspiracy theories.  Members of the intelligence community, members of our Defense Department regularly said, when he was being considered, that this was a bad choice. My Republican friends said nothing. Now we realize just how bad a choice this was and how bad the President's judgment was in allowing a man like this to be elevated to such a high position in the White  There are serious questions that need to be answered here. I would say to my colleagues, rather than trying to dodge and rather than trying to hide and rather than trying to frustrate attempts to get to the truth, there ought to be a bipartisan effort, similar to the 9/11 Commission, where people come together and, in an open, transparent way so the American people know what is going on, are able to get to the truth. That is what we are trying to do here. We have no other means to be able to get our views heard--certainly not in the Rules Every amendment we offer is turned down.  So I would say to my colleagues, vote ``no'' on the previous question. Let us be able to bring up the Swalwell-Cummings bill and have a vote on it. If you don't want to do an investigation, then vote ``no.'' But this is important and, I would argue, more important than the underlying bills, given what we are faced with. This is serious business, and it is about time my friends on the other side of the aisle treated it as serious business.  I will just close, Mr.Speaker, by saying that I have served here now for 20 years, and I have gotten to know some of the finest people in this Chamber, both Democrats and I know there are a lot of Republicans who believe, as we do on the Democratic side, that we need to find out[[Page H1144]]what happened and we need to get to the truth. We don't want to see more attempts to block investigations.  I hope that those Republicans would join with us and vote ``no'' on the previous question because, if you vote ``no,'' we get to bring this up, we get to vote on it, and we still get to vote on the underlying legislation. This doesn't slow anything down; this doesn't stop anything; but it allows us, at this very important moment, to be able to debate something that I know a lot of people in this country are very concerned about.  Mr.Speaker, again, vote `no' on the previous question, and vote ``no'' on this closed, restrictive Putin rule.  I yield back the balance of my time.

65,topic-id,1260,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern) that this is, indeed, serious business. Looking out for the workers of America is perhaps the most serious business that we do.  We have heard a lot of speechifying about trying to do the right thing for the average person in On the way out the door, the Obama administration promulgated two regulations that attempt to force government-tight retirement on people when they don't want it and take away their consumer protection rights under That is very serious business.  But instead of having a debate about that, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle tried to switch the subject to something else because they don't want to have to defend the indefensible. These two regulations that these two CRA bills would reverse would take away protections for American workers.  This debate is not closed. I completely disagree with that assertion. We had a full debate on this yesterday afternoon in the Rules We devoted an hour of debate to it right now. Of course, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to chew up most of their time, instead of talking about this rule and the underlying legislation, talking about something else; but that is their right if that is what they want to do.  If they had some serious debate that they wanted to have on this rule and the underlying legislation, we wouldn't be talking about We would be talking about these bills. We would be talking about these regulations.  If this rule is adopted, we will have at least 2 hours of debate here on the floor on the bills themselves, and perhaps more if there is a motion to recommit. There is plenty of debate here. There is plenty of time to decide that you are for the American workers and protecting their consumer protection rights under ERISA or you are against American workers--either/or. It doesn't have anything to do with It has nothing to do with the Presidential election. It has everything to do with whether you stand with the workers of America or not.  I stand with the workers of I think the vast majority of the people in this body want to stand with the workers of If they do, I hope that they will vote for this rule and vote for the underlying legislation so that we can reverse these two regulations.  Mr.Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support H.116 and the underlying joint resolutions.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 116 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 All points of order      against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate      shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour      equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking      minority member of the Committee on Foreign After      general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment      under the five-minute rule. All points of order against      provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of      consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall      rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as      may have been adopted. The previous question shall be      considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to      final passage without intervening motion except one motion to      recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of      the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution      on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House      shall, immediately after the third daily order of business      under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the      Whole for further consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

955,topic-id,1175,"Mr.President, for the last 47 years, the EPA has enforced science-based environmental policies that have resulted in cleaner air and water, the cleanup of some of our Nation's most contaminated lands and waters, and has improved our understanding of our changing climate. All of this has led to a healthier  Bipartisan Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency--everybody from the great Washingtonian Bill Ruckelshaus to most recently Gina McCarthy--took on the role and responsibility as EPA Administrator, knowing that it was their responsibility to protect existing environmental law and to let science be the guide on research and new policies. They took the EPA mission to heart, and they fought to protect human health and the environment.  I have questions about whether the nominee, Mr.Pruitt, follows those same values, and I come to the floor to oppose his nomination to be the Administrator of the  Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly attacked needed EPA regulations, and he supports polluters at the expense of the environment and health laws. He doesn't believe the scientifically proven causes of climate change are real.[[Page S1241]]  Less than a year ago, then-Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, working in their State, wrote: ``Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.'' That was written in the Tulsa  When questioned by my colleagues during the hearing process, he said: ``The climate is changing, and human activity contributes to that in some manner'' but the degree of that contribution is ``subject to more debate.''  The reason I raised these issues is that this issue of climate and climate impact is so real in the State of It is already happening, and it is already affecting our industries.  As EPA Administrator, Mr.Pruitt would have the responsibility for setting the Agency's agenda, including how to respond to climate change, yet the fact that he doesn't support the existing climate change science puts him in a role where I think he would not protect the economic interests of our  We cannot have a lackadaisical attitude about these issues. It is not a hypothesis. It is here. It is happening.  In the Pacific Northwest, it is altering our region's water cycle, putting Washington's farming jobs and our $51 billion agriculture economy at risk. Wildfire seasons are longer and more severe than ever before. It is costing our Nation billions of dollars.  Warmer water temperatures in our streams and rivers have degraded salmon spawning habitat, led to massive die-offs, and certainly our shellfish industry has been very challenged.  With 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions being absorbed by our oceans, it is raising the acidity level, and that is impacting the chemistry of Puget Oceans and their absorption of carbon dioxide emissions and these acidic conditions are making it hard for our shellfish industry to do the type of seeding that needs to take place. It is severely impacting the Pacific Northwest's $278 million shellfish industry. Ocean acidification has been found to dissolve the shells of important prey species, and the ocean acidification effects then carry up the food chain, if they are not addressed.  If we have an EPA Administrator who isn't going to work to cut down on carbon emissions and thinks that it is only part of the impact, aren't there a lot of Northwest jobs at stake? For example, our maritime economy alone is worth $30 billion, so I would say there is a lot at stake.  In looking at the record of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, he fought EPA regulations that protect public health, including the cross-state air pollution rule, the regional haze rule, the clean air standards for oil and gas production sites, and the clean water rule.  Despite this issue of repeatedly suing the EPA, he recently told Congress: ``I do not expect any previous lawsuits to adversely affect my performance as EPA Administrator.''  Well, I have serious concerns about how Mr.Pruitt's past lawsuits will influence his aggressive attitude as EPA Administrator in not fighting for the things that are going to protect the jobs and economy in Washington State that count so much on a pristine environment.  A letter was sent by 773 former EPA employees who served under Democratic and Republican administrations, stating: ``Mr.Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest that he does not share the vision or agree with the underlying principles of our environmental statutes.''  His record does not give me the confidence that he is the right person to lead this Agency at this point in time.  But there are other issues. During his time as Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt planned the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil This summit brought together energy industry executives with attorneys general to strategize against EPA, and they specifically discussed EPA's overreach, as they put it, regarding a very important issue called the Pebble  The Pebble Mine is an attempt by some who want to actually establish a gold mine in the very place of one of the most successful salmon habitats in the entire world: Bristol Bay,  The EPA followed the letter of the law in their multiyear, science-based assessment of Bristol They basically made sure that everybody understood what was at risk: that Pebble Mine would destroy up to 94 miles of salmon spawning streams; it would devastate anywhere from 1,300 to 5,350 acres of wetlands; and it would create 10 billion tons of toxic mine waste, which is nearly enough to bury And all of this would occur in the headwaters of the greatest salmon fishery on Earth, where half of the sockeye salmon on the planet spawn.  So the notion that this is how this nominee would spend his time--as I said, the mine itself is a direct threat to the $1.5 billion salmon industry in Bristol That is 14,000 jobs just in the Pacific The importance of making sure that the mine is not located there is of the utmost importance, I say, to the salmon fisheries of the entire Pacific  I want to make sure we are putting someone in place who is going to fight for the laws that are on the books and to show leadership, not spend time trying to undermine the Agency, the organization, and its existing authority.  If Scott Pruitt allowed Bristol Bay to go forward, it would be devastating to our It would be voting in favor of these polluters instead of making sure that we are protecting science and environmental law.  I have very serious concerns, and that is why I am opposing this nominee. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will realize that these economies--the ones that depend on clean air and clean water, safe salmon spawning grounds--are dependent on our doing the right thing to protect what is really our stewardship of this planet that we are on only for a very short period of time. I hope my colleagues will consider all of this and oppose this nominee.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1102,topic-id,6775,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this morning to join my colleagues to speak on the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Like my colleagues who have been out here tonight, the great Senator from Illinois, Senator Duckworth, and my colleague from Hawaii who preceded her, we are here to talk about the importance of our environment and what a critical asset it is to each of our regions of the United  Certainly, you can say for the State of Washington that the environment is our economy--the beautiful aspects of our clean water, the resources of our beautiful mountains and wonderful streams, Puget Sound itself, our mountains that so many of my colleagues ask me about. These are all assets that make Washington State a great place to live, work, and recreate in.  Our companies would tell you that one of the great things they have in recruiting people to the State of Washington is that it is a competitive advantage to say their business is located in People understand what that means to the quality of life and to the opportunities for those workers. It is with that in mind that I rise in strong opposition to this nomination.  I had a chance yesterday to discuss Mr.Pruitt and to discuss some of the concerns that I have with his role as Administrator, and in Oklahoma in the attorney general slot, and also his nomination process. Many of my colleagues this morning have brought up his record, what that record represents, and their concerns about his answers to very important questions.  This is about stewardship. Stewardship is about how we are going to manage our resources and apply the laws of clean air and clean water to protect not just this generation of Americans, but future generations of  Mr.Pruitt's poor environmental record--in my opinion, he is choosing to side with those companies that have been polluters of clean water and failed to protect in an aggressive way the important public health issues that were before people in his  Obviously, there is a big discussion tonight. My colleagues have been out here discussing whether there is transparency in Oklahoma regarding his ability to discuss with them his failures or his successes, if you will, in a public process. That is why people have been demanding these emails. These important documents are things that, not only the people of Oklahoma, but people in the U.Senate have a right to have answers to as we consider his nomination.  I join my colleague from Hawaii in saying, What is the rush? What is the rush to push forward somebody as an administrator for something that is about the stewardship of our air and water--something that is going to be important, not just to our generation but future generations? We want an EPA Administrator who is going to protect that. That is what we want to know: Are you going to be an aggressive steward for future generations?  I had an opportunity a couple of years ago to hear one of the great authors who has written all these books about economics. He was talking about the great implosion of the economy in 2008, 2009. His point was that was going to cost future generations--not just this generation, but maybe three generations of Americans were going to be affected by that big great recession of our economy. It is the same issue tonight.  Our future environment is going to be impacted, not just for today, but for future generations by what the next EPA Administrator does. It is critical that we recognize the important need for clean air and clean water now and take steps to be aggressive about it.  This is something that is important to our State because it is affecting us economically. It is affecting us with water and ocean acidification, challenging our seafood industry and our food chain, and challenging us with wildfires. We want to make sure that we have an EPA Administrator who is going to do their job.  In my opinion, Mr.Pruitt has ignored big polluters and discharge in drinking water in In my opinion, he has not been strong enough with regards to the big oil and big mining companies who have attempted to undermine what is EPA law. As attorney general, he tried to undermine the laws that are already on the Federal books. It leaves my colleagues and I questioning, How could he ever stand up for those laws if he has spent so much time trying to undermine them?  He has helped organize strategies and discussions about how to aggressively stop the EPA from doing its job. Some of these discussions used the example of the Pebble The Pebble Mine is a mine that companies are proposing in Alaska at the headwaters of the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, one of the most important sockeye salmon runs in the world. So as EPA Administrator, when he is supposed to be protecting clean water, is he going to side with those mining companies? He spent a whole strategy session with them trying to figure out how to overrun Is he going to be the kind of person who is going to help us stand up for clean water so we can have salmon on the west coast? Or is he going to join with those who think that you can degrade the environment and still preserve these incredible resources?  I know that people think Mr.Pruitt and his statements about climate change are important. I agree because part of that stewardship on clean air is basically implementing and carrying forward strategies to make sure that polluters reduce pollution in our air and that we come up with a plan to diversify energy sources to reduce that pollution. I should say his job is not that, but it is clearly to call out what the Supreme Court has said is implementation of the Clean Air  My colleagues, I think, are failing to recognize that Mr.Pruitt's hesitancy on this issue is really going to cause problems or challenges for us here in the It is going to cause challenges for us to move ahead when we are seeing so much impact.  I know my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and I have asked the GAO for an analysis of what climate change is costing us. What is the impact of climate change costing us? Why did we ask for that letter over a year ago? Because we are seeing devastating impacts in the shellfish industry, in the timber industry, in various aspects of our economy as it relates to that.[[Page S1329]]  In the Tulsa World Mr.Pruitt said: ``Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.''  That is what he said in the newspaper in  I know several of my colleagues and I have further discussed exactly this issue, but the United States has made great strides to reduce carbon dioxide, and we need to have someone who is going to be aggressive about doing more work on this. The consequences of increased carbon dioxide have been everything from extreme weather patterns to impacts on water quality, which causes impacts to our salmon, to drought conditions, which a lot of legislation--various committees have been discussing exactly what to do about the drought situation in Washington, Oregon and I am sure it is going to continue into many other It is impacting even the chemistry of Puget Sound--something I will get into in a minute with ocean acidification.  To have somebody who doesn't get how aggressive we have to be on addressing these issues is very problematic. It is an economic issue.  I would like to say, as I mentioned earlier, it is about good stewardship because it is about future generations and whether someone did their job in leaving this place to the next generation, but it is also about economic issues.  Mr.Pruitt failed to be accountable as attorney general in releasing emails, and that is so much of the discussion today about his nomination. During his confirmation hearing, he repeatedly failed to answer questions. And he told Senators: Submit an open records request to the attorney general's office--his own office. It is as if Mr.Pruitt is taunting our colleagues, not answering the questions about his policy, hoping that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this side of the aisle will support him, even though he will not give us answers on his policies. And then he says: Well, if you want to know, you can submit an open records request. We have; people have. We want the answers, and a court today has said: Let's give people those answers.  We don't have those answers today, yet my colleagues want to rush to have his nomination pushed through when something as important as the environment is at stake.  On average, Oklahoma State government agencies complied with their open records request within 68 days. That was the average, yet Mr.Pruitt, as attorney general, has taken over 2 years. A few weeks ago when a lawsuit was filed against Mr.Pruitt on this very issue, the suit requested that he respond to 9 open records requests, asking for as many as 3,000 emails.  As I just said, yesterday, a judge said that he has to turn over those records, those documents, and he has to do so by It is not a long time to wait. It is not a long time to discuss the concerns that our colleagues have with this position. In fact, I would be happy to come back on Wednesday and make sure we have consideration then, giving people time until But people are pushing us to vote for this nomination tomorrow or, I should say today.  What do my colleagues not want to see in the Pruitt emails? What is it that they don't want to know? Attorney General Pruitt has been part of close to 30 anti-environmental legal actions. Is that what they don't want to see?  I know one of my colleagues has said he is going to make polluters pay. He is going to assure that these issues are implemented.  Scott Pruitt has sued the EPA 14 times. He fought the cross-state air pollution rule. He fought the regional haze rule. He fought the clean air standards for oil and gas production sites. He fought the clean water rule. He fought the mercury rule twice, and he fought the Clean Power Plan four times.  So are my colleagues interested in giving this job to someone who has fought the EPA and tried to stop them from making sure that polluters pay? This is what the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency is, to make sure that we have good stewardship.  In one case, Attorney General Pruitt failed to pursue a Phillips 66 refinery in an Oklahoma City, which the EPA found was one of the worst polluting refineries in the entire country. Phillips 66, in this case, impacted groundwater. That was the pollution in this case. Yet Scott Pruitt failed to enforce the environmental laws there.  As attorney general, Scott Pruitt has been absent in other cases. There was a groundwater case and pollution by Where was the attorney general in that case?  In another case, in Bethany, the city's water wells were impacted by a toxic plume of chemicals that impacted access to safe drinking water.  This case is still going on. But the attorney general failed to step in and protect those citizens.  So this is what we want to understand, given what Attorney General Pruitt said in his testimony: Ask for requests. Get the emails. See the positions.  That is what we have done. As we can see from his record, he knew very well it took a long time, that he had every tool to make this a very hard process for people to get the answers. Yet we are now within days of having those answers. My colleagues want to go ahead and vote.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt was asked to identify lawsuits he filed against private companies in Oklahoma for violation of pollution laws. Despite these examples I just mentioned, Mr.Pruitt could think of only one specific instance in which he filed a settlement after his predecessor completed an investigation into how a dozen or so poultry producers illegally disposed of animal waste. So let's take a closer look at that case.  The poultry companies in the northeast corner of Oklahoma were not properly disposing of 300,000 tons of animal waste per year. Attorney General Pruitt's predecessor had sued the companies for damages caused by pollution and forced the companies to change disposal practices. But Mr.Pruitt in this case, rather than advocating for the judge to make a ruling, negotiated an agreement with the company to do a study on the appropriate levels of phosphorus in the Illinois  So while some might say ``Well, isn't that a good step?'' he let the agreement expire that was already in place to reduce that waste and did not seek a formal extension. He shut down the environmental unit that helped start the lawsuit against those companies. This unit was in charge of making sure that agricultural waste cleanup and millions of dollars to clean up those toxic sites were in place. Yet he let that expire.  So I have grave concerns about whether he is going to be aggressive about these issues all across the United Is he going to work to make sure these laws that are on the books already continue to be enforced? Is he going to fight to make sure that clean air and clean water--the rights of the citizens here in our country--are preserved and preserved for future generations?  I noticed that in Oklahoma there was question 777, a ballot measure. On that ballot measure was Oklahoma's right-to-farm statute that was proposed by the Oklahoma If the voters in Oklahoma approved it, it would have created an amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution prohibiting the legislature from enacting laws restricting agricultural production unless laws were needed to advance a ``compelling State interest.''  I think this is a very interesting demonstration of how people are trying to use a process, just like the House colleagues are sending over regulatory reform bills. They are going to hide behind regulatory reform when in reality they are trying to curtail clean water and clean air rules.  Well, the people of Oklahoma were a little smarter than that. Right-to-farm laws are not uncommon, and there are currently variations in all 50 But many such statutes, including Oklahoma's current law, protect farmers and ranchers from nuisance claims as long as they operate in acceptable practices.  This question that was put on the ballot to Oklahomans went further than the typical right-to-farm law; it would have amended their State constitution. The State constitution holds a higher authority than these State statutes. So if that initiative was enacted, it would have guaranteed that[[Page S1330]]agriculture can engage in farming practices without interference from the legislature, and it would even have prohibited the public from suits. Can you imagine that? I know that that is what some of the proponents of these issues want; they want to do whatever they want on the land whether it impacts the neighbors or impacts clean air or clean water. They just want to keep moving it forward.  So Mr.Pruitt was in support of question 777. He talked about the ``intrusive rules from government regulators'' that often ``fail to achieve the stated health, safety and environmental goals.'' Well, we know we want to have a balance. We can have jobs, we can have agriculture, and we can have environmental stewardship. I think we, in Washington, work very hard to achieve that.  Drought issues like we are experiencing in the Yakima Basin got everybody to the table--farmers, Native Americans, fishermen, everybody. Instead of trying to pass initiatives like this--which, by the way, failed in Oklahoma--people said: We need to work together in these challenging times of a changing climate and work on preserving what is most important to all of us. They have done a good job in doing that.  So what we are looking for is an Administrator who is going to help in that process, who is going to continue to make sure we live up to these laws that are on the books and help in the challenging times of drought and environmental impact.  Of Attorney General Pruitt's 14 cases against EPA, 13 of those suits were joined by the fossil fuel industry. The attorney general has been known to send letters to Federal agencies that basically were identical to the fossil fuel industry letters; that is, as attorney general, he wasn't making his case, he was just making the case for the fossil fuel industry.  The CEO of Continental Resources, a top oil producer in the United States--their organizations basically were trying to push Mr.Pruitt during his time as attorney general, instead of standing up for clean air and clean water. And we want to know what he is going to do in this new job--work with Members here in the Senate on continuing to implement the law.  One of the best examples of what I would expect him to do is to continue the good work of the Federal Government in protecting salmon. Of particular importance, as I mentioned earlier, is the issue of Pebble During his time as attorney general, Scott Pruitt, as I said, planned the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil That is a pretty interesting task to take if you are the attorney general of a State, the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil That summit brought together energy executives with attorneys general to strategize against what they thought was so-called EPA overreach and how to defeat it.  One of the key examples they brought up was the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to protect Bristol Bay, AK, from a proposed mine that is called Pebble Pebble Mine is a proposed large hard rock mine, as I mentioned earlier, in the headwaters of Bristol Each year nearly 40 million sockeye salmon return to Bristol In total, Bristol Bay supports 29 species of fish, including all 5 North American salmon species. That is why Bristol Bay is called one of the greatest fisheries on Bristol Bay supports a $1.5 billion sockeye salmon fishery, which provides 14,000 jobs throughout the Pacific  Even my colleague, the late Ted Stevens, was opposed to the Pebble I think he knew the great resource and the importance of Bristol  This fishery, and the people in that fishery, and the tribes of Bristol Bay, petitioned the EPA to evaluate the impact of the proposed Pebble Mine and what it could do to salmon.  In 2014, after years of research, EPA finalized a science-based assessment of the Pebble Mine called the Bristol Bay Watershed This assessment found that Pebble Mine posed a direct threat to Bristol Bay salmon.  I am not sure this is a picture of Bristol Bay salmon, but this is definitely an iconic symbol of what we are talking about here tonight, that thousands of jobs in our State rely on salmon, and the subsistence culture of many Native Americans also rely on Bristol Bay salmon. That is why so many people weighed in at meetings with EPA and agencies in various parts of the Northwest to talk about this issue, because so many jobs would be impacted. That mine would destroy up to 94 miles of salmon spawning streams, devastate up to 5,350 acres of wetlands, and create 10 billion tons of toxic mine waste.  So you can imagine my concern when the attorney general out of Oklahoma decided he was going to take a very lenient attitude on animal waste and hold the summit trying to basically figure out ways to disrupt EPA's questioning and assertions about Bristol How far he is going to go as EPA Administrator to basically have a negative impact on our salmon economy?  He could have said: It was just a session, and I support EPA's actions. But that is not the message we are receiving. The toxic mine waste that would exist at Bristol Bay would contaminate massive amounts of areas behind the second largest dam in the world, and that mine waste would be there in perpetuity in Bristol  So the science was very clear. The Pebble Mine was in the wrong place, and it was the wrong idea. Large mining companies have come to that same conclusion. Just a few weeks ago, an analyst issued a report that said Pebble Mine is ``not commercially viable.'' That is because of the tremendous costs that are associated with it and the risks associated with it.  After the EPA assessment found that salmon were at risk from the Pebble Mine, I definitely want to make sure that Bristol Bay salmon are protected forever. The EPA had the authority to basically use a section of the Clean Water Act to make sure those Bristol Bay salmon were protected. That is what I expect. That is what I expect after public hearings, an open process, using the authority. Why would it be a good idea to let a mine be located at the headwaters of one of the most important salmon runs in the world? Why would we do that? Yet Mr.Pruitt took time to join an effort to say: How can we overturn EPA's efforts here?  I need an EPA Administrator who is going to stand up for our environment in the Pacific Northwest and protect us on clean air and clean water. It is critical that those individuals who were proposing this mine continue to be thwarted.  While the EPA has been close to making sure there are permanent protections for Bristol Bay, I am very concerned that this EPA Administrator could start this process all over again. That is something we can't afford. We cannot have an EPA Administrator who is on the wrong side of the Pebble mine issue. They need to protect Northwest salmon.  I would also like to talk about another threat to our environment, to our fishing economy that is certainly happening today and why we need an EPA Administrator not to be spending their time joining forces with polluters, figuring out ways to avoid law, but figuring out ways to implement the Clean Air Act that the Supreme Court says we must follow through on.  Last year, Attorney General Pruitt stated that there is a disagreement about whether human activity has had an impact on climate. When he was pressed on this issue during his hearing, he continued to question scientific facts. He said he believed climate change is irrelevant to his role as EPA Well, I disagree. Climate change is not a future hypothetical issue. We are seeing it today, and we are seeing it in our  Our fishermen want to continue the great legacy that we have in our fishing traditions, and we are going to get to why this picture is affected by what I am going to talk about next, but we want to continue to have thriving Northwest fisheries. We want to continue to have a healthy environment and food chain that is going to allow us to have a robust fishery in the  I think our fisheries can be cited as some of the best managed fisheries in the entire world. That is how good we are at it. That is how scientific we are at it. That is how collaborative we are at it. That is how much hard work has been put into stewardship and managing the resources and making sure the jobs still exists. I would match that with any other part of the United States or this planet. The Northwest[[Page S1331]]fisheries are managed well, but they are being challenged. They are being challenged by the fact that our climate is changing and that the oceans absorb 25 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions, which resulted basically in a changing of the chemistry in our waterways. That is right; the oceans absorb 25 percent of carbon emissions. So basically they become this sink for the emissions.  We have scientists who are out on the Olympic Peninsula studying this very issue, not for us in the Northwest; they are studying it for the entire United It is part of our National Laboratory system. They are looking at this very important issue and the challenges we face from it.  The fact that the oceans have been the sinks for that carbon has made the rate of ocean acidification 10 times faster than anything we have seen on Earth in the last 50 million years. In Puget Sound, that means that ocean acidification has resulted in massive die-offs of young oysters. Juvenile shellfish cannot survive in these corrosive waters, and their shells actually dissolve.  So this economy for us is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the shellfish industry. A few years ago, we were successful in getting some very minor--I think it was in the definitely thousands of dollars--to help that industry figure out what was happening because the shells weren't forming. We were able to see that ocean acidification was having such a corrosive impact, we helped the industry figure out when a better time for seeding was and to get to a point where those extreme conditions weren't having their most devastating impact.  This die-off in 2005 caused a major plummeting of the shellfish industry. An industry that employs over 3,000 people in the State of I have met shellfish growers who are fourth-generation shellfish growers in our So this way of life around Puget Sound is important to us. You can go to probably a dozen restaurants here. I am sure you could have gone across the street to Johnny's Half Shell and ordered a product from Washington It would be one of the premier products on the menu.  We have to fight to keep this industry. We have to make smart decisions about our environment. We have to make good stewardship decisions or those four generations of shellfish growers are not going to be here anymore.  The pollution that is coming from carbon into our water is a big deal. How big a deal is it? Well, it is a big enough deal to put on the front page of the Seattle Times above the fold--and probably not just once, probably several times. Why? Because we live and have a huge population around the shores of something called Puget  Almost everyone, everyone there understands the importance of clean water and a healthy environment to protect this maritime economy and to make the right decisions moving forward.  We don't want to see what happened in 2005 and in 2006. We don't want to see that. We want to see more of our shellfish actually able to survive the seeding process, and we want to continue to be smart about this. This is where the science question comes in.  If we have an EPA Administrator who doesn't believe this impact is happening, if he is going to thwart the efforts to do the research and the science, if he is going to spend more time trying to thwart these laws than implement strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change, we are not going to be successful economically. We need technology like ocean acidification sensors.  Why were we successful at turning that situation around with the shellfish industry and making sure? It is because we were able to locate buoys in the water to give us data and information about these warming temperatures, what problems it was causing, and come up with a strategy to lessen the impact of acidification. They measured our waters and how to modify growing practices. That is basically what they did. If you are denying that climate change is even happening or that it is having this impact and you are not planning for it, you are not going to go out and help our growers strategize for the future.  They use that real-time information to increase the production from the 20 percent of historical levels that it was to 70 percent, but without that data in collaboration with places like NOAA, our shellfish industry would have continued to just decline.  I need an EPA Administrator who is going to support monitoring; that is going to understand this impact and do something about it.  Now why did I have the other picture of the salmon fisherman? Because ocean acidification, as I mentioned, basically dissolves the shells of important prey species we call pteropods, and they are the base of the food chain. So not only am I just talking about the thousands of jobs and millions of dollars associated with the shellfish industry, if you have so much carbon sinking into our waters that you are destroying this part of the food chain, it impacts the rest of the food chain. It impacts all the way up the species, including salmon, herring, mackerel, and other species. So this is why we have to have an EPA Administrator who is going to follow science and be aggressive at protecting these issues.  Last month, a new study published by scientists at the University of Washington and NOAA found that even Dungeness crabs are at risk because of these pteropods. I think that is what it says right there: ``Scientists fear ocean acidification will drive the collapse of Alaska's iconic crab fishery.'' Thank you, thank you, Seattle  That is what this is about, are we going to leave it up to the newspapers of America to describe the scientific impact of what is happening so we can force people whose job it is to be the stewards here to do their jobs?  They should be the leaders, the people we put in this position. They should be the ones who lead our Nation in protecting our most valuable natural resources and making sure these pristine areas that we need for our economy, for our quality of life, for our recreation are there, and we need an EPA Administrator who is going to be aggressive about that.  So that is a little preview of this issue and what it looks like in the State of Washington, but on this climate issue, as I mentioned, my colleague from Maine and I actually joined forces probably 6 or 7 years ago on this issue when the Senator from Maine was aggressive about pushing legislation, asking Federal agencies to make sure they had a response to climate change. I think the Senator from Maine probably saw then how important this issue was, and it was legislation we actually passed out of the Commerce I don't think it was actually implemented into law, but it was a very good directive at saying to agencies: This is going to impact us, and what is your mitigation plan.  We, in the Commerce Committee, held a hearing about this because what we were finding was that a huge part of the U.economy--it was definitely a high number, maybe as much as 50 percent--was driven by States with coastal economies. A report was issued about how all of these changes impacted sea level rising, impact in ocean acidification, all of these things were going to impact these coastal economies and thereby have a dramatic effect on the U.economy.  For example, just because it might not be front and center for somebody from Oklahoma, it was going to become very front and center for the U.economy if we didn't have a mitigation plan and did something about it, and this report was a heralding call for the United States to wake up to this issue.  I will never forget that hearing because the actress Sigourney Weaver was there to testify. She was there to testify because she really wanted to make the point about how important these issues were, as it related to our waters and the impact.  You would think a brilliant actress like Sigourney Weaver would steal the show. You would think her testimony before the Commerce Committee would be it. That would be the news of the day, and that is what would be written about, but it was actually a fisherman from a Southern coastal State who stole the show because he spoke about how his job was threatened, how fisheries were threatened, how, if we don't protect our oceans and our air, we are going to have devastating effects on our fisheries. This gentleman, whose family and livelihood was dependent[[Page S1332]]upon it, spoke in such an unbelievably meaningful way, he upstaged her.  So this isn't something we are coming at just because President Trump has nominated Scott Pruitt; this is something we are going to fight for every single day because it is important that our Nation have a response to it.  My colleague from Maine was on it a long time ago. She said: Let's make sure that every agency is going to have a plan for what we are going to do about mitigation and impact as a result of climate.  As I mentioned just recently, in the last year or so, she and I joined and sent a letter to GAO asking them to actually give us an estimate across the whole Federal What is going to be the cost and impact of these changes to climate on our economy and the Federal Government? This is a very important answer to have from the GAO because my guess is that they are going to show that it costs a lot of money. It is not surprising to me because I have seen it in my own State, with catastrophic wildfires that have burned up hundreds of thousands of acres of land at an unbelievable cost to the Federal  We are trying to come up with a better strategy for combatting these wildfires. We can't get our House colleagues to engage in a serious Energy bill process. Hopefully someday we will get them to understand that the Senate in a bipartisan fashion did its homework and had approval.  But these issues are not going away. Next summer there will be another part of the United States that will be in the hot spot again, and instead of making sure we are addressing that, some of our colleagues just want to ignore it, just like they are ignoring Mr.Pruitt's emails and his answers to these important questions.  That is the Let's look at other parts of the country on ocean acidification. Here is an example of a coral reef in the State of In 2016, the University of Miami published a study which found that Biscayne Bay coral reefs are already suffering the impacts of ocean acidification. I would expect that coral reefs in Florida are probably as important to their economy as salmon is to our economy. I say that because I know people go to visit those coral reefs. Actually, their reefs, according to economic analysis, are worth over $7.6 billion. That is what coral reefs are worth, apparently, due to their importance in recreational and commercial fisheries and tourism.  Everybody wants to stand up for the fossil fuel industry because they have jobs, but they forget the jobs that are related because of our environment and how important it is to our economy.  In this particular picture, we are seeing the devastating impact and changes of this coral reef in just a very short period of time.  This upper picture taken in 1976 shows a very vibrant coral reef. I think this is an area where there has been a lot of discussion. I am not exactly sure where Carysfort Reef is, but I think there has been a lot of discussion here in the Senate about making sure people have access to it or what ways the public can enjoy this particular site. But when I look at this picture and I look at the devastating impact we see on this coral reef, I question what our strategy is to preserve what is an important recreational and commercial asset to What is our strategy?  When I think about an EPA Administrator, are they going to act now in balancing this issue and making sure that things like the Clean Power Plan, which is saying to polluters: You must reduce pollution--are they going to do that for the fishermen and recreationists and those who believe in the beauty of these coral reefs in Florida? Just like the Washingtonians in my State who go out and recreate on Puget Sound and want to fish salmon and want to make sure our fishing economy stays strong--are they going to have an Administrator who is going to do this?  I can tell you that next summer I guarantee you there are going to be unbelievable discussions about fishing in the Why? Because there is going to be an impact on salmon, and everybody is going to want to fish--commercial fishermen, sports fishermen--everybody is going to want to fish, and unless we have an EPA Administrator and a NOAA Administrator and people who are implementing great conservation strategies, we are not going to be successful because this pollution is impacting our natural areas.  I can see here that it is impacting Florida's economy the same way.  During an interview, Scott Pruitt's predecessor, former Attorney General Drew Edmondson, who served as Oklahoma attorney general from 1995 to 2001, stated:       ``Under his tenure as attorney general, I don't think      environmental crimes have disappeared. It is just the filing      of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely      disappeared.''  So I think that somebody knows something about this.  I have constituents who are also writing and communicating to me about these issues, about whether they think Mr.Pruitt is the right person to be EPA It is not surprising that we have a quote here from one of my constituents from Poulsbo, I just talked about the Puget Sound economy. I just talked about this economy. Puget Sound is town after town of communities with fishermen who go out and take advantage of that economy within our waters and also go as far away as Alaska to fish. So I am not surprised that somebody from Kitsap County has written to the Kitsap Sun and said: ``I voted for Trump, but I certainly did not vote for a government takedown of my State's most important asset, our water and our economy.''  It doesn't surprise me that that is what somebody in Kitsap County said--not somebody in You should just go look it up, people who are listening. People listening, anybody listening tonight from other parts of the United States, go look up Poulsbo, It is a beautiful community that is all about what Puget Sound can deliver for us, and they will be the first part of our State to tell you what ocean acidification is doing in Hood Canal to impact our fishermen. They will be the first people. They know because this has been part of their livelihood.  So I want to close tonight--this morning, I should say--by saying that I hope our colleagues will at least consider the fact that we are raising concerns, because we have great concerns about the economy of the future, and that economy of the future depends on clean air and clean water and an Administrator who is going to fight to implement the law.  We need an Administrator who is going to be there not on the side of the polluters but on the side of the people in dealing with some of the thorniest environmental problems because of the change in climate this country has seen. We want someone who is going to use that science and information to help provide the stewardship for future generations. I don't think that is Mr. I ask my colleagues to help turn down his nomination and to move forward--at least give us the chance to look at his emails so we know exactly what we are dealing with and to make sure that our country is going to continue to be committed to these men and women who work in this resource economy that depends so much on clean water and air.

1697,topic-id,3494,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the nomination of Congressman Ryan Zinke to be Secretary of the  The Secretary of the Interior is one of the most important jobs in the Federal Government and even more so for people in the I know the Presiding Officer would agree with that.  The Department of the Interior has an incredibly broad portfolio. It is responsible for managing our Nation's public lands, our national parks, our national wildlife refuges, and overseeing mineral and energy development on our public lands and in our Federal waters offshore, making sure that the taxpayers of the United States get a fair deal for the resources that the public--the public--actually owns. The responsibilities of the Department of the Interior also include ensuring that tribal trust responsibilities are met, as well as attending to our insular affairs. The Secretary of the Interior also manages a large part of water resources in Western States--again, which I know the Presiding Officer knows so well because there are so many issues related to drinking water and hydroelectric facilities that affect millions of our citizens.  So it is a far-reaching and diverse portfolio, and it requires the Secretary[[Page S1459]]to take into account not only the demands of the extraction industry--the oil, gas, coal, and hard rock mining companies--the Secretary, above all, must protect the public's interests.  I think the public could probably best understand this by knowing what happened in the Gulf of Mexico and the implosion that happened with the Deepwater Horizon well. Here, the Department of the Interior and minerals management resource agencies, in my opinion, should have been doing a better job of protecting the public and protecting that vital resource.  The conclusion of hearings after this fact found that there were many recommendations to clean up and streamline the minerals management agency so that it was not catering to the interests of the oil and gas industry, but making sure that it adheres to what is the public interest. Now all that has been made famous in a movie, which many of the public I think should go to see. Taking shortcuts when it comes to extraction of mineral resources is not a good idea, and having an Interior Secretary who makes sure we manage these resources well is critical to our  Also, the outdoor recreation industry, in and of itself, in my opinion--and I am sure in the opinion of many others here who understand it--has become a juggernaut. I will talk about that in a little bit. It is an economy in and of itself. It is worth preserving. It is worth fighting for. It is a source of tax revenue, income, jobs, and, most importantly, a quality of life that so many Americans hold dear. I have been so touched by the letters I have gotten from veterans, who have said to me on their returning back from Iraq and Afghanistan that having the wonders of the outdoors as a place for peace and sanctuary has been so critical to them. They have argued in support of important programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and others, to make sure that our public lands are there for them to enjoy and for their children to enjoy in the future.  So, in short, the Secretary must balance the short-term demands of developing resources on these public lands against the need to protect the environment and sensitive areas and preserve that natural heritage, as I said, for future generations. It is very important that we have a Secretary who understands what our Nation's leading stewardship responsibilities are, understands what those special places are, like the Grand Canyon, and other places such as Mount Rainier, and makes sure they are protected.  I had hoped to be able to support Congressman Zinke's nomination based on his assurances that he would manage the Department of the Interior as a Teddy Roosevelt However, I cannot ignore the Trump administration's plans for our public lands and resources, and I cannot ignore Congressman Zinke's commitment during our committee hearings to work to implement President-Elect Trump's energy independence policy, as well as a variety of positions on returning Federal land, taking public lands off the protection that they deserve today. These are very important public policy issues, and I note that President Trump has said to many people: ``My Cabinet is free to say whatever they want.'' So the fact that these important policies are going to be implemented that may erode what has been decades of policy for us in managing our public resources is quite concerning to me.  What exactly is the Trump administration's plan? Clearly, the Trump administration intends to pursue an aggressive agenda when it comes to mining and drilling on our public lands and waters. The President and his senior advisers have made clear their intention to undo what are reasonable protections put in place in environmentally sensitive areas. The administration will renew its efforts to reverse protections of important onshore and offshore areas. Based on energy plans posted on the White House website immediately after the President's inauguration, the President seems to be committed to simply opening up as much Federal land as possible to coal mining and energy development.  The administration has said it will use money from drilling and mining on all our public lands and waters to pay for a multibillion-dollar infrastructure package. My constituents want to know where they draw the line. Where does that stop?  The administration has already suspended rules ensuring polluters on our public lands don't have to pay their fair share. The President has signed into law a measure gutting the Obama administration rule that would have prevented coal companies from dumping toxic chemicals into our Nation's rivers and streams. So it is clear to me that the new administration will do everything it can to reverse the responsible management of our public land and instead pursue an aggressive energy development policy without regard to the environmental and public health consequences.  The bedrock principle, I believe, is that polluters should pay and they should clean up their messes on public lands. We may all have a different opinion here about how much public land should be developed, but I think everybody should be in agreement that polluters should pay, and they should leave our public land in a pristine nature.  It is equally clear that the new administration will be encouraged in this effort by the majorities in the House and the Senate by some of the legislation we have already seen, such as enabling coal companies to dump their mining waste into streams and impacting State drinking water, enabling oil companies to waste the public's natural resource without paying royalties on the gas they waste--that is costing taxpayers money--and reports that the President intends to issue an Executive order to overturn the current moratorium prohibiting new coal leases on Federal land. That is an issue about getting a fair deal for the taxpayer. The taxpayer is impacted by this coal extraction. Coal companies, instead of doing the job it takes to extract coal without an impact on the public, are taking Federal resources and making lots of money without responsibility to the taxpayer.  The previous Secretary, Secretary Jewell, basically said, for the first time in many years, that they would look at what the industry was paying as far as coal royalties. That process is underway, and we think it should be carried out. We think the taxpayer deserves a fair deal.  Unfortunately, I am not convinced that Congressman Zinke will be willing or able to moderate the Trump administration's extreme views on exploiting our public lands, and I am not sure he will be willing or able to stand up to the President to protect the public interest and ensure that our public lands are managed and protected for the benefit of all Americans--not just the oil, gas, and mining companies and their commercial interests.  The Secretary's principal job is to be a guardian, a steward of our public lands. To me, stewardship is so important. So many of my colleagues come to the floor and act like they are managing this resource for their lifetime and their generation. Stewardship is about managing these resources for future generations as well. If our past ancestors had been so callus with these Federal resources, where would we be today? It is so important that we not look at these Federal lands so narrowly as a source of natural resources that someone has in their particular State or interest but also to make sure that stewardship protects these resources for future generations as well. With that in mind, I have seen several laws and regulations under attack that are fundamental to keeping that mission of stewardship at the Department of the Interior, including the Clean Water Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the Clean Air Act, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, and the Antiquities  While Congressman Zinke said he would oppose the transfer of Federal lands to the States, which I appreciate, at the same time, he has indicated he is willing to consider transferring away management of certain Federal lands to the  What does that mean? For example, you could have a monument or a designation of Federal land--it could be even Mount Rainier or some beautiful place in the Pacific Northwest--consequently transferred back to the State and that particular State--it wouldn't happen in Washington but might happen in some other State--decides to start managing that land and extracting resources. You might think that[[Page S1460]]couldn't possibly happen. I have news for you. That is the debate du jour. This is exactly--exactly--the debate today.  Last Congress, Congressman Zinke cosponsored and voted for a bill to transfer to the States management of red snapper fisheries in Federal waters. He supports transferring Federal management responsibilities to the States, and it clearly undercuts the commitment to Federal resources.  We also know he has previously supported efforts to restrict use of the Antiquities Act to designate national monuments. In fact, he appears open to efforts to weaken or repeal certain recently designated national monuments. He has indicated one of his first priorities, upon confirmation, will be to visit Utah to consider a Republican proposal to rescind the recently designated Bears Ears National This is despite the strong support of many across the Nation and in Utah, as well as tribal support from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, representing the five affected tribes in the region.  As somebody who enjoys the outdoors, I can state how important it is to be able to go and recreate. I have not been to Bears Ears, but I have heard incredible stories from climbers and those interested in seeing this unique terrain that it is a very special place.  As we enter this debate, the issue of the Bears Ears National Monument and whether they are going to roll back Federal land protection will be at the center of this discussion. Created by President Obama, Bears Ears encompasses 1.3 million acres of beautiful desert hills, mesas, sandstone canyons, spiritually significant lands to local tribes, and some of the best crack climbing in the world. The climbing community loves to recreate there.  The conservation community and tribes have fought for many years for this designation. If and when he is confirmed, Congressman Zinke will be under intense pressure from some quarters to try to undo this designation. In fact, heated debate on this subject boiled over just a week ago as the Outdoor Retailer show decided to leave Salt Lake City, after two decades and contributing at least $40 million to the economy in various shows that they had each year there, because of Utah's stated desire and the congressional delegation's interest in basically claiming Federal lands and selling them off for extraction from the oil and gas industry.  I was so proud of retailers, such as REI in my State or others such as Patagonia, Black Diamond, Outdoor Research and others, basically put their money where their mouth is. They decided that if a State was going to attack the very economy that was so important to them in jobs and recreation, that they were going to do something about moving their impacted industry somewhere else.  I would like to read what the Salt Lake Tribune editorial board had to say about this issue.  ``In the same week Utah announced that it had topped $8.17 billion in annual economic benefit from tourism, the $40 million Outdoor Retailer show announced it was leaving.  ``Surely we can take a half-percent hit, right?  ``The exit of Outdoor Retailer is so much more than just losing the State's largest convention. There will be hospitality jobs lost, and hotel rooms from Sandy to Ogden vacant for those two weeks a year. We're now building a 900-room downtown convention hotel--with public bonding authority--largely on spec. There is now no convention currently on Salt Lake City's docket that demands it.  ``The reason Outdoor Retailer is leaving--their rejection of Utah's political leaders' values as shown in the stubborn and pointless fight against a Bears Ears National Monument--should make this moment a turning point.  ``In the 1960s, Utah found itself at a confluence.

There will be      hospitality jobs lost, and hotel rooms from Sandy to Ogden      vacant for those two weeks a year. We're now building a 900-     room downtown convention hotel--with public bonding      authority--largely on spec. There is now no convention      currently on Salt Lake City's docket that demands it.

1698,topic-id,1189,"Mr.President, I think that editorial puts this debate squarely in front of my colleagues. We have a nominee who has been all over the map as it relates to public lands, and, certainly, he has been on record that he will implement the President's strategy. I know he plans to visit this area, and I am so concerned that it will be the first of many areas in which people run over the larger public and national interests in order to preserve special places just for immediate extraction when, in reality, the jobs from the outdoor economy are just as important and, if you add up numbers, may be more important economically in both the near term and the long term.  I should also note that those of us in Washington would gladly welcome the outdoor retailers with open arms. I am sure they will consider many different places, but we understand that protecting our most treasured places not only preserves them for this generation but for future generations, and it helps drive an economy.  In Utah, outdoor recreation is responsible for $12 billion in consumer spending--more than twice the value of oil and gas produced in that If we are talking about top dog economics, the outdoor industry wins. In Washington State, the outdoor economy supports 227,000 direct-paying jobs and wages of $7.1 billion. Nationwide, it is 6.1 million jobs and $646 billion in revenues from outdoor recreation, so this is a very valued part of the U.economy. It is also a very valued part of the American spirit.  Not only do the Bears Ears National Monument and others like it benefit county, State, and Federal coffers, but they also offer access to our shared heritage. As I said, it is that spiritual connection to nature that is so valuable to all of us, but I hold so dear that our veterans cherish it so much too. They deserve the relief of being able to go to our greatest and beautiful places and have some solace.  A second major responsibility of the Secretary is to manage the mineral resources that are on public lands and waters. One of the fundamental principles of the public resource management is that the American people should receive a fair market value for the energy and minerals that are extracted from our public lands. These resources are owned by every  I think, sometimes, people get confused that these are the rights of these industries, that they own them. We have allowed that extraction and the leasing of that extraction, but we need to make sure that the taxpayers' interests and the costs of impact are well represented and that extraction is done in an efficient manner--that it protects the resources for the future, that it cleans up its mess, and that polluters pay.  An important principle is that our public lands be managed so that their use will not permanently harm the land or the environment and that, in allowing companies to mine on public land, they must minimize the harm they do, clean up the messes they make, and repair and pay for the damage. ``Polluter pays'' should be a basic principle.  The Secretary of the Interior must be committed to preserving and enforcing those important principles and to making sure that the taxpayers get a fair deal. The previous Secretary, as I said--Secretary Jewell--took important steps to advance those principles. On her watch, the Department issued its new stream protection rule, its methane venting and flaring rule, its mineral valuation rule, and the comprehensive examination of its coal leasing program.  Most of these initiatives involve updating existing policies that have been in place for 20 or 30 years. That is just another way of saying that whether the taxpayer is getting a fair deal by allowing these companies to mine these Federal resources has not really been evaluated for 20 or 30 years, so I am sure my colleagues could understand that that kind of updating should take place. During these three intervening decades, technology has improved and science has advanced, and we need to make sure technology recognizes that, when pollution happens, it needs to be cleaned up.  Attacks on Secretary Jewell's public health and taxpayer initiatives are already underway, and I am concerned that Congressman Zinke will not stand up to make sure that the policies of ``polluter pays'' are followed and that the good work that has already been established is continued. At his confirmation hearing, Congressman Zinke stated that the war on coal is real and that he supports lifting the coal leasing moratorium. This is completely contrary to the rational view of energy market dynamics, and it is at odds with the energy policies our constituents expect.  While Federal coal leasing is an issue of national concern, it is also critically important in my They want to make sure that taxpayers get a fair deal for the leasing of that land. As people have discussed here on the floor, the advent of natural gas and its cheap value has done more to drive down the use of coal than any of this discussion about whether taxpayers are getting a fair deal.  Finally, the Secretary of the Interior must be committed to upholding our trust and treaty obligations for our country's 567 federally recognized tribes. That Secretary must be committed to recognizing tribal sovereignty and self-determination, protecting tribal lands and waters and mineral resources, and supporting adequate resources for tribal education, social services, and infrastructure.  Congressman Zinke has been a strong advocate of the Crow Tribes' coal resource in his home State; and while I respect his responsibility to his district, he will be required as Secretary of the Interior to have a much different position in representing all tribes across the United  I know that some of my colleagues think that one can be expedient on any[[Page S1462]]of these issues whether it is on the Antiquities Act or on coal leasing or on making sure that we live up to tribal sovereignty. In reality, it takes very little to sign an Executive order; it takes a lot to overrule the law of the land. Many of these issues will end up in court, and many of them will be battled for several years. I would suggest to my colleagues that we find a common interest in preserving our stewardship, in preserving our natural resources, and in continuing to develop this kind of economy moving forward.  I am not convinced that Congressman Zinke is going to show the leadership on these resources that is necessary, given his very different views on public lands as a Congressman--on all sides of the issue. We need someone who is going to stand up, just like those in Utah did, and say that the outdoor economy is worth it. The designation of public lands, as done by the President of the United States, should be preserved, and we should continue to fight for something that is providing so many jobs and such a great connection for so many  I yield the floor.

945,topic-id,1166,"Mr.President, I am here to address an issue that I think is of great importance to this country and to this administration; that is, the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the new EPA  We are nearly 8 years removed now from what we consider--many of us, I think, particularly as we look back--the great recession. However, many American workers, their families, and their communities have yet to feel the benefits of any kind of a recovery. A key component to a slow recovery--the[[Page S1235]]slowest recovery since World War I--is the regulatory overreach coming out of this city--Washington,  Since the end of the recession in June 2009, Federal agencies have burdened a weakened economy with thousands of pages of new rules, costing consumers billions of dollars. Tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs. The EPA has perhaps become the poster child for this overreach, from restricting carbon emissions without the direction of Congress--and according to the clean air direction of Congress of what is important--to federalizing every stream, every pond, every wetland under the waters of the United States rule, to unilaterally banning virtually Appalachian coal mining by obstructing the permitting process and pursuing ozone standards that the vast majority of the country cannot meet. The vast majority of the country is still trying to meet the ozone standards that were established under the last regulation.  I support the mission of the EPA in protecting human health, in protecting our air and our water, but there has to be a balance. There has to be a balance between growing the economy and preserving the environment. Over the last several years, we have seen that balance very disrupted. This disruption is at odds with the law and the well-being of many of our working families.  This has been acutely felt in my State of West Virginia where we have lost more than 35 percent of our coal jobs since the year 2011. That is more than 7,000 jobs eliminated in a relatively small State like West Virginia, and many of these jobs are very high-paying jobs.  As a nation, we have lost more than 60,000 coal miners in the same timeframe. This has hurt our workers, our families, our communities, and our  The loss of good-paying jobs means less commercial activity. It means less tax revenue to support our education, our county school systems, our county ambulances, our county sheriff's departments, and our law enforcement. For example, little old Wayne County in West Virginia has lost 88 percent of its coal severance taxes between 2013 and 2016. This year, our Governor and our legislature are struggling right now with a $500 million budget deficit, largely due to the loss of our coal jobs.  Patching that shortfall could mean significant tax increases, painful cuts in public services, or both, which could further hurt and cripple our local economy. It will be a long road undoing the legal and economic damages suffered over the last several years.  Voters in my State and across the country have made it clear that fixing Washington includes meaningful reforms for the way that the EPA operates and has been operating.  So what do we have before us? We have a great nominee for EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is presently the attorney general of another energy-producing State--Scott is committed to returning the Agency to its core mission of protecting our air, our water, and our land without undercutting the economy. At least, we know that he will listen to the other side and try to be reasonable.  He will ensure that the EPA abides by congressional intent, and he will be an active partner with State and local stakeholders in the rulemaking process.  Going back to the stream buffer rule and the reason that fell apart--and I am so pleased that the President is going to be signing the CRA on that today--the EPA invited States to come in and speak about the rulemaking process. Within months, it became very apparent to the States that are charged with protecting the water that this is just window dressing. They realized: They are not listening to us, and they don't really want us to buy in. Eight of those States left.  So as the attorney general for the State of Oklahoma, he has held industry to account as well protected lakes and streams in his I asked him in the committee: If the State or local government doesn't intervene in what looks to be an environmental issue--not just a crisis, but if they are not doing their job in protecting the air and the water--what would you do as the EPA Administrator? He said: That is where we should be stepping in. That is where we should be helping those States meet those standards, helping those States get the right information.  So I think he is going to be unafraid to take on the EPA when it is set to ignore a State's sovereignty.  Mr.Pruitt is the most thoroughly vetted candidate for this position in history. He fielded 6 hours' worth of questioning before the Committee on Environment and Public Works, where I serve. During that hearing, he assured me that he will engage directly with the State of West Virginia and visit our We could never get the EPA Administrator to visit our State and listen to our side. He will visit our State, listen to our side, and reform the rulemaking process to prevent another open assault on our economy by unelected bureaucrats.  He also committed to me that he would pursue full implementation of the bipartisan Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, a bill on which we joined together--Republicans and Democrats, both sides of the aisle, with President Obama--to modernize our toxic chemical regulations in terms of water.  This is important to me. I was talking to my colleague from Michigan about this issue. We had a water crisis in West Virginia where we had a large chemical spill. This bill, under Scott Pruitt's leadership and my pressing for the implementation, as others will be, will help us in situations like this.  Beyond the over 200 questions he answered in the hearing, he answered more than 1,000 followup questions. He is the most thoroughly vetted nominee for Administrator in the history of the I am confident--very confident--as he assured me in committee and in personal meetings, and I have watched him in action in terms of questioning the overreach in the court systems. He has worked with our attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, to be the leader in this.  I have confidence that he embodies the leadership that we need to restore the balance and accountability to the EPA in a way that will benefit the public health and benefit environmental preservation, as well as restore much-needed economic growth that needs to be a part of the balance that we want to see restored back to the  With that, I yield the floor.

935,topic-id,1324,"Mr.President, I oppose the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney to serve as Director of the Office of Management & Budget, Representative Mulvaney's radical views regarding the fundamental role of government in our society make him philosophically ill-suited to run I will list a number of those views.  Social Security--In May 2009, Representative Mulvaney was a member of the South Carolina State Senate and voted to declare that Social Security is unconstitutional. He also wants to raise the retirement age to 70. Raising the retirement age to 70 would cut earned benefits by nearly 20 percent for all beneficiaries. With all the challenges people have saving for retirement, the last thing we should do is raise the Social Security retirement age.  Medicare--Representative Mulvaney is on record advocating enormous cuts to Medicare and is a proponent of Speaker Ryan's preferred ``premium support,'' i.e., voucher, concept for ``Premium support'' is a euphemism for privatizing Representative Mulvaney said on Fox News, in April, 2011. ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' And he indicated that he wants to raise the eligibility age to 67.  Medicare guarantees comprehensive health insurance coverage for almost 50 million Only 2 percent of elderly Americans are uninsured; nearly 50 percent were before Medicare was signed into law.  Debt ceiling--Representative Mulvaney appears willing to jeopardize the full faith and credit of the U.He claims that breeching the debt ceiling would not automatically trigger a default on Treasury debt; he calls such concern ``a fabricated crisis.'' Representative Mulvaney believes the Treasury would be able to ``prioritize'' payments and avoid a default.  His ``pay China first'' policy is contrary to the opinion of several recent Treasury Secretaries, would be impossible to execute from a logistical standpoint, and is based on a 1985 Government Accountability Office report the agency has since walked away from. The Treasury Department lacks legal authority to establish ``priorities'' with respect to paying the Nation's obligations. Each law obligating funds and authorizing expenditures stands on an equal footing, so the Department has to make payments on obligations as they come due.  Debt limit brinksmanship is expensive. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the 10-year cost to taxpayers of the 2011 debt limit standoff was $18.9 billion because of the increased interest rates on U.securities issued in 2011. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded the long-term credit rating of the U.government for the first time in history, from AAA to AA+.  Government shutdowns--Representative Mulvaney believes that shutting[[Page S1228]]down the Federal Government is an acceptable way to do business. He stated on CNN that shutting down the government over funding the Affordable Care Act was ``worth it'' in October 2013 and embraces the term ``shutdown caucus.'' In a September 2015 Atlantic article, he argued that shutting down the government is important becauset it is what ``the base of the (Republican) party wants.''  Standard & Poor's determined that the October 2013 government shutdown cost $24 billion.  Federal workers--Representative Mulvaney has sponsored numerous bills attacking the Federal workforce, including many that freeze Federal workers' pay. Federal workers have already ``contributed'' over $180 billion to deficit reduction through pay freezes and other measures. He has sponsored the Federal Workforce Reduction Through Attrition Act, the most recent version of which caps the Federal workforce at 90 percent of its current level. A previous version would have mandated that ``agencies do not appoint'' for 3 years ``more than one employee for every three employees retiring or otherwise separating from government service.''  Women's reproductive health--in September 2015, Representative Mulvaney spearheaded a letter signed by 38 House Republicans--all men--opposing any legislation to fund the government that also continues to fund Planned In an August 2015 email to the Washington Post, Representative Mulvaney wrote that, if the Congress were to shut down the Federal Government over Planned Parenthood funding, ``so be it.''  Science and climate change--in a Facebook post from last September, quoted in Vox, Representative Mulvaney questioned the need for government funded research ``at all'' in the context of doubting the scientific consensus that the Zika virus causes microcephaly.  Representative Mulvaney disputes the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. During the Budget Committee's nomination hearing, when Senator Kaine asked Representative Mulvaney about human-caused climate change, Representative Mulvaney replied, ``I challenge the premise of your fact.''  The Union of Concerned Scientists opposes Representative Mulvaney's nomination, writing:       He has backed legislation to change the regulatory process      in ways that would give an even stronger influence to      industry, increase political interference and undermine      science-based decision-making .  .  . Too often, the voices      of people who will be hurt the most by rolling back science-     based safeguards are drowned out by industries. The next OMB      director needs to enact science-based laws in a timely      manner, with a focus on ensuring benefits for all  Not surprisingly, Koch Industries has been a primary donor to Representative Mulvaney's campaigns and his  Regulations--Representative Mulvaney's voting record has been hostile to regulatory efforts to improve health, safety, and consumer protections. This is especially alarming because as OMB Director, Representative Mulvaney will oversee the Office of Information and Regulatory Representative Mulvaney has voted to curtail regulations regarding debit cards, medical devices, public swimming pools, excessive executive compensation, consumer financial protection, energy exploration, investment advisers, mortgage lenders, and so on.  House Republican budget plans--the last time House Republicans brought a full budget resolution to the House floor, Representative Mulvaney voted against it because it wasn't extreme enough. He supported the Republican Study Committee, RSC, budget instead. Provisions of the most recent version of the RSC budget include: 1, a 10-year $261 billion cut to Social Security by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, COLAs, increasing the retirement age to 70, and ``increasing means-testing''; 2, $662 billion in cuts to Medicare by changing the program into a ``premium support'' model, i.e., ``voucher-izing,'' increasing the eligibility age, and phasing in means-testing; 3, $1.6 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, which would be combined into one block grant program; 4, $925 billion in savings by repealing the Affordable Care Act exchanges; and 5, $2.2 trillion in cuts to undefined ``other mandatory'' spending. Notably, the budget would not raise one dime in new revenue from the Nation's wealthiest individuals and largest corporations.  ``Nannygate''--Representative Mulvaney failed to pay FICA and Federal and State unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years 2000 to 2004. Representative Mulvaney admitted that the nanny in question worked full time--40 hours a week--for 4 to 5 years.  Representative Mulvaney said that he didn't believe he owed payroll and unemployment insurance taxes on his nanny because ``she simply helped [my wife] with the children. We considered her a babysitter.'' This is despite the fact that, as the owner of several small businesses, he knew to pay these taxes for his other full-time employees.  As a State Senator in South Carolina, Representative Mulvaney sponsored the following three bills: 1, to prohibit candidates from the ballot for the State legislature if they had not paid all Federal and State income taxes over the past 10 years; 2, to prohibit candidates from the ballot for State office if they had not paid all Federal and State income taxes over the past 10 years; and 3, to prohibit the governor from appointing anyone who had not paid all Federal and State income taxes over the past 10 years.  Representative Mulvaney voted for H.1563, Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act of 2015, which authorizes ``the head of an agency to take personnel actions against an agency employee who willfully failed to file a required tax return or willfully understated federal tax liability.'' It is worth noting here that Federal workers have a lower percentage of tax noncompliance than the general public--a 3.1 percent delinquency rate versus 8.7 percent. And Representative Mulvaney sponsored the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, which would have made people with ``seriously delinquent tax debts'' ineligible for Federal employment.  Representative Mulvaney is the wrong choice to run the OMB,  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1226-3.txt,,MUSLIM AND REFUGEE BAN,2017.0,16.0,February
981,topic-id,2437,"Mr.President, I take this time to explain to my colleagues why I will be opposing the nomination of Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection  I first want to start by saying I had an opportunity to visit with Attorney General He is a person who wants to serve our country, and we very much appreciate that. He has a distinguished career in public service, and we appreciate his willingness to continue to serve at the national level.  My reason for opposing his nomination is that he has opposed most of the missions of the Environmental Protection Agency as the attorney general of He has filed numerous lawsuits that would compromise the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to protect our environment.  I come to this debate acknowledging that there are national responsibilities to protect our environment. The United States must also be engaged in global leadership as it relates to our environment. The people of Maryland want clean air. The people of Maryland want clean water. No State can guarantee to its citizens that its air will be clean or that its water will be safe. These issues go well beyond State boundaries. They go beyond national boundaries. It is for that reason that we need an Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who will lead our Nation both in the appropriate controls and regulations to protect our air and water but also work for our country in regard to the global efforts to protect our environment for future generations.  Let me talk about the issue of climate change. Climate change is one of the greatest threats of our times. We know that this year, according to NASA--they looked at the temperature rise in 2016 and found it to be the hottest year ever recorded. We know something is happening in regard to global climate change. It is affecting so many different areas. We have eroding shorelines that our constituents see. We have major military installations located along our coast that are at risk as a result of rising sea levels from ice melt. We have populations that are at risk in the United  Let me give one example, if I might. Smith Island, MD, is a very proud community. It is a community that historically has been one of the strongest in regard to watermen and dealing with the fruits of the Chesapeake It is a proud community, and it is in danger of disappearing because we have sea level rises resulting from ice melting from climate change. We know there is a problem developing that we need to deal with. It is affecting our economy.  In my State of Maryland, the seafood industry is concerned about the future of the blue crab crop. They know that juvenile crabs need sea grass in order to be able to be protected and mature into full-blown blue crabs. With water becoming warmer, the future of sea grass is challenged, putting the blue crab at risk.  That is just one example. There are many more examples I can give about how it is affecting the economy of my It is affecting our ability to enjoy our environment, the recreation itself, and it is certainly providing a real risk in regard to the real estate. We have some very nice real estate located right on the coast or on barrier islands that is at risk of being lost as a result of climate change. We see more and more major weather events occur on a much more regular basis, causing billions of dollars of damage and putting lives at risk.  We know climate change is here. It is happening. The science is pretty clear. When we asked Attorney General Pruitt his view about the science of climate change, his answer was ``far from settled.''  The science is well understood. What we do here on Earth--the release of carbon emissions--is causing an abnormal warming of our climate. There are activities that we can do to reduce that effect on our climate. We know that. That is what science tells us. We know we can affect the adverse impacts of climate change if we take action. That is what scientists are telling us.  The world came together on this issue in I was proud to head a delegation of 10 Members of the U.Senate as we went to Paris to make it clear to the international community that the United States wanted to be part of a global solution to climate change. Not any one country can reverse the trendline that we are on that is catastrophic; we need all nations to do everything they can to reduce the impact of climate change by reducing their carbon and greenhouse emissions. That is what the global community needs to do, but we have been unable to get the global community for all countries to live up to their responsibilities.  Under President Obama and our leadership, we were able to get the world community--over 190 nations--to come together in Paris, in COP21, for every nation to take responsibility to reduce their carbon emissions so that we all can benefit from that effort.  I am concerned as to whether Mr.Pruitt, if confirmed as the EPA Administrator, will continue that U.leadership. He has not been at all committed to U.programs on dealing with climate change, let alone our international responsibilities to lead other countries to do what they need to do. I will give one example. Part of our way of showing the international community that we are serious about the climate issue was the powerplant rule issued under the Obama administration. Attorney General Pruitt joined a group in opposing that powerplant rule through filing suit against the implementation of that particular law.  We need someone who is going to lead on this effort in America and understand that we have responsibilities to lead the international community. We are at great risk from the impact of climate change, and that needs to be understood and recognized by the leader of the Environmental Protection I am not convinced Attorney General Pruitt would do that.  I want to talk a little bit about clean air. Maryland has taken pretty aggressive steps to improve the air quality from emissions within the geographical boundary of the State of That is what every State should do. But here is the challenge: Maryland is downwind from many other States' emissions, so we are seeing days in which our air quality is below what it should be, not because we haven't taken action but because we don't have a national policy to protect our clean air.  The health of Marylanders depends on the Federal Government being aggressive in guaranteeing that all citizens of this country--that steps are taken to protect the air they breathe. I can tell you the number of children who have asthma who suffer when the air quality is not what it should be. It is not only wrong from the point of[[Page S1257]]view that we have an obligation to our children to make sure we give them the healthiest air to breathe, it is also costing our economy because every day that child stays home, a parent cannot go to work. The child loses their time in school; they are being disadvantaged. If they have to take a day off from summer camp, the parent has to stay home, and it is wasting resources in this country.  For many reasons, we need an Administrator of the EPA who is committed to a national effort to make sure the air we breathe is clean and healthy.  Likewise with clean water. Some of us remember when the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969. We know that pollution was so bad, you literally could set our rivers afire. We took steps. And it was not partisan--Democrats and Republicans came together with the Clean Water We recognized that the Federal Government has the responsibility to protect the quality of our water so that we have safe, clean water in  I think we have been working to improve the Clean Water Act consistently on a nonpartisan basis, but now we have Supreme Court decisions that challenge what water the Federal Government can regulate. Congress has not taken steps to clarify that. The administration took efforts to try to clarify that under the waters of the United States, only to see a Court action to put that on hold in which Mr.Pruitt joined as the attorney general of Oklahoma, once again slowing down our effort to protect the clean waters of  I have spoken numerous times on the floor of the Congress about the Chesapeake Bay and how proud I am to be a Senator from Maryland, one of the six States that are in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, along with the District of  We know that the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. It has been so designated by many Presidents of the United It is the latest estuary in our hemisphere. The watershed contains 64,000 square miles, has over 11,000 miles of shoreline, and 17 million people live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed--150 major rivers, $1 trillion to our economy. It is part of the heritage of my State and our region. We are proud that it is part of our life. It is part of why people like to live in this region. They know the Chesapeake Bay makes their life so much more enriched and so much more valuable.  The Chesapeake Bay is in trouble. I could talk about it from a technical point of view. It doesn't flush itself as quickly as other water bodies. The historic oyster population is not what it has been. We have to, therefore, make special efforts to clean up the Chesapeake Over 30 years ago, almost 40 years now, while I was in the State legislature, when I was speaker of the house, I worked with Governor Harry Hughes, and we developed a State program to deal with the Chesapeake  We did it the right way. We started at the local levels. We got all the stakeholders together: the farmers, the developers, the local governments, the private sector, our local governments, the State government. We worked with Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is where the Susquehanna River flows, and that produces most of the fresh water that goes into the Chesapeake We worked with Delaware, Virginia, New York, and West Virginia, and we developed the Chesapeake Bay Program that is worked from the local level up. We get together to determine what is reasonable: What does science tell us we can do?  We have all the stakeholders sitting around the table as we develop these plans. They all sign up. Our farmers recognize that clean water will make their agriculture more profitable. They recognize that. Developers understand that we need a clean Chesapeake Bay as part of our ability to develop profitable real estate in our community. These are not inconsistent. A serene environment, clean agriculture, a strong agriculture, a strong economy are all hand in hand together.  It is not a choice between one or the other. We recognize that. That is why the Chesapeake Bay Program has never been partisan in We have had Democratic and Republican Governors who supported the Chesapeake Bay We have had legislators lead this effort from both parties. Senator Mac Mathias, who served as the U.Senator from Maryland, was the champion of bringing the Federal Government into the Chesapeake Bay The program is working. It is making the bay safer today, but we still have a long way to go.  We enforce it through the TMDL, the Total Maximum Daily Loads, so we can monitor that we are making the progress we said we could make, based upon best science. And that is what the local stakeholders have signed up for.  When we did our TMDL's, it was challenged. It was challenged in the courts. Mr.Pruitt was one of those who brought a challenge against the TMDL Program in I am thankful that the Third Circuit upheld the legal right of the TMDL, and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision by the Third So we won the legal case.  But it troubles me that a program that is from the ground up, from the local governments up, in which the Federal government is a partner--why it would be challenged when it was supported by the local communities. To me, that case should never have been challenged.  We need the Federal Government to continue to participate with us. The Chesapeake Bay Program is supported through the farm bill, through the Water Resources Development Act, through the Clean Water Act, and through annual appropriations. So we need continued support at the Federal level for the Chesapeake Bay And we need a champion in the Environmental Protection Agency that will help us in that regard.  I want to talk briefly about the Safe Drinking Water Safe drinking water is critically important. We know that in recent years, we have found too much lead in drinking water. We all know, of course, the story of Flint, I could take you to Baltimore where our schools have to cut off their water fountains because of the unsafe levels of lead in the drinking water, if they were permitted to drink from the water fountains.  We can tell you about so many communities in the Nation that have a desperate need to clean up their safe drinking water so that we can protect our children from lead poisoning. I hope my colleagues understand that there is no safe level of lead in the blood. It robs children of their future. It poisons them. I think most people are familiar with the Freddie Gray tragedy in Freddie Gray was a victim of lead poisoning when he was young.  We owe it to our children to make sure we do everything we can so they are not exposed to lead. I asked questions about that during the confirmation hearing of Mr.The answers were less than acceptable and showed his lack of real information about the dangers of lead.  Every Congress should look at their responsibility to build on the record, to leave a cleaner and safer environment for the next generation. The EPA Administrator should be committed to that goal. I do not believe Mr.Pruitt will be that type of leader. For that reason, I will vote against his confirmation.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1052,topic-id,1180,"Mr.President, today I wish to celebrate Black History Month, a time to honor and reflect on the many achievements and sacrifices of African Americans throughout our Nation's history.  This February, we highlight the titans of African-American history. We honor the culture-shifting accomplishments of civil rights icons such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy Height, and our esteemed colleague, Congressman John  As the senior Senator from Maryland, I would be remiss if I didn't also honor Harriet Tubman, Thurgood Marshall, and--perhaps one of the greatest Marylanders in our long history--Frederick There are some out there who may not know it, but Douglass was born in Maryland around 1818. He learned to read and write in Baltimore before escaping slavery. Despite unknowable hardship and systemic discrimination, he went on to become one of the most influential writers, orators, publishers, and abolitionists of his time. Though Douglass fiercely and vocally opposed slavery, he would want us to remember that he stood for the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. These views--revolutionary for the time--gained him increasing prominence, leading to 1872, when Victoria Woodhull chose him as her Vice Presidential nominee.  Frederick Douglass was the first Black American ever to hold that title. His legacy continues to make Maryland proud.  While we take time to recognize Frederick Douglass and others this month, we must also celebrate the countless men and women whose names and heroism will never grace the history books. Let us never forget all of those who suffered discrimination in silence, who endured civil rights abuses without recognition, who sat-in and stood up to oppression without accolade. We should use this month to lift up their memories and to recommit to the causes of justice and equality for which they also fought so diligently.  In particular, we should honor the Black teachers who taught generations of children in the dark, against the odds and sometimes the law, with little more than old, secondhand books and makeshift buildings. We honor the businessowners who laid the foundations of the Black community in places like Baltimore, Harlem, Chicago, Washington, DC, and We honor the civil rights movement foot soldiers who rejected subservience and embraced rebellion by marching in the streets of Selma and We honor the factory workers who left the South behind with hopes of a brighter[[Page S1297]]future, only to struggle in Northern cities for pennies.  For too long, Black Americans' rich and vibrant history has been ignored or obscured by the specter of prejudice. But today, and for the rest of the month, in classrooms and cities across our Nation, we will shine a spotlight on that history.  We will vow to honor it here, now, in the present and in the future, through protecting both the legacy of civil rights and the Americans who are counting on us to uphold them. As lawmakers and as leaders, it is our duty to fight on their behalf. It is our duty to pass laws that will protect all Americans, support all Americans, and defend all Americans, especially those who have been victims of institutional and systemic prejudice.  That is why I introduced the End Racial Profiling Act in 2011. It is incumbent upon every Member in this Chamber to be an advocate for the men and women of color who are singled out every day simply because of their skin color and appearance. These individuals are your constituents. They are my constituents. They are our fellow  They deserve our commitment and an attention span that lasts longer than 1 month a year.  Discriminatory profiling based on race--or religion or gender identity, nation of origin, sexual orientation--has no place in our society. It is un-American; it is also counterproductive. Racial profiling doesn't keep us safer. To the contrary: it breeds hostility and distrust, and it turns communities against law enforcement and against each other. It wastes resources that our law enforcement agencies can't afford to spend. And the more time we waste targeting Americans because of their race or religion, the less time we are devoting to those who are actually committing crimes or trying to harm us.  My End Racial Profiling Act, which I plan to reintroduce this week, would eliminate this harmful practice and instead offer resources for more police training, mandate greater accountability, and offer recourse for Americans who have been unduly profiled.  Our duty to African Americans does not end there. That is why, as ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I intend to introduce the National Security Diversity and Inclusion Workforce Act, which would codify and build upon President Obama's efforts to diversify our national security workforce. Having a workforce that looks like America is not just good personnel policy, it is also a national security imperative.  Our diversity is one of the strongest assets that the United States has. It allows us to connect and work with different communities and countries across the globe; it helps us to foster the relationships we need to fight terrorism across the globe. And having a diverse set of backgrounds, skills, knowledge, perspectives, and experiences contributes to better national security decisionmaking. We should lead the world and protect our homeland not just by preaching pluralism and tolerance, but by practicing it.  While we embark on that mission, we should take with us the words of Frederick Douglass: ``If there is no struggle, there is no progress.'' Everyone in this body has a responsibility to be part of the struggle and, through it, to be part of progress. Everyone in this body has a responsibility to embrace struggle, even when it occurs right here on this floor, if it is in the name of progress.  I am talking about protecting the Voting Rights The right to vote is fundamental to every democracy. Every vote counts and must be counted fairly.  I am talking about ending the senseless and discriminatory practice of racial profiling. It is painful that, in 2017, we still need to explain that Americans should not be considered suspects or targets because of the color of their skin.  I am talking about criminal justice reform--and prioritizing criminal justice reform in this  I am talking about recognizing the incredible contributions of Frederick Douglass, Dorothy Height, Harriet Tubman, Katherine Johnson, Mae Jemison, and others in our public school curricula.  Many Americans would not even recognize their names, and that is a tragic failure on our part to honor Black history.  I am talking about not just talking, but committing to these causes through actions around our States and through legislation right here in this Whether through passing my End Racial Profiling Act or my National Security Diversity and Inclusion Workforce Act or any other bills introduced by my colleagues, Black History Month reminds us that we can and must do more. Let us begin by remembering that Black history is American history. Their story is our story. When we celebrate Black pioneers and activists and inventors and artists, we celebrate the diversity and the strength of character that are the reasons we are here today.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1296.txt,,NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE,2017.0,16.0,February
1054,topic-id,2193,"Mr.President, today I wish to shine a spotlight on the dire security and humanitarian situation in northeastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad basin, precipitated by Boko Haram, and to urge the new administration to organize quickly to address it. Nigeria has been referred to as one of the anchor states of sub-Saharan Africa and our bilateral relationship is one of our most important on the continent. It is the most populous country on the continent. It has the biggest economy. It has contributed troops to regional and U.peacekeeping missions for decades and is a major oil-producing country. Nigeria's population is forecast to grow to 400 million by 2050, overtaking the United States and becoming the world's third most populous country. Nigeria's political and economic influence in the region is difficult to overstate, and it will only increase as the population and economy grow.  That is why I joined Senator Corker in writing to President Obama urging high-level engagement with Nigeria in the wake of the 2015 elections, elections which, while perhaps not perfect, turned out to be a positive story of respect for democracy in the region. For the first time in the nation's history, there was a peaceful transition of power between opposing political parties. Though people feared the worst, Nigerians proved they can be leaders on the continent and in the world. However, for Nigeria to fully realize its enormous promise, it must deal with a range of challenges from rampant corruption, to insecurity and intercommunal violence in the Niger Delta and the Middle Belt, tensions in the southeast, and most immediately the continuing threat Boko Haram poses in northeastern Nigeria and other countries in the Lake Chad basin. It is critical that we help with these efforts.  Since 2010, Boko Haram has devastated northeastern According to the 2016 Global Terrorism Index, Boko Haram has the chilling distinction of being among the deadliest terrorist groups in history, with the second highest death toll from attacks out of all terrorist groups since 2000. In recent years, its attacks have spread to Cameroon, Chad, and The group, which pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2015 and now calls itself the Islamic State West Africa Province, has killed almost 16,000 people. Thousands of others have died as a result of clashes between the military and Boko The terrorist group has kidnapped thousands, including nearly 300 girls from Chibok in April 2014. The whereabouts of almost 200 of the girls remains unknown.  Countries in the Lake Chad basin are experiencing what U.officials and aid workers have called a forgotten crisis as a result of the terrorist group's activities. Nearly 2 million people have been displaced in Nigeria alone. Two hundred thousand Nigerians have fled across borders as refugees. Eight-and-a-half million people in northeast Nigeria are in need of humanitarian assistance. Nearly 2 million people are estimated to be at risk for starvation. Continued insecurity has prevented aid workers from reaching some areas, so the actual needs may be even greater. Last November, Doctors Without Borders expressed fears that malnutrition could wipe out the under-5 population in parts of Nigeria's Borno state.  In his 2015 inaugural address, President Muhammadu Buhari cited Boko[[Page S1298]]Haram as the most pressing issue facing his administration, and to his credit, he has taken some action. The command center for counter Boko Haram operations has been relocated to Maiduguri, and Nigerians are coordinating military action with other countries in the Lake Chad basin. However, despite the Nigerian Government's claims, Boko Haram has not been largely defeated, and attacks continue. Just last month, the Nigerian military warned of a horrifying new tactic: women suicide bombers carrying babies in order to evade detection.  The reports of continued attacks are profoundly disturbing. As tempting as it is to focus on a military solution, we must be very wary of falling into the trap of thinking that the scourge of Boko Haram can be overcome through military means alone. It is critical that we continue to encourage and support the Nigerian Government's use of all of all available tools to counter violent extremism in the northeast. The Obama administration engaged former President Goodluck Jonathan on the need to develop a holistic civilian-security focused counterterrorism strategy, one that addresses legitimate political and economic grievances in affected communities, but that approach was never fully embraced.  There has been movement towards a countering violent extremism approach under President Buhari's leadership, and we should continue to encourage Nigerians to do more. One of the most important ways to engender the trust of the population is to provide access to justice for human rights abuses by security forces. After nearly 2 years in office, Buhari has yet to keep commitments to do so. The government created a human rights desk for the national army last year, which I welcome, but the establishment of the desk in and of itself is not enough. The military has made very serious mistakes for which it must be held accountable.  In mid-2015, Amnesty International released a report alleging that the deaths of 8,000 civilians are attributable to the Nigerian military in northeast The report calls for the investigation of specific military commanders who are alleged to have had knowledge of torture, extrajudicial killings, and arbitrary detentions in overcrowded facilities that lead to thousands of deaths. Buhari said he would launch an investigation. However, we have yet to see any one prosecuted, tried, or convicted. The results of a commission of judicial inquiry into the massacre of more than 300 people in the northern city of Zaria in December 2015 were made public last year. The inquiry found that the deaths were a result of excessive force on the part of the Nigerian army. To date, there has been no action on the part of the federal government to hold abusive security forces accountable. Impunity for human rights abuses serves to undermine all of the work we are doing to counter violent extremism.  In addition to widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings, there are accusations that the military has stolen humanitarian supplies and sexually exploited and abused those living in camps for internally displaced. And many of those freed from Boko Haram have been kept in internment camps for indefinite amounts of time, subject to a screening process that appears inconsistent and is not transparent. Internally displaced persons have reported that the military and local militia take men and boys seeking refuge in camps for screening and they are never seen again. All of these actions have a deleterious effect on efforts to win the hearts and minds of the communities of the northeast, a critical objective to any strategy to defeat Boko  Military impunity is why I remain leery of the proposed sale of Super Tucano fighter aircraft to Now is not the time for the United States to focus on the provision of aircraft and heavy munitions, especially in the wake of the Nigerian Airforce's bombing of a camp for IDPs last month that may have killed up to 200 innocent people and injured many more. Make no mistake. I support security assistance provided in compliance with the Leahy laws. But I support assistance that will have an actual impact on the Nigerian military's effectiveness. Lack of airpower or munitions are not its problem. The real impediments to success include poor command and control, insufficient air to ground coordination, impunity for human rights abuses, and little to no experience working with local communities and humanitarian partners. Addressing those issues could have an enormous impact on the ground.  To help Nigeria respond to the challenges in the northeast, I urge the new administration to take three steps immediately. First, increase our overall humanitarian assistance budget. The administration should ensure that the President's budget request for fiscal year 2018 provides increased baseline funding for all foreign assistance programs. Such funding is currently 30 percent lower than it was in fiscal year 2010, and it is critical that we return baseline funding to a normal and sustainable level following several years of inadequate requests. An approach that erodes baseline funding while temporarily substituting emergency funds is not workable if the United States wants to continue to set an example in the world. An increase in the budget will enable us to make a significant pledge at the February 24 donors conference in We have been generous, but the scale of the emergency demands that we--and our partners--do more. The United States has always led the international response to emergencies such as these, and we must continue to do so. But we can't get blood from a rock. There is no way we can provide adequate money to help the traumatized people in Nigeria and other countries of the Lake Chad basin unless we ensure that the budget for humanitarian assistance is robust without relying on transient funding like I encourage the administration to continue to inform Congress of the status of the humanitarian response, so that we can work as a unified government to help the people of Nigeria overcome the destruction left in the wake of Boko  Nor can we afford a draconian cut to our contributions to international organizations. The World Food Program, WFP, is just beginning to scale up its operations in northeastern But it is under enormous strain. In December, the organization was forced to cut the amount of food it is providing to people in the Central African Republic due to insufficient resources. In fact, funding for CAR is so scarce that in 2016 it was able to give aid to less than a third the number of people it aimed to support. A new drought in Ethiopia has left 5.6 million people in urgent need of assistance according to authorities. The U.humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, Peter de Clercq, warned earlier this month that, without a massive scale up in assistance, parts of Somalia may face famine. Needs in South Sudan continue to rise, with warnings of famine on the horizon. Slashing funding to WFP would be incredibly unwise, as would deep cuts to Women have suffered enormously in this conflict. UNFPA is on the ground supporting mechanisms to both prevent and respond to gender-based violence and care for pregnant women and newborns. We cannot let the specific needs of women and girls go unmet.  Second, the new administration must work with career experts to surge our capacity on the ground. The administration needs to make clear that the current hiring freeze will not affect lifesaving efforts here or abroad, and Embassy Abuja should approve USAID's request to station additional humanitarian experts at post as quickly as possible. We need experienced people working with the Nigerian Government and the international community to coordinate more effective aid delivery. I applaud the U.Agency for International Development, USAID, for dispatching a disaster assistance response team, DART, to Nigeria in November to support government of Nigeria-led efforts to reduce food insecurity in the Boko Haram-affected regions of the country's northeast. The country has not faced a humanitarian emergency like this in a generation. National and state emergency management agencies are overtaxed, have little familiarity with providing a large-scale aid response, and are not accustomed to working with the U.in this manner. Our aid professionals can help. Let me be clear; Nigeria must continue to do its part. It is imperative that[[Page S1299]]President Buhari set a positive cooperative tone with the international community. However, there is no question that we must continue our robust humanitarian response.  Finally, we must get smart about our security assistance. Agreeing to sell planes with more sophisticated targeting systems that will not be on the ground for 2 more years will not fix what is broken with respect to the Nigerian military's response in the north. Right now--today--we and our international partners should redouble our efforts to work with the Nigerians to develop a list of short-term interventions and a long-term plan to address issues related to military professionalism, accountability, improved command and control, more effective communication between and within services, strategic planning, logistics, and auditing. The strategic governance initiative is a step in the right direction, but we must take action that will translate into results in the field as quickly as possible.  The situation in Nigeria is urgent. Few Americans are aware of the importance of Nigeria to the United States or the degree of suffering in northeastern Nigeria, but those of us who are policymakers cannot afford to drop the ball on our support of Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram or for those suffering in the Lake Chad basin. I recognize that it seems to some people that we are being called on to do more now internationally than ever. But we can do this. We are the Nation that conceived the Marshall Plan, worked with allies to execute the Berlin Airlift, and more recently, developed and implemented We are up to the task. And we are not alone. Where America leads, our partners will follow. And I strongly encourage them to do so. Failure to redouble our efforts in these areas could mean that ISIS will gain a foothold in West Africa for a generation.  I thank my colleagues.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1297.txt,,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 43, PROVIDING FOR",2017.0,16.0,February
574,topic-id,2914,"Thank you, Mr.I rise this evening to speak on the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the Director of the Office of Management and I am going to start by talking in a minute about some of the critical roles that the Office of Management and Budget plays.  Before I do that, I want to go back for a moment to some of the comments of my friend who just preceded me on the floor. Going back 8 years ago, I remember that in the last 6 months of 2008, we lost 2.5 million jobs in this country--2.5 million jobs in 6 months. In the first 6 months of 2009, we lost 2.5 million more new jobs. That is 5 million jobs in 12 months.  Since the beginning of 2010, we have added 16 million jobs in this country. The unemployment rate in this country jumped as high as 10 percent by the end of 2009, and by the beginning of this year the unemployment rate was cut in half. During the first fiscal year of this last administration, the Obama-Biden administration, the deficit, the budget they inherited for that fiscal year ballooned to $1.4 trillion. I am an old State treasurer, Congressman, Governor, and now That's a lot of money. We have had in terms of GDP probably higher deficits than that during World War II, but that is a lot of money.  During the last administration, the debt, deficit as we knew it, dropped by about two-thirds, maybe a little more than two-thirds. Do we have a balanced budget coming into this year? Is it better than $1.4 trillion? It sure is.[[Page S1201]]  The unemployment rate was cut by half, the annual deficit has been cut by two-thirds, and instead of losing 5 million jobs as we did in 2008 and 2009, we added 16 million jobs. Could we do better than that? We have. Have we ever had a longer running economic expansion in the history of our country than the last 7 years? I am told we have not. Can we do better?  Hopefully, in our spending plans and in the regulatory work that we do, we will adopt policies that provide the kind of environment that leads to job creation and job preservation. That is what we do. We don't create jobs here. As my friend who is presiding knows, we help create a nurturing environment for job creation. One of the things we need for that is commonsense regulation.  If you look at the role of the OMB Director, one of those listed on this chart, 2, is regulatory process. The regulatory process is the way regulations are created in this Congress, and as the Presiding Officer and others know, it is dictated by legislation called the Administrative Procedure  If the Presiding Officer were an agency that was considering promulgating a rule or regulation, the agency would basically say to the rest of the world: We are thinking of promulgating a regulation on subject x. It is really a heads-up that they are thinking about doing this. It doesn't mean they are going to, but they are thinking about it, so those who might be affected by that regulation, regulation x, would have a chance to say: Hmm, something might be coming our way, and we have an interest in it--or we don't. This gives them a chance to go to the agency and say: We hear you are interested in promulgating a regulation on this particular subject. Let's talk about it. That is why the agency gives a heads-up, so that those who might be affected by it have the opportunity to talk to the agency, come to their elected officials, and share their opinions.  The agency can accept the comments they get or reject them. The Members of Congress can accept or reject them. We can actually arrange for our constituents who might have an interest in a proposed or possible regulation to arrange for meetings to make sure the agency that is thinking about promulgating a new rule or different rule or regulation has an opportunity to meet with those who would be affected positively or negatively.  The agency, armed with that information--the input they receive from filing a notice of rulemaking--if they decide to go forward, they will eventually propose a draft rule. This is not a final rule or regulation, but a draft. They promulgate that draft regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act, and those who are interested in or affected positively or negatively by the draft regulation again have the opportunity to go back and talk to the folks who promulgated that rule or regulation, stating what it is they like or don't like, proposing changes. They look us up--the Representatives, Senators--and say: Here are our concerns. We think this should be strengthened or weakened or taken out or added.  There is a period of time--a comment period--for the draft regulations. Sometimes those who can be affected by the regulations will come to us and say: We don't think we have enough time to fully understand what the effects of this draft regulation would be, and we would like to have more time to comment. Then what we do as elected officials is reach out to the agency and say: We don't have enough time. We are hearing from too many of our constituents that there is not enough time. How about another week or month or some reasonable period of time? Sometimes we get what we ask for, and sometimes we don't. Sometimes we get half of what we ask for, but that is the way it works.  At the end of the day, the agency may decide that they have enough of a bad response--bad vibrations from those who would be affected, as opposed to picking up good vibrations--and the agency may pull the reg entirely and say: We will do this another time but not now. But they might go ahead and change the drafting to prepare to offer the final regulation.  When the agency is ready to report out the drafted regulation, that is not the end of it because that is where OMB comes into play. There is an agency within OMB called OIRA, which refers to an oversight role that the OMB plays. Essentially, as we used to say in the Navy, if a message or something were sent from one level of command to another to another, we actually say we ``chopped'' it through different levels of command. My colleague who has better experience in the military, as I recall, may have had a similar kind of experience. But the draft regulation that is promulgated has to be chopped through It has to be chopped through They have the final say, and they can kick it back to the agency or not.  Changes may or may not be made, but eventually the final reg is published in the Federal There is a period of time that runs, and eventually if folks really don't like it enough they can basically file a suit and go to court to try to block the regulation. We see that happen from time to time. Faced with a suit, the agency might want to pull it back and make some further modifications. We can join in those amicus briefs or not. If all else fails, Harry Reid, who used to be the majority leader, a Democrat, wrote a law a number of years ago, the Congressional Review Act, which allows the Congress, years from now, to take another look and see if it is something--it is not that old, it had regs come out in the last couple of months--and ask: Is this a good idea or not? And if the majority of the House and Senate, with the consent of the President, say: No, we don't think this regulation is a good idea, it can basically be taken off the field and put on the shelf.  That is the way the process works. Some people don't think that is a very good process. I think it is pretty good. I hope that if Mick Mulvaney is confirmed to this job, this regulatory process is one that will be put to good use.  One of the things Cass Sunstein did, at the direction of President Obama, was begin a look-back policy, saying we are going to look not just forward for new regulations, we are going to look back at the old ones we have and see which ones have maybe outlived their utilization and should be eliminated or modified. I have stopped counting how much money has been saved during the look-back process over the last several years, but it is in the billions of dollars--maybe even in the tens of billions of dollars by now. I hope the next OMB Director will continue it.  We have been joined here by my colleague from I would just ask him if he is pressed for time. I will go maybe about another 10 minutes, and then it is all yours.  Another big job of the OMB Director, not surprisingly, is to help the President prepare in submitting a budget. I want to take just a minute and maybe use another chart to talk about how we spend our money. As my colleagues know, the spending is a pie chart kind of like this, and it is divided into maybe four major areas. One of those is--some people call it mandatory spending. I call it entitlement spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, maybe veterans' benefits. It is spending the people are entitled to by virtue of being a certain age, being disabled, maybe having served in our Nation's military, maybe being disabled in the course of military service, maybe they earned a GI bill. Those are the kinds of things that are being considered as entitlements or mandatory spending. As a percentage of the budget, if we look at the green colors here, it adds up to a little more than half the budget.  Another maybe 5 to 10 percent of the budget is this sort of beige color or gray--this area right here. It is about 5 to 10 percent of the budget. It is debt service, principal interest on our Nation's debt. Fortunately, our interest rates are low. If they ever go up, ``Katy, bar the door.'' Then the principal on the debt service will go up a whole lot. We have been blessed with low interest rates. It will not be that way forever.  So entitlement spending, a little over 50 percent; debt service, principal interest on the debt, 5, 10 percent.  The rest is called discretionary spending. It is defense spending so it is about 40 percent discretionary spending. That is the spending that is done by our Appropriations Committee, about a dozen Appropriations subcommittees, including Agriculture,[[Page S1202]]Armed Services, Housing, Transportation, you name it.  Over half of the amount of spending that is called discretionary spending, right here in the blue, more than half of that is defense spending and less than half of that is called nondefense discretionary spending.  As it turns out, we could eliminate, I am told, every bit of our nondefense discretionary spending, and we would still have a budget deficit. That would be everything from agriculture to the environment, to transportation, law enforcement, prisons, you name it; the whole kit and caboodle, everything other than defense. I don't think we want to get rid of all that. We might want to find more efficient ways to spend that money. God knows we can find more efficient ways in spending defense money.  One of the ways we can do that is to take a page from something that happened today in the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and with our governmental affairs hat on, we had the leader of the Government Accountability Office with us. We also had a couple of inspectors general, and we had the head of the Census They came to talk with us and present to us something called the GAO--Government Accountability Office--high-risk list. What is a high-risk list? It is a list of programs that are in danger of wasting a lot of money. It could include roughly $400 billion a year in revenues that we are leaving on the table; owed but not collecting. It could be $300 billion a year in major weapons systems cost overruns. It could be $110 billion, $115 billion a year on something called improper payments, moneys that are paid wrongly, mistakenly--not fraud but just mistaken payments--and it can include a lot of other things. It could be properties that the Federal Government needs to get rid of, and we have done good work on that. Senator Portman and I worked on that, as did Senator Coburn when he was here, and we worked a lot on property reforms. With the help of Senator Johnson last Congress, I think we made pretty good progress.  There are a lot of ways we waste money. What we do in the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, with our governmental affairs hat on, is we use the GAO high-risk list as a to-do list to be able to save money. If you have GAO, in concert with the Office of Management and Budget, working together with the inspectors general in every major Federal agency, working with the oversight committees in the Senate, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and with our counterpart oversight committee in the House--if we all are working together, going in the same direction, we can actually figure out how to save a lot of money in defense spending and nondefense. With all the overpayments that occur in Medicare and Medicaid--it is almost $100 billion just between those two--we could actually make some real progress. Our budget deficit is still too large.  Not that many years ago, when Bill Clinton was President, the last 4 years of that administration, we had 4 years of balanced budgets. We had not had a balanced budget since 1968. Over the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, we had four balanced budgets in a row.  How did we do it? One, we had a good economy, as you all recall. There were more jobs created in those 8 years than any 8 years in the history of the country. I was Governor then, and there were more jobs created in those 8 years in Delaware than any year in the history of our I like to say I didn't create one of them, but we tried to create a nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. One of those ways--one of the elements that is important--is certainty and predictability.  It has been mentioned earlier today that the concern that a number of people have with Congressman Mulvaney as OMB Director is he allegedly has said government shutdowns are not that concerning. I don't know his exact words. One of the things we were reminded of today by GAO is, businesses need predictability, they need certainty, but the other thing they need--what the Federal Government needs and its employees need are some predictability and certainty as well. Stop-and-go government is painful to businesses, but it is especially painful and wasteful for the Federal Continuing resolutions, government shutdowns--our Federal employees spend a lot of time just preparing for shutdowns. That is wasteful, it is demoralizing, and we can't do that.  I think that is--I will stop there. I see the majority leader is here, and I want to be respectful to him. There are other concerns I have that I will submit, but I hope my colleagues will keep these thoughts and these concerns in mind when we consider the nomination of Mr.Mulvaney to head up  I would say to my friend the majority leader, I appreciate the time we had together in your office earlier this week. I would just ask him to consider one more time, if we had the opportunity for a judge in Oklahoma to make a decision tomorrow on the access to the emails we discussed, I think we could all vote with a clear conscience a week from Monday on the nomination of the Administrator for the I would encourage the majority leader to do that.  Thank you very much.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, I thank my friend from Delaware for his suggestion and giving me a moment here--I am not sure whether he is finished--but to just ask unanimous consent on a matter.

940,topic-id,1123,"Mr.President and colleagues, if I could have your attention, please. Five minutes please. Two years ago, the Center for Media and Democracy filed a petition under Oklahoma FOIA law called the Oklahoma Open Records For 2 years, the appeal of that petition was blocked. Earlier this year, a lawsuit was brought to require the release of thousands of emails from the AG's office in Oklahoma with the fossil fuel industry, oil companies, coal companies, and the like. Six hours from right now, an expedited hearing will take place in the district court of  Earlier this week, nine members of the Environment and Public Works Committee wrote and asked the judge who is going to preside over that hearing today to move forward expeditiously, and she is. We also wrote and asked the majority leader to delay the vote on cloture for Scott Pruitt until a week from He has declined.  Thomas Jefferson used to say: If the people know the truth, they will not make a mistake. Colleagues, we need to know the truth. Speaking of the truth, there is an old saying that says: People may not believe what we say. They will believe what we do.  As a candidate, as nominee, and President-elect, Donald Trump has made clear his job, his goal is to degrade and to destroy the Environmental Protection Like a lot of things he says, we asked: Did he mean it? With the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, it is clear he did.  In Mr.Pruitt, Trump has found someone who, as AG of the State of Oklahoma, shut down your environmental protection unit in that office. He went on to raise millions of dollars for fossil fuel industries and other sources used to sue the Environmental Protection Agency because of their efforts to reduce methane emissions, their efforts to stop cross-border pollution, their efforts to cut methane emissions, their efforts to fight smog, haze, and ozone. Under Attorney General Pruitt's stewardship in Oklahoma, child asthma is well above the national average. Fish advisories in lakes in Oklahoma have more than doubled. All 16 counties in Oklahoma that are evaluated by the American Lung Association for clean air received an F last year--every one of them. Earthquakes have risen over the last dozen years in Oklahoma, from one or two per year to one or two per day. That is only the earthquakes that exceed 3.0 on the Richter scale.  When we asked Scott Pruitt today to name one battle he had led to reduce pollution in his State, he cited the issue involving the Illinois River, which we later learned was actually much more the work of his predecessor than it was his. When I asked him to name one environmental rule and regulation that he supported, he declined to do so. We are coming off of yet another hottest year on record. They are experiencing monsoon-like rains in California this month after years of drought. Temperatures in Alaska are so warm, we are not sure some years that they are going to actually have the Iditarod dog race, sea levels are rising from New England to Miami, there is a huge crack in the ice in Antarctica, and Scott Pruitt raises questions about the validity of the science around climate change. In last year's election, a lot of people said: We want to take our country back. To what? The Cuyahoga River which caught on fire; the L.smog that was so bad, when I ran it hurt my lungs.  Some say: Is it possible to have clean air and clean water with a strong environment? That is nonsense. We can have both. Since Richard Nixon signed into law creating the EPA, guess what. GDP in this country has grown by 200 percent or more. Since losing 5 million jobs in the great recession, we added 16 million jobs, the unemployment rate is down by half.  We still have work to do, my friends. There are communities in the United States where water is unsafe to drink. There are millions of kids and grandkids who have asthma. We have fish advisories that abound from sea to shining sea. The sea level is rising up and down the east coast. State Route 1 in my State, our major highway, was shut down again last week, not because of a huge storm but just because of sea level rise.  Let me close by saying that when our grandchildren ask us years from now what we did about it, I want to tell them we did the right thing. We did not back down. We stood our ground. We voted to face this challenge to our people and to the planet, and to overcome those challenges.[[Page S1230]]  Please, join us in voting no on the motion to invoke cloture.  Thank you.

944,topic-id,1477,"Mr.President, I just want to follow up on the comments of my friend, the chairman from Wyoming, and I note that Scott Pruitt has responded to more questions than anyone in EPA history since Gina McCarthy, the past Administrator who responded to more than 1,400 questions, and she actually responded to them completely, not evasively and not indirectly. She needed more time, given the volume of questions, and more time was granted so she might more fully answer the questions that were raised. I just wanted to add that if I could.  Mr.President, I come to the floor to share with you and with our colleagues the reasons I oppose the nomination of Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the EPA Over the last month, we have had a number of President Trump's nominees come before the committee and be debated on the Senate floor, as you know.  We have had multiple confirmation hearings in a single day, with Members[[Page S1234]]running to and from hearings trying to learn more about nominees and get important questions answered. So I understand if some of my colleagues who have attended back-to-back hearings have not yet delved into Scott Pruitt's record as deeply as we have on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and that is why we are here today.  As ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I, along with my colleagues on the committee, have scoured Mr.Pruitt's record to the best of our ability with the somewhat limited information the nominee has provided.  We sat through his nomination hearing, where we asked him fundamental questions about his views on the role of the EPA and what he would do to protect our environment and public health. We submitted additional questions we had for the record and read through all of Mr.Pruitt's responses. We have done our due diligence with the information we received, and I want to share with my colleagues and all of those watching exactly why, based on this review, I cannot support Mr.Pruitt's nomination.  First, I think it is important to revisit just why the EPA is still so critical. This Agency was created 46 years ago by a Republican President named Richard Nixon with the support of a bipartisan Their task was implementing our Nation's most important clean air, clean water, and safe chemical laws. The EPA is required to use sound science to protect both our environment and our public health, and, by and large, the EPA has done it successfully--not perfectly but successfully for decades while our economy has continued to grow. Many people may not remember a time before the EPA, a time when States had to work individually to protect citizens in the communities in which they lived, a time before the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act were signed into law, a time when businesses operating throughout the United States were faced with a myriad of conflicting State and local laws affecting our health and environment. The choking smog and soot of a half century ago seems unfathomable now. Rivers on fire and deadly toxic plumes sound like something almost for another world, impossible in our United States of  Today we have the luxury of largely forgetting these frightening circumstances, thanks to the efforts of the EPA and its employees, in partnership with State and local governments and with countries and companies and businesses across The EPA and its many partners throughout the country have been so successful that it is easy for some of us to forget why this Agency is so critical. Some may presume there is not much more for this Agency to do. That could not be further from the truth.  The environmental threats we face today are real. They don't respect State boundaries. Over time, my State of Delaware has made great strides in cleaning up our own air pollution, but our work only goes so far.  In Delaware, like many States on the east coast, we sit at the end of what is known as America's tailpipe. Ninety percent of the pollution in Delaware comes from outside the First State, from plants hundreds of miles away in places like Kentucky, Ohio, my native West Virginia, Indiana, and throughout the  As Governor of Delaware, even if I had eliminated every source of air pollution within our State by stopping every combustion source and ordering every motor vehicle off our roads, Delawareans would still face deadly doses of air pollution. Should Delawareans be forced to live with consequences of decisions made by polluters hundreds or even thousands of miles away from us? I don't think so. I don't think so. That is not the Golden Rule I know.  Fortunately, the EPA has recently implemented something called the good neighbor rule to make sure all States do their fair share to clean up our air. Every citizen in this country has a right to breathe clean air, regardless of where they live, whether they live in a downwind or an upwind That is why we have the  We have known for decades that most of the mercury in our fish comes from air pollution that is emitted from the dirtiest coal plants and then settles in our waterways. We know mercury is a powerful neurotoxin that accumulates in our body over time, threatening the health of this generation and generations to come. The EPA recently issued public health protections to clean up the toxic air pollution from our dirtiest coal plants, allowing families in Danville, where I grew up alongside the Dan River, and thousands of other communities that can once again eat fish from our rivers, lakes, and streams without concern of mercury poisoning. That is why we have the  Too often, when States and local communities are pinched for cash, they try to save money by shortchanging clean air and water protections. Improvements to infrastructure are often ignored, corners are cut, and solutions are adopted that may save dollars now but inflict costly unnecessary damage later.  As we have seen most recently in the city of Flint, MI, these cuts can have a terrible and even tragic impact on the health of the most vulnerable in our society, especially on the youngest among us. Today, the citizens of Flint still lack clean drinking water, and a new generation in that city which has been exposed to high levels of lead faces an uncertain future. That is why we have the  Many people don't know it, but Delaware is the lowest lying State in our The highest point in the State of Delaware is a bridge. Back home, the reality that our climate is changing is not up for debate. Families and business owners face the stark realities of climate change almost every single day. Tackling that challenge is not just the right thing to do or what is best for Delaware's economy, it is a matter of survival. Our little State alone cannot stem the flow of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere that is largely causing our climate to change, our seas to rise, and our coastlines to retreat. Every State--every State--must do its fair share to safeguard our climate and their neighbors. That is why we have the  Examples of the air and water pollution produced by one State and fouling the air and water of others can still be found in too many parts of America, like the runoff from Pennsylvania that degrades the waters of the Chesapeake Bay or the haze exported from other States that oftentimes shrouds the Smoky Mountains and degrades visibility at the Grand That is why we have the  Throughout my years in the Senate and as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have had the opportunity to consider the credentials of five different nominees to serve as EPA Administrator--individuals put forth by both Democratic and Republican I have supported candidates in the past because they were able to clearly demonstrate their commitment--candidates like former New Jersey Republican Governor Christine Whitman and former Utah Governor Mike I was proud to support them both, proud of their service, and proud of their role as head of But I have supported candidates like them because they clearly demonstrated their commitment to advancing the mission of the EPA--the mission to protect human health and to protect our environment. Never have I been forced to consider a candidate to lead the EPA who has been so focused throughout his career on crippling the Agency he now seeks to lead or so hostile to the basic protections to keep Americans and our environment safe.

965,topic-id,859,"Mr.President, I would like to follow up on something our friend from Mississippi was just saying. I want to make it clear that I am not really interested in obstructing. I am not interested at all in obstructing. What I am interested in is getting to the truth about this nominee and others.  Two years ago, an organization called the Center for Media and Democracy petitioned, under the Oklahoma open records law--it is a FOIA-like law at the State level--they asked for access to thousands of emails that were sent from or to the attorney general's office under Scott That was 2 years ago. They have repeatedly renewed that request over time, and it has not been granted.  Why might emails be germane? Well, they are germane because many of the emails were with industries that have differences with the EPA and in some cases are involved in lawsuits, a number of which were sponsored by or joined in by Attorney General  Two years after the request to see those emails was submitted to the attorney general's office, they had not seen one of them. A lawsuit was filed earlier this month asking the court--I think it is called the district court of Oklahoma, a State court--asking to see the emails and asking that the court intervene so that the Center for Media and Democracy would have access to the emails.  The Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee wrote to the judge, and we shared our voice because we have been making the same request of the attorney general's office--of the attorney general--as part of the nominations process. He has declined to provide the emails to the Congress, the Senate, and we have let the judge know that we appreciate her attention to this matter and hope she might even expedite it. Well, an expedited hearing is called for this afternoon on the sharing of these emails that have been blocked, stonewalled, for 2 years.  What we did as Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee is I met with the majority leader, and nine of us wrote to the majority leader, and we said: With all due respect, we suggest to give the judge time to make a decision, and if the judge says the emails should be opened up, allow us to have until a week from this coming Monday to look at the emails to see if there is anything inappropriate or untoward that could be revealed.  That request to the majority leader--he was very nice about it, but he basically said: We are not going to do that.  I renewed the request here yesterday on the floor, and he said: No, we are not going to do that.  I am generally one who thinks it is very important for us to communicate, collaborate, cooperate around here, as I think most of my colleagues would attest, but in this case, I don't think we made an unreasonable request of the nominee. And I think to block access to these emails--even when petitioned under the Oklahoma FOIA law, backed up by our support--for nothing to happen is just wrong. That is just wrong.  So hopefully when the judge has this hearing later this afternoon--actually, in 2 hours--we will find out a bit more as to whether the AG's office is going to be asked to turn these emails over and make them public with that information. I hope the answer will be yes. We will see.  I asked Mr.Pruitt 52 questions on December 28 and asked they be responded to by January 9. January 9 came and went, and we were told maybe we would get the responses at the hearing we were going to have on January 18. We had the hearing on January 18, and some of the specific questions were answered, some not, but we submitted as a committee some 1,000 additional questions for the record. That is a lot of questions. I suggested to the committee chairman he give the nominee a reasonable amount of time to respond to those questions. The chairman, in the interest of moving things along, I think, gave the nominee 2 days, which is, in my view, not nearly enough.  If we go back several years ago, the last EPA Administrator was a woman named Gina She was asked a number of questions. She was actually asked more questions, I think 1,400 questions, which is several hundred more than Scott Pruitt but a lot of questions. She did not have enough time to answer the questions, and a little extra time, maybe a week or so, was granted. She answered the questions, as I understand, fully, completely, and directly. I will read some of the questions we asked of Scott Pruitt later today, later tonight, with examples of the kind of answers he provided. Some were reasonably complete, but too many were evasive, indirect, or just nonresponsive. Maybe that is because the chairman only gave him a couple days to respond. That is not the way we ought to be about the business.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1108,topic-id,2915,"Madam President, good morning to our pages and members of our staff, some of whom have been up all night.  I just walked over here from my office in the Hart Building and, along the way, I ran into the Capitol Police and others who are putting in a long day and a long night. I, on behalf of all of us, want to express my thanks to them.  I have said this on several occasions--that I take no joy in going through a chapter like we are going through tonight.  I come from a State on the east coast where we get along pretty well. Democrats and Republicans sort of like each other. They tend to be mainstream, both on the Democratic side and on the Republican side. We have something called the Delaware way, and it is sort of based on the three C's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate. This is what we do. We have done it for a long time, and it seems to work for us. Hopefully, when we get through this chapter--when we get through the nomination process--we will be able to get back to the three C's.  I have the privilege, as the Presiding Officer knows, that when I got out of the Navy I moved to Delaware, and I had an opportunity to serve in a couple of different roles--as the treasurer, as a Congressman, and then as the Governor for 8 years. In my time as Governor, according to laws and the constitution of Delaware, the Governor nominates people to serve as cabinet members, as members of the judiciary, and on a lot of boards and commissions.  During those 8 years that I was privileged to serve as Governor, the legislature was split--the House was Republican, and the Senate was When it came time to nominate members of my cabinet, my predecessor was Governor Mike Castle, as the Senator from Rhode Island knows. He was a moderate Republican, and he had been our Governor, and before that our Lieutenant He was a State legislator and a very successful attorney. When I was elected Governor, he was elected So we literally traded places. He took my job in Congress, in the House, and I took his job as  It was really a wonderful transition, where I tried to help him make that transition to be successful in the House of Representatives, and he tried very much to help me be successful as a new  I, actually, went to something called the New Governor's School, hosted by Roy Romer, who was then the chairman of the National Governors Association--a wonderful guy. We were in the New Governor's School out in Colorado, the newly elected Governors of 1992--Democrats and Republicans, including people like George Bush, Tom Ridge, and the list goes on. If I had had more sleep, I could remember every one of them. It was just wonderful. Mike Levin, who later became the head of the EPA, was one of them.  We learned a lot at the New Governor's School about how to set up and establish an administration, how to put together an administration. Mike Castle, Delaware's Governor, was part of the faculty, if you will, of current Governors who mentored us in the New Governor's School, and it was a blessing in my life.  I asked Governor Castle, as we were going through that transition, to sort of walk me through his own cabinet and to suggest who might want to stay, who might be interested in staying on in a new administration--in my administration--and who, maybe, who would not. It ended up, when I nominated people to serve in my cabinet, that there were several there who had actually served in his. We had mostly I am a But there were some Republicans as well. Below the cabinet level, we had division directors, and we kept almost all--not all but almost all of the division directors we asked to stay, too.  For 8 years as Governor of Delaware, I would nominate people to serve in either cabinet positions or on the judiciary or at other posts; but, for 8 years, we batted 1,000. The State executive committee was terrific in approving people, confirming people to serve in these roles. It was not like I just rushed things--here is who we are nominating. Go pass them.  That is not the way they worked. I asked them for their ideas. We solicited their ideas, not just for the cabinet but, also, for the judiciary.  At the end of the day, it was my role to actually nominate people, and it was their role to provide advice and consent, and they did--a little bit before but, certainly, throughout the nominating process. It worked pretty well. It worked pretty well for our State, and I am proud of the 8 years that our administration worked with the legislature and with nonprofit communities, the faith community, and the business community with what we accomplished.  I was trained as a leader from the age of 12, and our Presiding Officer was trained as a leader, probably, from about the same age. We both served in the military. She is a retired lieutenant colonel, and I am a retired Navy captain. But I was trained that leaders[[Page S1343]]are humble, not haughty. I was trained that leaders should have the hearts of servants, as our job is to serve and not be served. I was trained that we basically call on people not to do what we say but to do what we do. I believe in leadership by example. I was taught that leaders don't hold their fingers up to the wind and see which way the wind is going, but that we should have the courage to stay out of step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune. I was trained that leaders do not lead by dividing folks but by uniting people--by building bridges, not walls. I was trained that leaders should be purveyors of hope--that we should appeal to people's better angels. I was trained that leaders ought to focus on doing what is right, not what is easy or expedient, that we should embrace the Golden Rule--really, embody the Golden Rule--by treating people the way we want to be treated, that we should focus on excellence in everything we do and surround ourselves with the best people we can find. When the team that we lead does well, they get the credit, and when the team that we lead does not do so well, the leader takes the blame. I was trained as a leader with the idea that, when you know you are right, be sure you are right. You just never give up. You never give up.  Those are the leadership skills that were infused into me by my family and my faith. I was in the military for 23 years, plus 4 years as a midshipman, and it helped make me who I am. Those are, really, the leadership blocks that I bring to my job here.  We have had some great leaders in this body. We could use a leadership like I have just described at the top of the food chain in this country, in this administration. We could use that. I, thus far, after about one month into this administration, I haven't seen that kind of leadership that I had hoped for, that we had seen not that long ago.  I want to commend everyone who has come to the floor in the last almost 20 hours on our side--the Democratic side--and on the Republican side to explain our points of view with respect to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator for the EPA in this country.  When Donald Trump was running for President, he said pretty consistently that part of what he wanted to do as President was to degrade and, essentially, destroy the Environmental Protection He didn't just say it once or twice but again and again. When he won the nomination, he said the same thing--that, if elected President, part of his goal would be to degrade and, essentially, destroy the Environmental Protection When he was elected President--a couple of days after being elected--he repeated that pledge.  Sometimes people may not believe what we say, but they will believe what we do. For me, the first clear indication that what he said with respect to the Environmental Protection Agency was something that he intended to do was the selection of a person to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and he chose the attorney general of Oklahoma Scott  Scott was introduced at his confirmation hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee by the two Senators from Oklahoma--James Lankford, with whom I serve on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee--he is a great member--and Jim Inhofe, who is our senior Republican on the Environment and Public Works  They have very high regard for Scott They have spoken here on the floor with regard to him and to his service. When someone whose service and friendship I value as much as I do--James Lankford and Jim Inhofe--speak so highly of a friend and a colleague from their State, it is not easy for me, and it is not easy for the rest of us to oppose that nominee--their friend. But we have done that. We have done that for weeks now, and we have done that now throughout this night.  I take no joy in doing this. Having said that, I take no joy in the fact that the levels of the seas around my little State of Delaware are rising, and we are the lowest lying State in America, and we see every day the vestiges of sea level rise.  I take no joy when I catch the train in the morning to come down here--I go back and forth every day--I take no joy in standing on the platform at the Wilmington train station and in looking at a beautiful riverfront, which we have worked on for 20 years so as to transform an industrial wasteland into something that is lovely, beautiful, and clean. Even now, with the fish that swim in the Christina River, we cannot eat them. In fact, from most of the bodies of water in my State, we cannot eat the fish, and that is because of the mercury that is contained in them. It is not just in my State, and it is not just in our neighbors' States--Maryland and New It is in the States all up and down the east coast.  We live in what is called the end of America's tailpipe. A lot of emissions that are put up into the air come from coal-fired plants to our west--from Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, which is my native State, and other They have, in many cases, really tall smokestacks, and they put their pollution--their air emissions--up through the smokestacks. They go up hundreds and hundreds of feet into the air. The air carries them out of their It carries the pollution out of their States, and where does it settle? It settles in ours. In States from Virginia on up into We live at the end of America's tailpipe.  I take no joy that, of the freshwater fish in our State and a lot of other places on the east coast and, frankly, in other places around the country, you cannot eat those fish anymore.  I want to take a few minutes and pivot from that as background to what we are going to look at--some charts--in a minute. Before we do, I want to talk about why we can't eat the fish in too many places around this country. And the reason why is because we get, I would say about 40 percent of our electricity from coal. Today it is maybe down to around 30, maybe 25 to 30 percent, and maybe 25 to 30 percent from natural gas. We get maybe 20 percent from nuclear, and the rest is from the renewable forms of energy, including wind and solar technology as it has gotten better and better and better.  One of the reasons my colleagues, particularly on this side, have great concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt has to do with mercury. As I have shared with the Senate, a review of Mr.Pruitt's record yields some troubling information about how he managed the unit within his own office in Oklahoma charged with responding to environmental matters. Upon taking office, Mr.Pruitt essentially gutted his own Environmental Protection Unit within the attorney general's office. It appears he abandoned his responsibilities to use his office to protect the public health of Oklahomans and declined to use his authority to hold polluters and bad actors accountable.  A review of Mr.Pruitt's record yields nothing that shows how he will change this behavior if he is confirmed to be EPA In fact, the New York Times reported earlier this month, on February 5, that Mr.Pruitt is drawing up plans to move forward on the President's campaign promise to ``get rid of'' the  Just remember, the EPA does not just involve clean air and clean water and the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. The implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act deals with hazardous materials and the products we use every day. The Environmental Protection Agency is a huge player in the public health of our country for not just adults like us but for young people like these pages, like my children, our grandchildren--all of us--our parents, grandparents. The EPA is in large part responsible for our being a healthier nation.  I am a big believer in going after root causes for illness and sickness, and if you have mercury in your fish, if you have bad stuff in your air, it degrades your health, and that is a big problem. It is a big problem for us in Delaware because we spend a whole lot of money. Ninety percent of the air pollution in my State doesn't come from It isn't generated in It is bad stuff. It is air emissions that come from other They are able to burn coal, get cheap electricity, and because they put stuff in the air in tall smokestacks, they send it over to us. They end up with cheap electricity, lower healthcare costs, and we end up with having to clean up our emissions dramatically, more so than we otherwise would. It is expensive. So we end[[Page S1344]]up with expensive electricity and also healthcare costs that are higher than the places where the pollution is coming from. That is just not right.  I said earlier that I get no joy from going through this nomination battle for Mr.Pruitt with my friends on the other side, but believe me I get no joy from the idea that we end up with expensive electricity in my State and higher health costs because other people in other parts of our country don't embrace the Golden Rule, to treat other people the way you want to be treated.  Going back to the New York Times article on February 5 that indicated that Mr.Pruitt is drawing up plans to move forward on the President's campaign promise to get rid of the EPA, they had these landing teams in the course of the transition to go through each of the agencies. The person who apparently was leading the administration's landing team into the EPA called for reducing the head count at They didn't say we are going to have a hiring freeze at the They didn't say we are going to have a 1- or 2- or 3-percent reduction. They didn't say we were going to reduce it by 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 percent. They said we are going to reduce the head count at the Environmental Protection Agency by two-thirds.  I guess it is possible that whoever this person is that heads up the landing team of the EPA, maybe they don't have pollution in their Maybe the air is pristine, and they can get all the fish they want from all the other rivers, lakes, and streams. They don't have to worry about toxic waste sites or any of that stuff. I doubt it.  I think part of our job is to make sure the EPA can do their job better, but the kind of draconian changes President Trump has talked about--and when you look at the record of the fellow they nominated to lead the EPA, you get the feeling that maybe they are not just talking.  There is an old saying that sometimes people may not believe what we say, they believe what we do so let's just take a look to see what Mr.Pruitt has done in his own State of I would say there are two sides to every story, and we are hearing two sides to every story. What I am going to do here is just draw on his own words.  The New York Times story goes on to say that Mr.Pruitt ``has a blueprint to repeal climate change rules, cut staffing levels, close regional offices and permanently weaken the agency's regulatory authority.''  It continues:       As much as anyone, Mr.Pruitt knows the legal intricacies      of environmental regulation--and deregulation. As Oklahoma's      attorney general over the last six years, he has led or taken      part in 14 lawsuits against the       His changes may not have the dramatic flair favored by ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,179,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February

1112,topic-id,1942,"Madam President, one of the things I love about the Senator from Indiana is he understands there is a Golden We are one another's neighbors, and we need to treat others the way we want to be treated. States need to treat other States the way they would want to be treated.  He also understands a very valuable principle: that it is actually possible to have cleaner air, cleaner water, and strengthen our economy.  When I was an undergrad at Ohio State, a midshipman there, I remember a time up north of us in Cleveland, OH, when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire. The kind of smog we have now in parts of the country, running in places in California, when I was stationed in California in the Navy for a while--there are days when I ran that I knew I wasn't doing a good thing for my lungs.  We have done a lot better than that. While we cleaned up rivers like the Cuyahoga River and we cleaned up the air in a lot of places in the country, we still have work to do. We have made those changes and those improvements and developed technology that we have been able to sell all over the world. That is a good thing.  I thank my friend for getting up at this hour of the day and joining us here and for his leadership, not just in Indiana but here in the It has been a joy. Thank you.  I want to go back to what I was talking about earlier--Scott Pruitt's views. I think they are extreme, uninformed views on mercury regulation. Mr.Pruitt's views on core clean air and clean water laws and the somewhat misleading and oftentimes evasive answers he has given to Members of this body, including myself, ought to be reason enough for Members of this body to reject his nomination.  Two months prior to his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt filed his third major legal action against the EPA's mercury and air toxics rule. This case is still pending before the courts.  For those who don't know the EPA's mercury and air toxics rule, it requires our Nation's largest source of mercury pollution--coal-fired plants--to reduce mercury in a wider range of air toxins.  The EPA issued this rule in 2012, and because of the low cost of compliance, most utilities are already meeting the standards. We made more progress at a faster time, at a lower cost than was actually anticipated. The same thing is true with the elimination of acid rain in New The deal that was worked out was a cap-and-trade approach, but the idea was developed when George Herbert Walker Bush was We ended up with better results for less money and faster time than was anticipated. We can do this.  Mr.Pruitt filed his latest lawsuit alongside with one of the Nation's largest coal companies, Murray Energy Corporation, arguing that the benefits of cleaning up powerplant and mercury and air toxic emissions are ``too speculative'' and not necessary.  Mr.Pruitt goes on to argue that there are only ``hypothetically exposed persons'' from mercury and air toxic emissions from powerplants. Imagine that--``hypothetically exposed persons.'' Again, I would say: Really?  Finally, Mr.Pruitt argues: ``The EPA cannot properly conclude it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants under Section 112.''  His boiled-down arguments before the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit is basically this: If the EPA cannot quantify benefits in dollars, then those benefits don't count. Never mind that we know the real-world health threats to people this kind of air pollution poses.  The idea of looking at public health protection only through the lens of dollars and cents is not a new one, but it can be a dangerous one. The tools we have for projecting costs and putting a dollar value on the health benefits are not gospel and are not the only way of analyzing the economic impacts of reducing pollution on a community. With toxic substances, such as lead, arsenic, and mercury, health benefits are sometimes difficult to quantify.[[Page S1347]]  Meanwhile, the EPA is chock-full of examples where benefits are underestimated and costs overestimated once programs are implemented and businesses find efficient ways of cutting pollution. In my part of the country, we call that Yankee intuition.  Mr.Pruitt's argument ignores that it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the loss of IQ, increased risk of cancer, or other long-term health effects known to occur when exposed to mercury and air toxic emissions.  In Mr.Pruitt's world, if we can't accurately translate loss of IQ into dollars lost, the benefits of cleaning up mercury for other children is ``too speculative'' for it to be ``necessary and appropriate'' for EPA to act. As a father of three sons, I find this way of thinking alarming.  I have a poster here with a message from a woman in Wilmington, Wilmington is in the northern part of the State, where our congressional delegation and Governor and his family live.  This is from I would ask Mr.Pruitt this: How much does it cost to lose an organ like I have, to lose a parent or child from cancer? How much do sick days and inhalers cost? Families are struggling to make ends meet. Many of these costs are not in dollars alone.  Thank you,  Sarah is a mother and a registered nurse. She wrote to me earlier this month to express her concerns regarding Mr.Pruitt's nomination. In her letter, she explained to me that she was born in 1978, in Western New York It is miles away from the Love Canal neighborhood. It is the site of one of the most appalling environmental disasters in American history.  For those who don't know or don't recall, Love Canal was a planned community that eventually had to be evacuated after 22,000 barrels of toxic waste were dumped into the nearby canal--22,000 barrels. Families whose homes were contaminated with chemicals and toxic waste had to leave. Many faced serious health challenges later in their lives. These were the real threats we faced before we had the EPA or laws on the books that held polluters accountable for dumping hazardous chemicals in our waters.  Sarah's mother was pregnant with her while Love Canal was being evacuated, just 7 miles away from their home. Fast forward a few decades. When Sarah was 30, she found out that she had thyroid cancer. Doctors told her that exposure to radiation, perhaps from the radioactive hotspots near her hometown, is a proven risk factor for thyroid cancer.  Sarah now has a daughter of her own who, unfortunately, suffers from reactive airway disease that causes her trouble breathing, and symptoms can last anywhere from a few minutes to hours at a time.  Sarah, in her letter, said to me:       Mr.Pruitt believes that the EPA places economic hardships      on businesses through unnecessary regulation. True economic      hardship is experienced by those who are often least      protected by environmental laws.  She went on to say:       I would ask Mr.Pruitt: How much does it ``cost'' to lose      an organ like I have? To lose a parent or child to cancer?      How much do sick days and inhalers cost families already      struggling to make ends meet? What is the life path of a      person who starts out with compromised lungs? Many of these      costs are not in dollars alone.  Sarah couldn't be more right. An EPA Administrator must be able to understand the true human cost of rolling back or eliminating critical environmental regulations.  Mr.Pruitt's persistent and extreme views--or at least extreme views in my mind--on the mercury and air toxics rule are some of the reasons I have grave concerns about his nomination to be EPA  I can't help but wonder if Mr.Pruitt will continue to fight this rule--not from outside the Agency, but from inside the  I wonder if Mr.Pruitt would uphold the clean air protection that has bipartisan support or if he would kill the rule and take his extreme views of cost-benefit analysis broader, to other issues such as cleaning up lead in our water or addressing climate change.  That is why I asked him not once, not twice, but three times about his views on the mercury and air toxics rule. I asked him directly three times if EPA should move forward with the rule and if EPA should be regulating mercury and air toxic emissions from powerplants. Each time I asked, the more evasive and misleading the answers became.  In our three exchanges, I was very clear that I was asking about EPA's regulations and the authority to address mercury emissions from powerplants.  However, in Mr.Pruitt's answers, he was very careful to mention that mercury pollution should be regulated under the Clean Air Act but never said that mercury and other air toxic emissions from powerplants should be or must be regulated.  Mercury, as it turns out, is emitted by many sources. Coal-fired powerplants happen to be the largest emitter in this country. Under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, Congress listed mercury as a hazardous air pollutant and required the EPA to regulate all major emissions sources.  It seems that Mr.Pruitt tried to avoid the questions I asked him about controlling mercury and air toxic powerplant emissions. He, instead, answered about regulating mercury more broadly.  While he was trying to evade the questions, what he did say was very misleading to the committee.  In our second exchange, I mentioned his three lawsuits against the mercury and air toxics rule. I asked Mr.Pruitt if he believed the EPA should not move forward with this rule and, if there were no rule, how would States clean up mercury?  Mr.Pruitt answered: ``I actually have not stated that I believe the EPA should not move forward on regulating mercury or adopting rulemaking in that regard.''  He went on to say: ``There is not a statement--or belief--that I have that mercury is something that shouldn't be regulated under Section 112 as a Hazardous Air Pollutant.''  Well, anyone who supports the mercury and air toxics rule and heard that might be very encouraged by these comments.  Sadly, Mr.Pruitt is on record many times stating that the EPA should not move forward regulating mercury and air toxic powerplant emissions.  Here are a few quotes from the legal briefs that Mr.Pruitt filed in his many lawsuits against this rule that directly contradict his statements in our hearing.  In his first lawsuit against the mercury and air toxics rule, called White Stallion v. EPA, Mr.Pruitt argued: ``Finally, the record does not support EPA's findings that mercury, non-mercury Hazardous Air Pollutant metals, and acid gas Hazardous Air Pollutants pose public health hazards.''  In his most recent case with Murray Energy, he argues that, with respect to powerplant mercury emissions, the ``EPA cannot properly conclude that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate Hazardous Air Pollutants under Section 112.''  These statements go well beyond questioning the ``process.'' Instead, they suggest the EPA should not be regulating mercury and toxic air emissions from powerplants.  This is not what even Trump voters voted for in They did not go to the polls hoping that the new President would make their air dirtier or their water more polluted.  This is another case of this nominee trying to mislead, or at least obscure, the truth before It is a troublesome pattern that I fear will only get worse if Mr.Pruitt is confirmed as EPA  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1114,topic-id,4047,"Mr.President, I want to continue to share with you and my colleagues the reasons I am opposed to the nomination of Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  What we do know about Mr.Pruitt's past record--and there is still a good deal we don't know and are not able to learn in committee. We know Mr.Pruitt abandoned his responsibilities to[[Page S1348]]protect Oklahomans from harmful pollution. Instead of holding polluters and bad actors in the State accountable, Mr.Pruitt spent a lot of his time as attorney general in Oklahoma suing the Environmental Protection  These days, going after the EPA public health protection seems like a popular thing to do. In fact, the EPA is often a target of nasty tweets from our current  Without the burning rivers or thick smog and soot in the air, which used to be all too common, some may presume that there is not much more for the EPA to do to protect the public health of our country from pollution. People may presume that our environmental protection problems are behind us, and States can take care of themselves when it comes to clean air and clean water, as Mr.Pruitt has suggested time and again.  I am a recovering Governor, a former Governor for 8 years. I have huge regard for what Governors can do, States can do. There is a lot we can do, but not everything. That is not the idea--that States can simply take care of themselves when it comes to clean air and water, and there is no need for Federal oversight. It is just wrong. I think it is untrue. The EPA continues to play a critical role in protecting our health, especially for the most vulnerable, including the very young and the elderly. The environmental threats we face today are real and do not respect State borders.  One such threat is ozone, known to some as smog pollution. Five times, Mr.Pruitt has sued the EPA over regulations to require new ozone, smog protections. Several of these lawsuits are still pending before the courts.  Mr.Pruitt's actions against ozone health protection are deeply concerning to me, as I represent a State at the end of what many of us on the east coast call America's tailpipe. Emissions come up from the Midwest, largely, and blow from west to east and end up in our air and in our water. Ninety percent of the smog and air pollution in Delaware comes from outside of our State, partly from hundreds of miles away--places like Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and across the  I said many times as Governor of Delaware that I could have eliminated every source of pollution within my State--shut down the factories, cleared every car off the road, stopped trains and transit or boats. Delaware would still face the deadly doses of air pollution, not from our own emissions, but from those blowing in our State from hundreds of miles away.  We have a chart here to my left that we call the Ozone Report Ozone is smog pollution. It deals not with quality of air pollution in Delaware, but it is a report card for Cross-state ozone air pollution continues to be a major problem for our State, but it also is for many States across the country.  In Mr.Pruitt's own home State of Oklahoma, every county with an air quality monitor--16 counties; they have more than 16 counties, but 16 have air quality monitors--has an unhealthy level of ozone pollution, according to the American Lung The American Lung Association assigns grades in subjects, just as for our pages here in school. My home State has A's and B's. The Oklahoma Lung Association assigns a grade for ozone pollution. In these 16 counties, they assigned a grade of F, not just in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10--all 16.  For decades, we have known that air pollution is linked to serious health problems like asthma attacks, strokes, heart attacks, and other respiratory illnesses. Most recently, ozone has been linked to early deaths.  We have another chart that refers to Oklahoma's asthma rate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6.3 million children in this country have been diagnosed with asthma--6.3 million children diagnosed with asthma. In Mr.Pruitt's home State of Oklahoma, 1 in 10 children have asthma, which is higher than the national average. That is 6.3 million children nationwide, and more than 112,000 in Oklahoma who have to worry, during the high ozone days, if they are going to have an asthma attack.  Recognizing the very real dangers of ozone pollution, Congress passed the EPA to provide our country with the ozone air quality standards based on the best science available, and they review that standard every 5 years. After reviewing more than 1,000 medical and scientific studies, the EPA concluded about 2 years ago, in 2015, that the 2008 ozone health standard was too weak and no longer adequately protected public health.  The EPA's 2015 rule was purely a statement of fact to protect our health. To protect the 6.3 million children with asthma, we need less ozone pollution in our air. To protect 112,000 children with asthma in Oklahoma, we need a stronger air quality standard.  Fortunately, many of today's biggest emitters of ozone pollution, such as older coal plants, are already scheduled to be cleaned up. This means the costs of compliance are not as high as they might have been 2, 4, or 6 years ago.  As attorney general, Mr.Pruitt had a choice between two paths. If he had taken the first path, Mr.Pruitt could have worked with his Department of Environmental Quality and the business community to ensure ozone polluters in his own State cleaned up. He could have worked with the EPA, not against it. By doing so, he would have protected Oklahomans and citizens living in downwind States from ozone pollution and helped economic growth and the State at the same time. It is important to note that many attorneys general in this country decided to take this path, including our own attorney general, Matt Denn, in  Instead, Mr.Pruitt took a second path, the one that led to suing the Agency, the EPA, in an attempt to weaken protections. It is no surprise that Mr.Pruitt chose to sue the EPA, based on his clear record.  I have a poster here with some of his own words. After all, it was Mr.Pruitt who just last summer explicitly said it bothers him that Congress and the EPA work together to ensure Americans have clean air to breathe--or appears to say that. Specifically, here is what he said:       Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make      clean air.'' That's something that bothers me, that then      Congress gives to EPA this general grant of authority.  That was at Hillsdale College in July of 2016. I would just ask, What then does Mr.Pruitt think the role of EPA is? It is hardly some kind of extreme overreach to keep deadly pollutants out of the air we breathe. I think most people think that. Mr.Pruitt chose to sue the EPA over the science used to justify in writing the regulations, citing the polluters over the medical and scientific experts who have published over 1,000 scientific studies that the EPA has reviewed.  Mr.Pruitt did not stop there. He also sued the EPA over protections for downwind Delaware is one of them. Let me repeat that. Mr.Pruitt not only sued the EPA over science used in the 2015 ozone rule, but he also sued the EPA over the good neighbor rule to make sure all States do their fair share to clean up the air. Without the good neighbor rule, Delawareans, and all Americans living in downwind States, will be forced to live with the consequences of decisions made by polluters hundreds or thousands of miles from them. Mr.Pruitt took the stance that every citizen in this country does not have the right to breathe clean air. Mr.Pruitt took the stance that the lawyers and polluters know better than scientists and medical experts when it comes to ozone pollution and health.  The President is asking us in this body to confirm Mr.Pruitt as our EPA As Senators, we can also choose between two paths. The first path is protecting public health and ensuring that those who elected us have clean air to breathe. The second path is protecting polluters. I will be taking the path that protects the health of my constituents. I urge my colleagues to do the same for theirs.  In just a moment, I am going to pause. Before I do, I mention this good neighbor rule. Some people call it the cross-border rule. The idea behind it is that we ought to treat one another as neighbors.  Where does the good neighbor rule come from? It actually comes from the And it comes not just from the Bible, it comes from almost every major religion in the world--the idea that we ought to treat other people the way we want to be treated. If you look at every major religion in the world, it pretty much says that.  In the New Testament, some will recall, there is a passage where the Pharisees were after this young Rabbi,[[Page S1349]]a couple thousand years ago, trying to put Him on the spot. They said: You are so smart, young Rabbi, why don't You tell us what is the greatest rule of law, the greatest commandment of all? He said: Not one, there are two. He mentioned the first. Then He said: The second is love thy neighbor as thyself.  One of the pharisees said to Him: Who is our neighbor? And He went on to tell them the parable of the good A man traveling through the country was attacked, left for dead in a ditch. Later in the day, three people walked by, one from a part of the country where this guy was sort of his neighbor. He walked on by. Next, a person of the cloth, a rabbi, walked on by. He didn't stop. The third guy that came through was from a place called They are like at enmity, at odds with one another. They are not friendly; they are at odds with one another.  He saw the fellow had been beaten and left for dead. He ministered to him and put him on his animal and took him to an inn. For a day and a night, he tried to help him get better. After the second day, the guy from Samaria had to leave and had to go someplace else. He said to the innkeeper: This fellow still isn't well enough to travel, but here is some money to help pay for his care here for another day or two. When I come back through, if you need more money or it costs more, I will even up with you. He left, but he left the guy who had been beaten in a lot better shape.  After telling His story, the young Rabbi turned to the pharisee and he said: Who was the good neighbor?  Well, there was the one--the first fellow who came by who took pity on the guy who had been beaten and left for dead and treated him the way he would have wanted to be treated.  That is really the foundation of the good neighbor rule that the EPA has promulgated. It is the foundation of the idea that pollution does cross borders and because of that, we need to have--if we can't pass a law, we need some kind of rule or regulation to ensure that everybody is being a good neighbor because it is not fair that my State--that we can pretty much close down my State's economy, transportation systems, powerplants, and still have a problem with air quality. That is just not fair.  I think next we are going to look at some editorial statements that are in opposition to Mr.I know there are editorial statements that support him. I don't have any of those today, not surprisingly. But I do want to go through a couple from newspapers around the country: New York Times, Bangor News up in Maine, L.Times, Denver Post, Chicago Sun Times, Dallas Morning  I have received a number of letters from Delawareans about the nomination of Mr.Pruitt to lead the For the record, as of I guess last night, my office had received a total of seven letters, emails, or faxes supporting Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I guess this is from all sources, not just But we have gotten seven letters supporting Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I received 1,880 letters opposing his nomination. That is pretty amazing. We don't get this kind of volume of letters, emails, or faxes, but 1,880 opposed, 7 letters supporting.  But it is not just Delawareans who are worried about the idea of Mr.Pruitt at the helm of EPA; over the past 3 months, editorial boards across our country have expressed their own serious concerns about this nominee as well.  I want to share a few of those with my colleagues and the world this morning. Back in December, the New York Times wrote these words. I will read them. This is from December, a couple of months ago:       Had Donald Trump spent an entire year scouring the country      for someone to weaken clean air and clean water laws and      repudiate America's leadership role in the global battle      against climate change, he could not have found a more      suitable candidate than Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma Attorney       That is a pretty bold charge. The editorial describes Mr.Pruitt's nomination--it goes on to say ``an aggressively bad choice''; ``a poke in the eye to a long history of bipartisan cooperation on environmental issues.''  Again, the EPA was not created in a law signed by a Democrat, it was by a  The Times goes on to say ``bad choice''; ``a poke in the eye . . . to a nation that has come to depend on an agency for healthy air and drinkable water.''  And to the 195 countries that agreed in Paris last year to reduce their emissions, climate-changing greenhouse gas, in the belief that the United States should show the way, the Times concludes with these words: ``Mr.Pruitt is the wrong person to lead an agency charged with the custody of the nation's environment.''  The Senate cares about public good and needs to send his nomination to the dustbin.  But I know that not everyone is a huge fan of the New York Times these days, so let's move a little further north. Let's go up to They have a paper up there called the Bangor Daily I have a poster from them as well. Last month, the Bangor Daily News Editorial Board wrote these words. Again, this is last month:       As attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt has been openly      hostile to the EPA's mission of protecting human health by      regulating dangerous pollutants, such as mercury and carbon      dioxide. Someone who has repeatedly tried to prevent the EPA      from doing its job surely should be disqualified from      overseeing the agency.  You know, we generally believe that Presidents have wide latitude in choosing the members of their I think Governors should have wide latitude. As a former Governor, I said to our Delaware Legislature: I have been elected; give me the opportunity to put together my own team and judge us on our performance.  However, some nominees of some Presidents are so--probably Democrats and Republicans, but especially in this case, with this President--some nominees are so unqualified or philosophically unfit that Senators should use their constitutional powers to reject them. Scott Pruitt, President Donald Trump's pick to head the EPA, is one of those nominees.  I voted for more of the nominees of this President than against. Several of them are quite good. I serve on a committee called Homeland Security and Governmental To succeed Secretary Jeh Johnson, the President nominated retired Marine general John Francis Kelly, who was a terrific soldier, marine, leader for our country, and will be a great I wish they were all of his caliber. I wish they were.  The Bangor paper went on to write:       Critics of the EPA tend to focus on rules and laws that the      agency is involved in writing that protect little-known      animals or landscapes, such as wetlands. But, the agency's      primary mission is to safeguard the health of Americans      through landmark laws such as Clean Water Act and Clean Air       Finally at the Bangor paper, they got to what is really at stake with Scott Pruitt at the head of EPA when we have a President who has repeatedly said he would like to get rid of the EPA in almost every forum. This is what they said at the Bangor News:       We are under no illusions that Mr.Trump is suddenly going      to become a champion of environmental protection, even if      that is synonymous with protecting human life. But Pruitt is      so hostile to the EPA's core mission that putting him in      charge would move the United States dangerously backwards.  But it is not just the east coast editorial boards that are worried about Scott Pruitt's nomination. Let's go to the west coast, the L.Times in California, the State that has led the way in environmental protection. The L.Times Editorial Board wrote--let's see if we have a date. It is February 4, this month. This is what they wrote:       Yes, Trump won the election, and as president, he's      entitled to appoint people who reflect his political views.      But when the president's policies and appointees pose such a      fundamental threat to the nation, even a Senate controlled by      his fellow Republicans--whose first loyalty should be to the      people of the United States--must put the nation's best      interests ahead of party loyalty.  They continue at the L.Times and say:       Pruitt wouldn't run the agency as just another small-     government Republican interested in paring excessive      limitations on business. He actually disagrees with the      fundamental mission of the He has argued that the      federal government should play a lesser role in environmental      protection, and that primary control should be given to the      states.  That is wrongheaded. Putting West Virginia, my native State, in charge of[[Page S1350]]its coal industry or Texas in charge of its oil industry would lead to horrific environmental damage, not just there but in the neighboring States downwind and downstream, according to the L.Times Editorial  The L.Times Editorial concludes by saying:       Putting Pruitt in charge of the EPA, however, poses an      irreversible risk to the planet, and the Senate needs to      ensure that doesn't happen.  It is not just the coastal editorial boards that have opposed Mr.The Denver Post noted that--these are their words from 2 months ago, December 8, 2016:       It looks like Trump truly does wish to dismantle the      His pick of Scott Pruitt to lead it strikes us as      unnecessarily reckless, and we urge the Senate to deny      confirmation and to demand a better way forward.  It is not on the poster, but the Denver paper went on to add: Does the Nation really want a Big Oil mouthpiece running the agency that's charged with the laudable task of keeping our air and water safe?  Let's head up to Chicago, where the Sun Times was editorializing in the great State of The Chicago Sun Times Editorial Board--let's see what we have for a date. It looks like December 8, a couple of months ago. This is what they said:       We are living in a time that calls for stepping up efforts      across the board to protect our environment for future      generations.       Unfortunately, President-elect Donald Trump has appointed      Scott Pruitt, an open foe of environmental initiatives, to      head the U.Environmental Protection That      demonstrates a callous disregard for the health of our nation      and planet just as rapid technological advances hold out hope      for avoiding the worst effects of climate change.  It went on to say:       During his campaign, Trump said he would dismantle      President Barrack Obama's environmental policies and pull the      United States out of the 195-nation Paris accord to reduce      greenhouse gases and climate change. After the election,      Trump moderated his tone, saying he has an open mind about      climate change. His appointment of Pruitt, however, suggests      that if he's open to anything, it's strictly more pollution.  They concluded with these words:       At a time when serious scientists worry about cataclysmic      disasters threatened by climate change, we can't afford to      put our future in the hands of an apologist for the fossil      fuel industry. America needs an EPA chief who understands the      value of environmental successes we have achieved and the      critical importance of building on them.  But perhaps these aren't convincing enough. Travel with me down to Texas because they have a problem even in Texas, in the Lone Star One of the newspapers there, the Dallas Morning News, wrote just last week:       Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a veteran of a      years-long courthouse campaign to undermine the Environmental      Protection Agency, is the wrong choice to lead the agency      under President Donald It's hard to imagine a worse      choice.  They highlighted the long-term impact of putting Mr.Pruitt in charge of the Here is what they said:       The post of EPA administrator is a critical one, and      nowhere is that more tangible than here in energy-rich  Again, this is the Dallas Morning News:       Many industry voices have already raised toasts to Pruitt's      nomination, concluding that his plans to eviscerate the EPA's      regulatory oversight of oil and gas companies, and other      polluters, will strengthen the state's economic fortunes.  The Morning News went on to write that the Senators from Texas must ``look beyond the short-sighted calculus and vote in the long-term interests of Put simply, Texas' economy will be stronger over time if its environment is cleaner and if its people are healthier.''  This is just one of a handful of the editorial boards that have raised serious and substantive objections to Mr.Pruitt's nomination, and for very good reason. They don't just come from the Northeast or from the east coast, they don't just come from the Southeast or the Midwest; they come from the west coast and even Texas itself. We ought to listen to them. We ought to listen to them. They are not all wrong. In fact, I fear they are right.  With that, I see we have been joined on the floor by a young man from Connecticut who came to share some of his own thoughts with us on these important topics.  I just want to thank him for the good work he does in so many areas. He and I have been partners together on trying to make sure the people of this country have access to affordable healthcare, and we get better results for less money, and I applaud him for those efforts, as he knows probably better than I, to try to ensure that people are healthy. It is not enough just to provide healthcare for them when they get sick. We call that sick care. We try to make sure we are doing things up front to prevent people from getting sick, to enable them to stay healthy. A lot of that really leads right to the work of the Environmental Protection  Leadership is so important in everything we do. It is the most critical factor in everything. Leadership is the key to the success of any organization, large or small, that I have ever been a part of or observed. I don't care if it is a business, I don't care if it is a church, I don't care if it is a school, I don't care if it is a military unit, a sports team, or the U.Senate, leadership is key. The EPA is key.  Show me enlightened, well-qualified leadership, and I will show you a successful operation.

The Republican nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, 278 letters against; Mr.Pruitt, 1,880 letters and emails against. Delawareans are clearly paying attention, and they are clearly concerned by the idea of Mr.Pruitt being charged with safeguarding our environment and our health.  I want to take a moment to read a letter sent to me--I have gotten a lot of letters--a letter sent to me last week from a woman named Danielle D., a new mother and small business owner who lives in Wilmington with her infant son. Danielle wrote to me because her concerns go beyond politics and to the core values of giving our children the best lives possible. Danielle writes:       Dear Senator Carper, I am reaching out to you today as both      a new mother and a small business owner urging you to oppose      Scott Pruitt's nomination as Administrator of the U.     Environmental Protection       As a business owner, I support a number of President      Trump's cabinet nominations and many of his pro-business      policies. But there are very few policy decisions that touch      every facet of our lives like environmental policies do. Our      environment affects our health, our economy and our everyday      lives. The decisions we now make will affect Americans for      generations to come.  She goes on to say:       My son is 5 months old. Like any parent, I can only hope I      am able to advance my son's life by leaps and bounds, as my      parents did for me.       However, I am extremely concerned that, should Mr.Pruitt      be chosen as the next Administrator of the EPA, the decisions      we make today will make it nearly impossible for me to leave      my son a better environment than the one I brought him into.       In short, we need an EPA Administrator who will work to      prove America is the best when it comes to environmental      policy. Mr.Pruitt is not that person.

1181,topic-id,629,"Mr.President, a few minutes ago, we stopped everything right here. And the Chaplain of the U.Senate came in, Barry Black, retired Navy Admiral, and gave a prayer.  We have a Bible study group that meets every We met yesterday in Jim Inhofe's hideaway. Every time we meet, almost without exception, Chaplain Black reminds us, Democrats and Republicans--those of us who need the most help--he reminds us that of all the times the Scripture is invoked, we should ask for wisdom.  Well, I ask for wisdom every night for myself, my colleagues in the Senate, over in the House, the President, the Vice President, their spouses, every night, that we have the opportunity to gain some wisdom.  When Scott Pruitt was nominated to be the Administrator for EPA, I sent him a letter December 28, asking 52 questions, asking for responses by January 10. They didn't come by January 10. We had a hearing January 18. I got some answers, not all. One thing I also asked for, also asked for by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, was access to what the folks had been asking for from the Center for Media and Democracy for 2 years; that is, access to thousands of emails in the AG's office, and their back and forth with the fossil fuel industry, oil, natural gas, coal, a variety of others. We would like to have access to those emails.  When Mr.Pruitt went before our committee for his hearing on January 18, he was asked the question: Do you promise to provide information reasonably requested by committees here in the United States Senate and the Congress, including in electronic form? He said, yes, but he didn't do it. In fact, for 2 years, the AG's office fought off efforts to try to gain access to that information, electronic media. It took a judge calling an emergency meeting yesterday in Oklahoma to say to the attorney general's office: You have to turn this information over. Normally, you know how long a 4-year request takes in Oklahoma to get results like this? We are talking maybe 2 months. This was over 2 years.  Finally, we are going to get access to those emails. There may be a reason why they were so reluctant to share those emails with us. We are going to find out starting next Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, when we get them. If we don't vote to support Senator Merkley's proposal, to put off the vote until the Monday after we come back from recess, we will not have the opportunity to take advantage of what the judge--I don't know if it is by Divine intervention, but this judge has given us the opportunity to gain wisdom, to make a smarter decision, to make a better informed decision. If we vote up or down on Mr.Pruitt's nomination today, we pass up a great opportunity to get a fuller picture.  Now, my Republican friends will say: He sat through the longest hearing of any EPA Administrator in the history of our country. He has answered 1,000 questions.  Let me just say that Gina McCarthy answered more when she was the last EPA She answered more--quite a few more, actually. She took a little extra time to actually answer the questions.[[Page S1389]]  So many of the responses we got to the thousands of questions for the record asked of this nominee--the answers were evasive, they were incomplete, and sometimes they were just totally nonresponsive. You can say he answered all the questions, but how well? How thoroughly? How responsively? Not so good. Not so good.  Friends, I want to put up here on the board--I have a board here. Let's look at the third one.  Mr.President, how much time do I have?  The PRESIDING Five and a half minutes.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,179,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,16.0,February
1182,topic-id,873,"We have heard from a lot of folks, different views on what we ought to be doing. One of them was from a fellow whose name is Kyle Meyaard-Who is Mr.Schaap? Good question. Mr.Schaap is the leader or one of the spokespersons from a group--if I can find it here; here we go--spokesperson for Young Evangelicals for Climate  He wrote us about Mr.Pruitt's nomination. Here is what he had to say:       If Scott Pruitt embraces his own self-described pro-life      stance, he should fight to protect vulnerable lives from      birth to natural death--the lives of children born and      unborn, the elderly, people of color--from environmental      pollution. He should work tirelessly to ensure that everyone      has clean water and air. He should strengthen, not      eviscerate, an agency equipped to honor God's mandate to      steward and care for the creation.  Mr.Meyaard-Schaap goes on to say:       As Oklahoma attorney general, however, [Mr.Pruitt] has      done just the opposite. He has had the chance to protect      people from pollution and the harms of climate change.      Instead, he has brought multiple lawsuits against the EPA to      overturn measures that would safeguard clean water and air.      He had the chance to defend policies that cut the power plant      pollution that fuels climate change and pollutes our air.      Instead, he cast doubt on climate change and downplayed the      moral imperative to safeguard our climate and environment. He      had a chance to assist EPA in its mission to protect public      health. Instead, he questioned its mission entirely and      sought to defend industry from regulation.  We all have an obligation to protect the health of our children, families, and the world in which we live. For me, this is not only my responsibility as a parent and official elected to serve the people of Delaware, it is a moral calling.  I sat for 8 years as a member of the National Governors For 7 years, this lady sat right next to me. She was the Governor of New She went on to become the Administrator of the EPA--the very position to which Scott Pruitt has been nominated. She is not a She is not a progressive. She is not a knee-jerk liberal. She is a She was not only the Governor of her State for 7 years, but she was the head of EPA for a number of years under George Here is what she basically said about Scott Pruitt, her words, not mine. She said: ``[I] can't recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who was so disdainful of the agency and the science behind what the agency does.'' That bears repeating. ``[I] can't recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the agency and the science behind what the agency does.'' Those are powerful words.  Just as I think that the idea of waiting another week or so to get the wisdom that those thousands of emails might contain--we don't have to wait for the wisdom from this woman who has walked in these shoes, serving her State as Governor and serving this country as the leader of the Agency that protects our public health for all of us. My hope is that our colleagues will not ignore this wisdom.  Lastly, I will say this: Come next Thursday, Friday, we are going to start getting the information from these emails. We will find out if there is fire where there is smoke or not. If there is nothing there, then there is nothing there, but if there is something there, I just want to say to my Republican friends, if you are ready to vote for this nominee without this complete information that we could have here to be put to use in a positive way within 10 days from now, you pass up a big opportunity.  We are in a sense, by voting on this nomination without this information, flying blind. I am an old naval flight officer, 23 years as a naval flight officer, retired Navy captain. In Southeast Asia, you flew into monsoons and really bad weather sometimes. We never wanted to fly blind. We always wanted to have a good weather forecast. We want to avoid the places we ought to avoid. We wanted to fly at altitudes that were safe. We wanted to use our radars to be able to find the pockets to go through to be safe. We never wanted to fly blind.  If we basically, before we close up shop, vote for this nominee with incomplete information, we are flying blind. It wasn't a very smart thing to do in naval aviation, and it would not be a smart thing for us to do here.  This is not a warning; this is just friendly advice from one colleague to another: It is worth waiting an extra week to get this information rather than voting today without it. Again, the words of our Chaplain Barry Black always invoking us to ask for wisdom--I have asked for it. The wisdom that I would impart to all of us today: Hit the pause button. Get the information next week. Make our decision then.  I yield back my time. Thanks so much.  The PRESIDING The Senator's time has expired.

I come from a little State like Senator Coons, where we get along pretty well. We believe in the three Cs--communicate, collaborate, compromise.  But you know what else gives me no joy? I get no joy from rising sea levels from New England to Miami that threatens our way of life. It threatens our way of life. I get no joy from fish advisories that keep us from eating fish in every State in this country. I get no joy being one of the States at the end of America's tailpipe, where we get all this pollution from other States and end up with higher costs and worse healthcare. I get no joy from the millions of kids who go to school this week with their inhalers because they have asthma. I get no joy from people who appear before us as nominees, take 1,000 questions for the Record, and give us answers that in too many cases are evasive, indirect, or incomplete. I get no joy from nominees who appear before us who pledge to provide information requested by us responsibly, including electronic media, and never give it to us, who fight for 2 years to make sure we never get it.

1514,topic-id,1056,"Mr.President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today on behalf of Delaware's congressional delegation--Senator Chris Coons, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester and myself--to honor the exemplary service of MG Frank Vavala, the adjutant general for Delaware for the past 18 years. As Governor of Delaware, I had the distinct pleasure of nominating him to serve as Adjutant General in February 1999, and I believe to this day it is one of the best appointments I have ever made. Over the past 17 years, General Vavala has been responsible for the mission readiness of all Delaware National Guard units for both Federal and State missions. He served as a cabinet member and trusted military adviser to me when I was Governor, as well as to the three Governors who succeeded me: Governor Ruth Ann Minner, Governor Jack Markell, and Governor John In January 2017, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general Delaware, becoming the first three-star general to lead the Delaware National  During General Vavala's tenure, the Delaware National Guard has deployed close to 11,000 soldiers and airmen to support our State and country. Nearly half of them were deployed abroad to Bosnia, South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan, among other countries. Once in theater, these men and women accomplished almost every mission imaginable. They ran entry control points, provided security, established and maintained communications and conducted medical evacuation from the battlefield. They also transported supplies, patients, personnel, and dignitaries in both UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and C-130 aircraft. Back at home, the Delaware Guard activated nearly 5,000 soldiers and airmen to provide support during 11 snowstorms, 8 hurricanes--including Hurricane Katrina, where hundreds of Delawareans went to help in Mississippi and Louisiana just 24 hours after the devastating storm made landfall, 1 tornado, dozens of floods, Noreasters, and three Presidential inaugurations. General Vavala oversaw all operations as soldiers and airmen helped transport emergency workers and patients, evacuate flooded areas, get residents to shelter, safety, and medical assistance, and even set up emergency communications around the state.  Like many successful leaders, General Vavala did not keep regular office hours. He routinely came to work early, stayed late, and worked on weekends. He was known for taking the time to recognize, thank, console, and care for everyone under his command from the newest private to the most senior officer. He valued every person who wore the uniform equally. I have met Guard men and women for years who say that when they were in a time of need, General Vavala was there for them, even if it was just taking time to drop them an email or note. Sometimes they wondered how he found out about what was going on in their lives, but however he did it, he found out. He prioritized his soldiers and airmen over his own career. Instead of focusing the spotlight on his individual accomplishments, General Vavala put the focus on his soldiers and airmen, and it made his career a success by default.  In addition to holding dozens of leadership positions in the Delaware Guard, General Vavala held prominent national positions as president of the Adjutants General Association of the United States and chairman of the board of the National Guard Association of the United States, During his tenure as chairman of the board, NGAUS was the main driver responsible for passing one of the most significant pieces of military legislation in a generation--the National Guard Empowerment General Vavala provided key testimony before the House Armed Services Committee and was instrumental in advocating for the passage of this important legislation. In January 2012, Delaware's 146th General Assembly passed H.10, recognizing General Vavala for his leading role in helping to reshape the U.military.  General Vavala is from a proud military family, having served with both his father, COL Frank Vavala, and brother MSG Gerard Before serving as Adjutant General, he worked full time for the DuPont Company, where he was employed as marketing services supervisor for 31 years. He has been honored with the Anthony of Padua Founders' Award and the Italian-American Man of the Year He also cares about his community, organizing food drives for the Food Bank of Delaware, and he is a person of deep faith who takes seriously what the Bible tells us about caring for others and focused that into his career as Adjutant  I believe General Vavala has been successful in no small part because he possesses some of the finest leadership qualities that I have ever observed in a military leader. Frank Vavala understands that leaders are humble, not haughty. They have the heart of a servant. They understand that their role is to serve, not be served. General Vavala leads by example. It is not do as I say, but do as I do. He knows that the best leaders aren't afraid to keep out of step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune. Leaders unite, not divide. They build bridges not walls. They are aspirational--purveyors of hope, if you will--and they appeal to our better angels. Like the very best leaders, Frank has always sought to do what is right, not what is easy or expedient. He embraces the Golden Rule and treats other people the way he would want to be treated. General Vavala surrounds himself with the best people he can find. When his team does well, he gives the credit to them. And when the team falls short of the mark, this leader takes the blame. Finally, when General Frank Vavala knows he is right, he never gives up. As a leader, General Frank Vavala is in a class of his own, and he is one whom other leaders, both civilian and military would do well to emulate.  On behalf of Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, let me wholeheartedly thank General Vavala for his service to our country and our The leadership and commitment he modeled helped keep Delaware and our Nation more safe and secure. Today, we are honored to be able to offer General Vavala our sincere congratulations on a job well done. From our hearts, we wish him and his wife Jane, who he has been married to for 50 years--along with their children Anne, Jane, and Nick and their three granddaughters--many happy, healthy, and successful years to come.

1703,topic-id,2201,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Representative Zinke to become Secretary of the  As is always the case, I take this opposing position with some trepidation. Having served as the Governor of my State, I appreciate the importance of deference to a chief executive's decisions to build his or her team, but at the same time, I think we in the Senate have a constitutional obligation to provide our advice and to provide our consent because in the end not all nominees are best for the country we are pledged to protect.  Some of my western colleagues may wonder what stake a small State like Delaware on the east coast would have in the selection of a Secretary of the It turns out, there is plenty.  As the chief land steward of our great Nation, the Secretary of the Interior will be asked to manage our collective interests in the conservation, use, and appropriate management of the abundant land, wildlife, mineral and other resources found on our public lands. For that reason alone, we should expect a firm commitment from such a leader that the American taxpayer will receive full value for private use and profit from the use of our Nation's resources, and we need assurances that the use of those resources will not abuse the quality of life for Americans while enhancing the profits of a very limited few.  That, I am very sad to say, does not appear to be Mr.Zinke's track record.[[Page S1464]]For example, as a Congressman, I am told he opposed the Federal coal leasing moratorium ordered by his predecessor, Secretary Some would call this an appropriate reaction to an alleged War on Coal, but let's just take a moment to take a closer look.  As you know, I live in a small State, Delaware, that is, as it turns out, getting smaller almost every day. With each passing tide and every coastal storm, a part of us--our land--disappears forever. We are fighting a valiant and, some would say, futile war against an encroaching sea. This is not a result of variability in weather patterns or long-term trends in ocean dynamics, this is climate change at work.  We are not alone in feeling the effects of our Nation's dependence on and robust use of carbon-based fuels--like coal--over the past couple of centuries.  There are Native Alaskan communities that have to move in their entirety. Think of that. They have to move in their entirety because tides, storms, and waves--assisted by the absence of ice that used to protect them from fierce winter storm surges--are literally eating away at their communities. I am trying to imagine what it would be like as a family to get the news that you have to leave a place that has been your home for generations, the place from which your ancestors derived their sustenance, honored their forbears, and raised their legacies.  I also can't imagine being a person who represents those people and families, having to help them come to grips with the realities of a changing world that we--if we act quickly and assertively--can begin to stabilize.  It means a whole lot to us in Delaware that we take a very careful look at when and how we use the bounty of mineral resources under our public lands. At the very least, that should include--as Secretary Jewell's order envisioned--an assurance that we, as Americans, are paid a price for the coal and other public resources our lands provide that matches the value they represent.  It is the least among us who need our government's help, not those with the most.  We should also, as Secretary Jewell's policy recommended, be aware of and responsible about the climate change implications of the coal sales from public lands. If we humans, as Mr.Zinke admits, are responsible for our changing climate and the fact that my State is slowly eroding away, then we should embrace--not ignore--the commonsense wisdom of the former Secretary of the Given the chance to agree with this common sense in his response to questions from my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Mr.Zinke repeatedly demurred.  Continuing on this theme, Mr.Zinke, in response to questions from Energy and Natural Resource Committee members, supported the Congressional Review Act resolution to eliminate the Obama administration's rule to curb wasteful releases of methane from Bureau of Land Management land-based operations--yet another example of willingness to sell the American people short in favor of a handful of energy companies.  Wasted gas is wasted public revenue. Let me say that again. Wasted gas is wasted public revenue. Wasted methane is adding yet more of a very potent greenhouse gas to our atmosphere.  Given the opportunity to reflect some concerns for Americans, our climate, Delaware's and Alaska's shorelines, and our global obligation to put a lid on climate contributions, this nominee demurs.  We have seen this pattern of helping the few at the expense of the most across the board with too many of this President's nominations. I believe this is ultimately un-American, unwise, unfair, and unacceptable.  I am also concerned with Mr.Zinke's stance toward the use of the Antiquities Act by the President to designate lands as national monuments. Specifically, during his confirmation, we heard a willingness from Congressman Zinke to take the legally uncertain step of revisiting the use of the Antiquities Act by the President to designate lands and historic sites across the Nation as national monuments.  Undermining the Antiquities Act is--I believe and a lot of people believe--bad for conservation, is bad for historical preservation, and is bad for economic development opportunities associated with national monuments and our national parks.  For those who don't know, the Antiquities Act has been used by Presidents dating back to the early 20th century--roughly 100 years--to preserve and protect our Nation's historic sites and preserve Federal lands for all of us--all of us--to enjoy.  During his time in office, President Obama utilized the Antiquities Act to safeguard and preserve Federal lands and cultural and historic sites. Ultimately, he designated over 550 million acres of land as national monuments, including what we call the Delaware national monument.  Delaware, as it turns out, has a special history with the Antiquities Act, which I will take just a moment to talk about today. Before Delaware saw the establishment of national parks in our borders, we had a national monument for a couple of years.  In 2013, President Obama recognized Delaware's important contributions to the founding of the United States, including its role as the first State to ratify the U.Constitution, by creating the First State National Monument, with our urging and support.  Before that designation, Delaware was the only State in the Nation that had neither a national monument or a national park. We were the first State to ratify the Constitution but until a couple of years ago no national park. We were the only State that was in that situation. Simply put, Delaware was missing out on tourism and economic development that a national monument or park can bring.  The economic opportunities afforded to States with national monuments and national parks, as it turns out, are significant--quite significant. Each State with a park or monument sees economic benefits of at least $1 million, I am told, if not much more, in tourism and economic development, and every year millions of Americans and countless others from across the world plan their vacations around America's national parks and monuments.  Believe it or not, if someone in some other country--whether it is Europe, Asia, Latin America, or Central America--if they are interested in coming to the United States, they go on the National Park Service website, and they look up all of the national parks and monuments across the country and decide which ones they might want to visit. The single most popular destination within the U.borders for tourists from other parts around the world, believe it or not, are our national parks. Isn't that extraordinary. The economic opportunities afforded to States with national monuments and national parks are significant--again, around $1 million or more.  Delaware's national park celebrates Delaware's rich colonial history as the first State to ratify the U.As it turns out, the Constitution was first ratified on December 7, 1787.  Many years before that--maybe 150 years before that--the first Finns and Swedes came to America, and they landed in what is now Wilmington, They sailed across the ocean in the Kalmar Nyckel and the Fogel Grip from Sweden and It was before they even had a Finland, and the Swedes and Finns were one.  They sailed through the Delaware Bay and north to the Delaware River and came to an uncharted, unnamed river that headed off to the west, off of the Delaware They went about a mile. When they came, there were a lot of big rocks along the coastline, and they landed there at the rocks. They declared that spot the colony of New Sweden, which later became Wilmington, They built a fort called Fort Christina, and they built a church, the Old Swedes It is the longest continuously operating church in  About 15 miles south of that spot on the Delaware River is actually the river they sailed up on and planted their flag, the Christina They named it after the 12-year-old child Queen of Sweden, but about 50 miles south of the Christina River, further down the Delaware River, is a town of New There is a big statue of William Penn in the town of New Castle, and it is because William Penn first landed in America--not in an area[[Page S1465]]close to Philadelphia where they have Penn's He landed in New Castle, DE, and he brought with him the deeds to the land that later became Pennsylvania and  Further down the coast toward where the Delaware Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean is a town called Lewes, Lewes, DE, was settled by the Dutch, the first time unsuccessfully. The settlers lost their lives. The second time they came back in greater numbers and successfully settled Lewes, DE, and it endures to this day.  The Brits didn't much like the idea that the Dutch had a foothold in that part of Delmarva, in what is now Sussex County, DE, and one night many years ago--several hundred years ago--the British surrounded Lewes, DE, which was then inhabited by the Dutch, and they burned it to the ground. The next morning when the sun came up, there was one house standing in Lewes, DE, and it was Ryves Holt It is believed to be one of the oldest standing houses in all of North  If you drive up from Lewes headed north on Route 1 toward Dover Air Force Base, just before the Dover Air Force Base is a colonial plantation called the Dickinson Plantation, named after John Dickinson who was a penman, an early writer who spoke about and wrote some of the early writings that had been cited and encouraged the colonists in what is now America to rise up against the tyranny of the British  As you go a little further up Route 1 to Dover and go to downtown Dover, you come across an area where there used to be a tavern called the Golden Fleece Tavern, and that was the place where, on December 7, 1787, after three days and nights of debate and discussion, luckily, 25 early colonists decided to ratify the Constitution, which had come down the week before from We were the first State to ratify the  A few years before that, a fellow named Caesar Rodney, who had been president of Delaware and later held any number of offices in the State even before it was a State, actually rode his horse right past the area where the Golden Fleece Tavern was--where the Constitution was ratified--and rode his horse all the way up to Philadelphia, PA, in order to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the Declaration of That is a little bit of the history of  The National Park Service decided 3 years ago that the early colonial settlement leading up to the ratification of the Constitution is what made Delaware unique, and our national park includes a number of those different components. Think of it almost as a necklace with different stones of value and interest around our That is what it is.  That is the national park today. It started off really as a national monument from the Antiquities Given that kind of history, we need to make sure that future administrations and future Presidents have the ability to utilize the Antiquities Act to safeguard the country's history, protect the outdoors for all of us to experience and to enjoy.  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to send what I think is an important message that we want people in our government who are there to help people.

He served in the Navy during the Korean war. After service, Al returned home to join the family business and, in 1962, opened Boscov's first full-service department store, Boscov's West, in suburban Since that time, the Boscov chain has become the largest family-owned department store chain in the Nation, with 45 stores in 7 States, employing some 7,500 coworkers.  Here is what Al said about his store, which shows the attitude he conveyed as a businessperson and a member of the community. When he talked about people visiting his stores, he said:       We like to give people a reason for coming to Boscov's even      when they don't want to buy anything. They enjoy themselves      and hopefully we make a friend.  What a great attitude for any business leader, especially one who opened his business in the town in which he grew up.  Al's family remains especially proud of his continual efforts to fight prejudice and promote cultural understanding. For example, at times of growing racial tension in Reading years ago, Al used his three Reading stores to present a heritage festival, providing the opportunity for the African-American community to share various aspects of Black culture, whether food, art, writing, or entertainment.  Similarly, Al Boscov presented a Puerto Rican heritage festival in both his Reading and Lebanon stores--Lebanon being in the middle of Pennsylvania--again, bringing together the Hispanic, White, and Black communities with a theme of ``Knowing is Understanding.'' His belief that we all must take time to know each other and to take care of each other remains as one of the most important and, his family hopes, lasting legacies.  As the chairman of Boscov's, Al set new standards for successful retailing, community involvement, and civic duty. He founded and led the nonprofit Our City Reading, Inc., to assist Reading in restoring abandoned homes and to bring about a resurgence in downtown Under his leadership, more than 600 families had the opportunity to own and live in a new home. He led the efforts to equip a senior citizens center in downtown The Horizon Center provides seniors with hot meals and activities. I could go on and on, but I will not this afternoon.  It is clear from his life that he was very successful. It is also clear from his life that he gave and gave, not only to his home community of Reading, but well beyond. I know from my own personal experience what he did for northeastern Pennsylvania, for Lackawanna County, Luzerne County, and a lot of other counties as well.  So we are thinking of Al Boscov today, remembering his generosity, remembering his legacy, and remembering the many contributions he made to the Commonwealth of  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

978,topic-id,1755,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to speak in opposition to the nomination of the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency which we all know as the  My concern--I have a number of them, but the principal concern of Mr.Pruitt's nomination is rooted in his record, which I believe is totally inconsistent with the mission of the That mission is to protect human health and the environment. We know the EPA achieves this core goal through the development and enforcement of standards to protect children and families from exposure to dangerous pollutants in our air and water.  Protection of human health means ensuring that our children have clean air and clean water, tackling climate change, which leads to the kind of food insecurity that causes malnutrition in children throughout the world.  I have to say that as a Pennsylvanian, I think I have an obligation to not only speak about these issues but to fight on behalf of policies that will advance the knowledge and mission of the EPA but will be consistent with the directive I am obligated to follow in my State's constitution. In Pennsylvania, if you go back to the founding of Pennsylvania forward, we had many generations, especially through the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, throughout most of the 1800s and into the 1900s, until about the midcentury point, where we didn't do a very good job of protecting our air and water and human health because we let one or another industry pretty much do whatever they wanted until the modern era. Fortunately, since that time, Pennsylvania has made a lot of progress. One of the measures of that progress and something I am bound by is a provision of the State's constitution, article I, section 27, that says people shall ``have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic values of the environment.''  That constitutional provision goes on to talk about each of us as citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania being trustees of the environment--especially and ever more so if you are a part of State government, and I would argue the Federal Government as well. To say I feel an obligation is a major understatement. I think I am bound by that, and that enters into my determination and analysis of Mr.Pruitt's record.  We know in recent years the EPA, acting under the authority it is granted through laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, has developed a number of important standards to advance these priorities--rules like the mercury and air toxics standards, the cross-state air pollution rule, the ozone rule, the new source performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry, the Clean Power Plan, which is meant to obviously focus our policy on climate change, and other policies to reduce exposure to pollutants like methane, volatile organic compounds, mercury, and carbon pollution itself.  According to the American Lung Association's ``State of the Air 2016'' report, these rules reduce the likelihood of premature death, asthma attacks, lung cancer, and heart disease. I would hope that if you have a series of measures in place that reduce the likelihood of asthma attacks, lung cancer, heart disease, and premature death--I would hope we would not only advance those policies but make sure they are not destroyed, undermined, or compromised. It is just common sense to make sure we regulate pollutants like lead, mercury, arsenic, and acid gases, just by way of example.  Yet Mr.Pruitt, who is the attorney general of Oklahoma, filed 14 lawsuits against the EPA to halt the regulation of these pollutants that threaten our children's health. Mr.Pruitt has stood up for the interests of oil and gas companies but has failed to defend, in my judgment, the most vulnerable members of our society, or at least not defend them to the extent that I would hope he would, not only as attorney general of Oklahoma but as the EPA Administrator were he to be confirmed.  When asked during his confirmation to name one clean air or clean water regulation he supported, he couldn't name one.  I believe his record is clear. He fought to dismantle the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, anti-pollution programs to target ozone and mercury in the air, the agreement to clean up the Chesapeake Bay--which I will get to in a moment--and has even denied the science of climate change. Suffice it to say, I have a number of basic concerns about his record and what he would do were he to be confirmed.  One example of the concerns I have involve the Chesapeake Bay with regard to impact in Although Pennsylvania doesn't border the Chesapeake, the Pennsylvania Susquehanna River is the bay's largest source of freshwater. Improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay requires a sustained, coordinated commitment from all of the States in the watershed. I have repeatedly written to the U.Department of Agriculture for increased funding and technical assistance for farmers in Pennsylvania so Pennsylvania can continue to improve the health of the Susquehanna River and the bay.  Pennsylvania has made great strides in addressing the issue of nutrient and sediment runoff into the Chesapeake Bay, but there is more to be done, and Pennsylvania is far from meeting its 2005 Chesapeake Bay pollution reduction goals.  Ensuring that all States in the watershed are coordinated and meeting their commitments is exactly the type of role the EPA should be filling. Mr.Pruitt called the EPA's Chesapeake Bay TMDL standard ``the culmination of the EPA's decade-long attempt to control exactly how States achieve federal water quality requirements under the Clean Water Act, and marks the beginning of the end of meaningful state participation in water pollution regulation.''  Well, I disagree. We don't have time to outline all the reasons, but I strongly disagree with that assessment of the EPA's actions with regard to the Chesapeake Bay, but we do have a long way to go to make sure that we keep it clean. So on clean water, I think we have to insist that neither the EPA Administrator nor anyone in Congress does anything compromising when it comes to clean water.  Climate change. This fall I had an opportunity to spend time in Pennsylvania with Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, one of the leaders in the Senate on the issue of climate change. We did a tour, and one of the places we went was the John Heinz National Wildlife It is America's first urban refuge named after one of my predecessors, Senator Heinz, who tragically died in 1991, but his work on the environment is remembered in places like this wildlife refuge. This is a public space that allows us to enjoy wildlife, outdoor recreation, and environmental education opportunities right outside of a major city--in this case, And this refuge also plays a vital role in climate change resiliency.  Marshes help to filter pollutants from water and can absorb water during heavy rain events, thus helping to reduce the magnitude of flooding. However, the refuge is facing a number of environmental stressors.  Sea level rise could have serious consequences for this fresh water marsh. Not only would rising sea levels lead to the loss of undeveloped dry land and habitat for wildlife, but increased salinity could change the plant makeup of this marsh at the wildlife refuge.  According to EPA, Pennsylvania's climate has warmed more than half a degree Fahrenheit in just the last century. Sea level has also risen nearly 1 foot over the past century, according[[Page S1253]]to NOAA, measured by the tidal gauge in That means that significant portions of the city of Philadelphia could be underwater, including the Philadelphia International Airport, if we fail to act.  We know that 2016 was the warmest year on record for a third year in a row. Also, climate change is not some distant possibility in Pennsylvania or throughout the Nation; it is real, and we are already feeling the effects of climate change.  I will close with one story from one mother who talks about air quality, or the impact of bad air quality and the issue of climate change itself. Jacqueline Smith-Spade, a mother from Philadelphia, recently wrote to me about her 6-year-old son Jonas's struggle with asthma and the emotional and financial toll it takes on her family:       Every time there is an extreme or irregular climate shift,      I can pretty much predict that my son is going to end up in      the emergency room due to the effect of air quality.  She goes on to say later in the letter:       I routinely check the air quality to help predict what type      of day my son and my family might have: With or without      nebulizer?       The physical toll on Jonas also creates a financial burden      on my family. The emergency visits cost $100 each time we go;      $30 copays for each specialist visit; $15 copays for each      pediatrician visit.  She goes on to say:       This is not cheap; however, my insurance greatly helps to      reduce the costs.  She worries, of course, about what might happen on healthcare, but I will not read all of those portions.  She concludes this part of the letter this way:       A reduction in air pollution and climate change will make      life for my 7-year-old son, Jonas, much easier. His reactions      to those changes will be reduced. It will also save my family      countless dollars, stress, and panic attacks.  So said one mom about her son  What we must do, and especially what Mr.Pruitt must do, were he to be confirmed, is to answer her questions--to answer her questions, Jacqueline's questions, and the concerns she has about her son She is not only a taxpayer, but she is someone who will be impacted directly by the actions and the policies that come from this administration as well as the EPA itself.  So I believe that Mr.Pruitt, if he were to be confirmed, must meet the expectations of Jonas and his mother. He works for them, or will work for them, were he to be confirmed.  I know I am out of time. I will just conclude with this: There are a long series of reasons, some of which I wasn't able to get to today, that undergird and form the foundation of my decision not to support the nomination of Scott Pruitt as the next EPA  With that, I yield the floor.

Today we honor Constance Clayton, a trailblazing figure whose career in education positively impacted the lives of countless children in Philadelphia, and whose work continues to pay dividends in the city public schools to this day. Throughout her long career as a teacher and administrator in the Philadelphia School District, Clayton never lost sight of her mission. In her words: ``The children come first.''  A product of Philadelphia public schools, Clayton became the first African American and the first woman to serve as superintendent of the Philadelphia School This Black History Month, we celebrate Clayton's place in that history, but as we do, we should also ask ourselves if we are living up to her legacy and if we are putting the children first--all children everywhere first.

1587,topic-id,1326,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, H.998, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, also known as the SCRUB Act, was introduced by our colleague Jason I happen to be a cosponsor of this bill, as well as the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Goodlatte), the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions), the chairman of the Committee on We rise in support of this bill, the SCRUB  Regulatory accumulation is a significant problem for the Federal Year after year, Federal agencies add regulation after regulation, piling on to an already very complex and crowded regulatory system. The Code of Federal Regulations, also known as the CFR, has some 178,000 pages. These are the regulations that you are supposed to understand if you are in a business--small business, big business, medium-sized business. It contains more than 1 million regulatory restrictions. Every year the Federal Government adds, on average, nearly 12,000 new regulations on top of those.  The regulatory accumulation has considerable impact upon our economy. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, regulatory compliance hurts economic growth by pulling nearly $1.8 trillion out of the economy. Regulations are particularly hard on small businesses that don't have the legal resources and the wherewithal to understand all of the complexities. Many small- and medium-sized businesses will be doing things that they don't necessarily even know or understand could be problematic.  There is room for regulation, don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting there should be no regulation, but we are trying to clean up some of this regulation and weed out the good from the bad. The SCRUB Act will enable the government to do so, and that is why I appreciate our colleague Jason Smith for championing and bringing this bill to the floor again.  The SCRUB Act establishes a bipartisan--and I can't say that enough, a bipartisan--Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of Federal regulation. The commission's goal is to reduce regulatory costs to the economy by at least 15 percent.  The act charges the commission with identifying outdated, obsolete, and unnecessary regulations in need of repeal or amendment. The commission gives priority to those regulations that are 15 years old and older. I think that is an appropriate direction that they should go.  The commission will consist of regulatory experts chosen on a bipartisan basis and confirmed by the United States They will take a governmentwide look at the regulatory system, allowing for impartial and wide-ranging review of outdated and unnecessary regulations.  This is not a new or a partisan concept. In fact, in 1978, President Jimmy Carter issued an executive order requiring agencies to ``periodically review their existing regulations to determine whether they are achieving the policy goals.'' In addition, every President since has required some level of retrospective regulatory self-review by those agencies themselves. In fact, it was President Obama who issued three executive orders on regulatory review. He required agencies to develop retrospective review plans and to set priorities for implementing that review.  The commission is tasked with identifying regulations that ought to be repealed or amended. The commission will use commonsense criteria to determine whether regulations are overlaps, duplicates, or just flat-out conflicts with existing regulations. After expedited congressional approval, agencies are required to repeal some regulations based on the commission's recommendations. So you have people who are selected, they are Senate confirmed, then they bring forward a package that is allowed to be viewed by  Some have said, well, you know, this is excusing Congress from its duties. Quite to the contrary. The committees, Members, everybody should be paying attention to this, but to have a bipartisan group go out and look and make a recommendation, then it is up to Congress whether or not to accept it. We need to go through the House, the Senate, and be signed on by the President in a bipartisan way because there[[Page H1371]]will be Members from both sides of the aisle who will be able to appoint members.  Other regulations would be subject to innovative, regulatory CutGo procedures. The CutGo process gives agencies flexibility on how to prioritize regulatory elimination. It allows agencies to choose which regulations to repeal or amend and at what time. However, new regulations may not be promulgated until equally costly regulations are repealed.  The SCRUB Act gives agencies the direction and momentum needed to implement the regulatory reform our economy needs. We all know that regulations can improve health and safety; but sometimes, with the best intention, these outdated and excessive regulations hurt our economy and put other people in jeopardy. The accumulation over decades is something that should just simply be reviewed. I think it is pretty hard to argue that a review process is unwarranted or unneeded, given the amazing and impactful status that it puts upon those things that are damaging our economy.  I again want to thank Jason Smith for his leadership on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman Bob Goodlatte and the Judiciary staff for their dedicated work on this, as well as Chairman Pete Sessions for his good work on this. A lot of good people have worked on this. I do support it.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

He went on to say, ``It is a disaster the way African Americans are living,'' and asked, ``What the hell do you have to lose?''  In just 3 short weeks, Mr.Speaker, President Trump has shown the world exactly what a disaster looks like. He has put a White supremacist in the White House as his chief political adviser. He has given us an Attorney General who spent the last 30-plus years working against civil and voting rights. He has appointed a shamefully ill-prepared Secretary of Education whose only qualification seems to be her ability to contribute millions to Republic candidates in what can only be described as the textbook definition of pay to play.  Candidate Trump promised to be the hero of working people, but President Trump is doing the exact opposite. His actions tell a lot more than his tweets. His Cabinet is full of millionaires, many with ethical challenges and conflicts of interest. He has already raised the cost of mortgages for many He is proposing that we abandon the overtime rule that would ensure bigger paychecks for working people. He is working to dismantle Wall Street reform and is proposing a border tax that would give corporations a huge tax break while costing working men and women more on groceries, clothes, and other goods.

To candidate Trump's question what do you have to lose, for starters, your voice at the ballot box. A free and fair election is the hallmark of democratic governance, yet the Trump administration and Republics in Congress continue to threaten this basic pillar of democracy. They have promulgated blatant falsehoods about voter fraud, sowing fear and distrust. They have worked and are working across the country to prevent people of color from voting. They are refusing to investigate Russian interference in our elections and are currently moving legislation through the House of Representatives to eliminate the only Federal agency tasked with helping Americans vote and protecting our voting machines from hacking.  As President Trump and his spokespeople continue to make demonstrably false claims about widespread voter fraud and cozying up to the country that attacked our democracy, House Republics just passed out of committee H.634, legislation to eliminate the only Federal agency tasked with certifying the security of our voting machines, the Election Assistance  Forty-seven out of fifty States rely on the EAC's voting machine certification program in some capacity.

Founded to offer education and opportunity to formerly enslaved African Americans, HBCUs have been central institutions in African-American communities for generations.  In 1870, 5 years after the end of the Civil War, the clergy of the African Methodist Episcopal Church set out to create an institution to educate newly freed slaves and train clergy for the AME The Church purchased land in Cokesbury, South Carolina, and named the new college Payne Institute in honor of AME Bishop Daniel Payne, a native of Charleston, South Bishop Payne had become the first Black college president in the United States at Wilberforce University in 1863, which he had helped found.  In 1880, Bishop William Dickerson sought to relocate the college to Columbia and acquired land on which the campus sits today. The institution was renamed Allen University after Richard Allen, the founder and first bishop of the AME  Higher education remained segregated in South Carolina until the early 1960s. The University of South Carolina, also in my district, only a mile away from Allen, for example, admitted its first African American in 1963, 2 years after I graduated college.  Throughout the Jim Crow era, Allen University offered degrees in law, education, and theology, and at one time also offered elementary and high school classes.  Several of its buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places, forming the Allen University Historic Arnett Hall, the oldest building on campus, was constructed in 1891 by the students themselves. It was named after Benjamin Arnett, an early leader of the AME Church, who served on Allen University's Board of  The Chappelle Administration Building, which houses the Chappelle Auditorium, was designed by John Anderson Lankford, known as the dean of Black architects, and completed in 1925. It was named after William David Chappelle, the great-grandfather of comedian Dave Chappelle, and a graduate of Allen University, who later served as its president. Chappelle Auditorium is one of five buildings in Columbia designated a National Historic  This historic campus has been central to the Waverly neighborhood and the African-American community in Black artists, such as Leontyne Price, Langston Hughes, and Brook Benton, all appeared at Chappelle  In 1947, the Reverend James Hinton, then-president of the NAACP of South Carolina, held a rally at Chappelle, which was attended by Reverend Joseph DeLaine, an Allen University alumnus. Inspired by the event, Reverend DeLaine organized families in Summerton, South Carolina, to petition their school district to provide buses for Black students who, at the time, were forced to make a daily walk of 9 miles to school.                              {time}  1915  This case, Briggs v. Elliott, was the first of the five cases that became Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, It is no exaggeration, Mr.Speaker, to say that Allen University was the birthplace of the movement that overturned ``separate but equal'' and brought an end to legal segregation in Allen University will remain central to the struggle for civil rights.  In the early 1960s, Allen University students led demonstrations at segregated lunch counters and participated in many of the marches in Columbia during that period. National leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, and Ralph Abernathy visited Allen during these demonstrations, often staying on campus when they came to town.  Today Allen University is a liberal arts institution still operated by the AME It has graduated many notable elected officials, including State Representative William Clyburn and his wife, Beverly Dozier Clyburn, who retired from the Aiken, South Carolina, City Council several years ago. Retired State Senator Kay Patterson is also a graduate. Two of Allen's alumni, former Senator Clementa Pinckney and Tywanza Sanders, were among the nine who were murdered during the attack at Emanuel AME Church in 2015.  Several of its historic buildings, like Arnett Hall and Chappelle Auditorium, have been restored recently with Federal funding from the HBCU Historic Preservation Program, which this body in its collective wisdom voted unanimously last year to reauthorize. I plan, along with my friend Representative Green and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, to reintroduce that bill this year. I am hopeful that we will repeat the unanimity this year and that the Senate will support our efforts.  Allen University has made an indelible mark on our society over the past 147 years.

Formerly the site of a pre-Civil War plantation, the first classes were held in a dilapidated mansion on the grounds. Benedict Institute was formerly chartered by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1894 and renamed Benedict  From its founding through 1930, Benedict was led by northern White Baptist ministers. In 1930, Reverend John Starks, an alumnus of Benedict, became the school's first African-American president. The heart of its campus has been designated the Benedict College Historic District, consisting of Morgan Hall, Pratt Hall, Duckett Hall, Antisdel Chapel, and Starks  Like Allen University, its neighbor, Benedict College has a long legacy of activism for civil rights and social justice. One of the very first civil rights campaigns in South Carolina was organized at Benedict College in 1937. Students participating in a national NAACP campaign led a demonstration in support of antilynching legislation pending in  One of Benedict's early graduates was Reverend Richard Born into slavery in Barnwell, South Carolina, Reverend Carroll was a prominent Baptist minister in the late 1800s who received honors and appointments from both President William McKinley and President Theodore Other prominent alumni include Modjeska Simkins, a prominent civil rights and public health champion; General Matthew Zimmerman, who served as Chief of Chaplains of the United States Army; and I.Leevy Johnson, the first African-American president of the South Carolina State Bar  In the modern era, under the leadership of President David Swinton, Benedict has grown to a student body of more than 2,800 undergraduate students. In 1995, Swinton revived the football program and marching band 30 years after they had been shut down. He also championed a new sports complex on Two Notch Road in Columbia, which includes a football stadium, tennis courts, baseball fields, and fitness facilities. The liberal arts curriculum now offers degrees in 30 different disciplines. President Swinton also has led the efforts to preserve and restore many of the historic buildings on the campus, in part paid for with Federal funds from the HBCU Historic Preservation Program that we in this Congress have championed.  President Swinton will retire this summer after 23 years of service to the institution. I wish him well and thank him for his leadership.  Today, on the same land where Blacks once toiled in slavery, their descendants are now learning the tools they need to live up to Benedict College's motto: to be powers for good. Like so many HBCUs, Benedict offers a unique religious experience in which students from many different backgrounds share a common struggle for equality, and I am pleased to recognize them today.

The institution was named for Bishop Caleb Clinton, then the presiding bishop of the Palmetto Annual Conference of the A.M.Zion Originally named Clinton Institute, in 1909, it was renamed Clinton Normal and Industrial Institute, and was authorized to grant State teaching certificates.  In the late 1940s, the school was again reorganized as Clinton Junior College, offering various associate degrees in religion and other liberal arts. Still affiliated with the A.M.Zion Church, the college has grown and expanded under its current president, Elaine Copeland, who has led the institution since 2002.  In 2013, the college, for the first time, was accredited to offer two bachelor's degree programs, a bachelor of arts in religious studies, and a bachelor of science in business administration. Subsequently, it has changed its name to Clinton College, and enrollment is at a 15-year high.  For the past 120 years, Clinton College has been providing academic excellence, as well as instilling moral and spiritual growth into their students. The college takes pride in being, and I quote its motto, ``A Beacon of Light for Today's Scholars and Tomorrow's Leaders.''  I thank all of my colleagues for joining me in honoring Clinton College today.  Morris College was established in my hometown of Sumter, South Carolina, by the Baptist Educational and Missionary Convention of South Carolina in 1908, to provide religious and educational training to African Originally, the college featured elementary and high school education, as well as a college curriculum. Its college offered teaching certificates and degrees in liberal arts and theology. In the 1930s and 1940s, Morris dropped its elementary and high school programs and became solely a liberal arts and religious college.  Morris' graduates include First Lieutenant Leroy Bowman, who was part of the original class of Tuskegee These African-American pilots trained in a segregated complex near Tuskegee, Alabama, and the Walterboro Army Air Field in Colleton County, South  First Lieutenant Bowman served in World War II, flew 36 combat missions over Germany, and had a decorated service record.

My father studied theology at Morris in the early 1940s for 3 years, but was not allowed to finish his studies because he had not graduated high school. Having been born in 1897, in segregated South Carolina, he was not[[Page H1250]]allowed to advance beyond the seventh grade. But because he continued to self-teach and study, he was able to pass the college entrance exam. Though he was not allowed to graduate in 1945, as he should have, he was posthumously awarded his bachelor of theology degree 58 years later, in 2003.  Having been led by Luns Richardson for the past 43 years, Morris College has grown to an enrollment over 1,000. Under President Richardson, Morris has established an Army ROTC unit, joined the United Negro College Fund, and has constructed 18 new campus buildings.

794,topic-id,577,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to continue honoring HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, for their significant contributions to our Nation's history.  While only 3 percent of our Nation's higher education institutions are Historically Black, HBCUs produce 20 percent of the African-American college graduates. Today, I recognize and celebrate two of the seven HBCUs in my congressional district, Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College, both in Denmark, South  Voorhees College was founded as Denmark Industrial School in 1897 by Elizabeth Evelyn Wright when she was just 23 years old. Wright studied at Tuskegee Institute and was a devotee of Booker She had previously led efforts to start schools for African Americans in South Carolina, which were always met with arson and threats of violence. She persisted in her efforts to offer African Americans an opportunity for a better life and, with Voorhees, created an institution that would stand the test of time.  Wright originally taught classes in an old store in Denmark, but, in 1902, New Jersey philanthropist Ralph Voorhees donated money to purchase land and construct a building for the school. A high school at first, Voorhees offered classes at this level for African Americans in the area.  In 1924, the Episcopal Church partnered with Voorhees, and an affiliation with that church continues to this day. The college began to offer junior college degrees in 1947 and 4-year degrees in 1962. While originally founded on the principles of Booker Washington to teach job and trade skills to African Americans, Voorhees now proudly claims to offer a blend of Washington's philosophy and that of Du Bois, who believed a classical liberal arts education was vital to the development of African  The college's recently retired president, Cleveland Sellers, is a Denmark native who graduated from Voorhees High Sellers went on to Howard University, where he became active with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, participating in its 1966 March against  In 1968, after returning to South Carolina, Sellers was arrested and imprisoned for supposedly inciting the confrontation between students and police that became known as the Orangeburg massacre, when police opened fire on students, killing 3 and injuring 27.  Voorhees' College's new president, Franklin Evans, previously served as interim president of my alma mater, South Carolina In that role, he successfully led South Carolina State out of a financial crisis. I sincerely believe that Voorhees College is well-positioned for the future with Evans at its helm.  Denmark Technical College, whose campus is adjacent to Voorhees, was originally a branch of the South Carolina Trade School It was created in 1948 by the South Carolina General Assembly and mandated to provide trade skills to African During the ``separate but equal'' era, Denmark Tech was one of the few opportunities for trade school education offered to African Americans by the  In the early 1960s, Governor Fritz Hollings and then-Senator John West led the effort to create the South Carolina Technical College In 1969, the existing trade school in Denmark was transferred into the system and the modern Denmark Technical College was created. Its total enrollment is approximately 2,000, 96 percent of whom are minority students. Denmark Tech continues to provide technical education and trade skills in its assigned region of Bamberg, Barnwell, and Allendale  Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College, like their fellow HBCUs, have made an indelible impact on their communities, South Carolina, and the They have provided generations of African Americans educational opportunities, and I look forward to their continued success.

So they, in 1970, celebrated what they called Black History  Now, 6 years later, President Gerald Ford signed legislation creating Black History When he signed that legislation, he said it was to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black  The Association for the Study of African American Life and History is entrusted with the celebration every year, and it falls upon them to select a theme for each year. This year they have selected the theme which I think is very timely, ``The Crisis in Black Education.'' Having started my professional career as a public school teacher, I totally embrace this particular topic for this year.  Throughout our history, especially post-Civil War history, there has always been a focus on Black education. As we all know, slaves were not allowed to be educated, and, as a result, when the Civil War came to a close, there was this big push to get the former slaves educated.  One of the leaders of that push was one of my heroes, Robert Robert Smalls, though he was not allowed to be educated himself because he was born into slavery, used his God-given intellect to study the currents of the Charleston Harbor and to study the whistles that were used on the ship that he was working on as a slave. He decided that he could, at some point, find his way to freedom.  Because he learned those currents so well, and because he became very proficient at studying the sounds of the whistles on the ships, one night, when the opportunity presented itself, he absconded The Planter that he was working on, navigated the waters out of the Charleston Harbor, picked up his wife and friends, and sailed them into freedom. And when he delivered that ship to the Union soldiers, he was rewarded with his freedom and a cash award.  Robert Smalls, after the war, went back to Beaufort and, in 1867, founded a school to educate the newly freed slaves. He also participated as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention, and in that Convention, he authored and got passed a resolution that created the first free public schools for all in  He turned his wealth--or his financial reward into great wealth. And also, he became a very, I would say, successful politician. He served 10 years in the South Carolina Legislature and a total of 10 years here in this House of  While he was participating in politics, Robert Smalls authored a piece of legislation that created what is now South Carolina State Therein lies a part of my presentation I would like to concentrate on tonight.  When South Carolina State University was created--I want to first get people to understand, there are more than 100 Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country. Now, there is a difference between--we commonly call them There is a difference between an HBCU and what we call an MSI, a Minority Serving All HBCUs are MSIs, but not all MSIs are HBCUs, simply because the definition means that you must have been in existence before 1964.

I often spend a lot of time with friends, many of whom are graduates of HBCUs, and I knew Astronaut Ronald McNair very well. I have a good friend, a cardiologist, recently retired, David I also have a friend, a California businesswoman who I interact with quite a bit, Janice All three of these people graduated from North Carolina A&T State  I have talked a lot with another former Member, Carrie Meek, a former Member of Congress; her son, Kendrick Meek; former Congresswoman Corrine Brown; and the chairman of the board of Microsoft, John All four of these individuals are graduates of Florida A&M University, an These are people who have made significant and are making significant contributions in our thrust toward a more perfect union.  I came before this body several times the week before last highlighting some of the HBCUs that are in my congressional district. Of the more than 100 in the country, 8 of them are in South Seven are in my congressional district. I talked about six of them when I came before this body before. Tonight I want to close out my discussion of these HBCUs by talking about two of them, Claflin University and South Carolina State University, both located adjacent to each other in Orangeburg, South                              {time}  2100  Now, Claflin University was founded in 1869, by Methodist missionaries to provide education for newly freed slaves in order to prepare them for full citizenship. The university was named for William Claflin, then-Governor of Massachusetts, and his father, Lee Claflin, both prominent abolitionists and They provided a large portion of the funds needed to purchase the land for the campus. Claflin is the oldest Historically Black College in South In its beginning, it had a law school which was headed by former South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Jonathan Jasper Wright, the first African American to serve on South Carolina's highest court.  In 1948, under the leadership of its first alumnus to serve as president, John Seabrook, Claflin was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and It has always featured a strong music program, and the Claflin University collegiate choir performed at the 1965 World's Fair in New Claflin graduate and Kingstree, South Carolina native, Henry Tisdale has served as the university's president since 1994. Under his leadership, Claflin has thrived and grown to new heights. He has built Claflin to an enrollment of almost 2,000 students and consistently seen it ranked in the top 10 nationally for In 1999, through funds from the HBCU Historic Preservation program by this body, the historic Ministers' Hall was restored.  The auditorium at Ministers' Hall was named for former Chief Justice Ernest Finney, one of Claflin's most notable graduates. Finney graduated from South Carolina State's law school and would go on to serve on the South Carolina Supreme Court from 1985 through 2000, including 6 years as Chief Early in his career, Ernest Finney represented the Friendship 9, a group of Rock Hill students who were jailed in 1961 for a sit-in in McCrory's lunch counter. In 2015, Finney represented the surviving eight members of this group to see their convictions overturned--54 years after they were originally prosecuted.  Claflin is still affiliated with the United Methodist Church and offers multiple master's degrees, as well as a highly regarded honors program. For 148 years, Claflin has been a beacon of[[Page H1349]]hope and a place of refuge for those who desired a quality education regardless of race and/or gender.  Mr.Speaker, the final HBCU in this series is my alma mater, South Carolina State South Carolina State University has its roots in the Morrill Acts, the first of which was passed by Congress in 1862. The Morrill Act of 1862 created land grant colleges, a system of agriculture, science, and engineering and military science schools. One of the schools established under this law was Clemson But after Reconstruction ended, Southern States refused to admit African Americans to these institutions; consequently, Congress passed a second Morrill Act in 1890, which stipulated that Blacks must be included in the land grant system. Southern States had the choice to either admit Blacks to the 1862 institutions or create new land grant institutions which would be open to  In South Carolina, by the 1890s, White supremacists had gained total control over State government. Though the State was still majority African American, through illegal and violent intimidation, extreme voter suppression, and outright fraud, Benjamin Tillman was elected Governor in 1890. The Constitutional Convention of 1895 subsequently codified White supremacy and the disenfranchisement of African Americans into the State's system of governance. When the United States Supreme Court sanctioned segregation the following year in Plessy v. Ferguson, segregation was firmly the law of the land.  This was the context for the founding, in 1896, of the Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina, as South Carolina State was originally named. The State of South Carolina continued to resist but relented when land was acquired from Claflin University, and the campus of what is now known as South Carolina State University was born. It continues to be the only publicly supported HBCU in South  Now, I know, Mr.Speaker, that I have consumed a lot of time, and I don't want to take all of the time from my colleagues, so let me just close by saying this: South Carolina State's first president was a man named Thomas Miller who served as a Member of this body. Thomas Miller guided the school for several years. Notable graduates of this institution are folks like Benjamin Mays, the noted president of Morehouse  South Carolina State has a reputation as producing more African-American general officers than any other school in this country. I entered South Carolina State in 1957, and, of course, I was there during the turbulent sixties. It was my great honor to help organize the first sit-in in South You talk about grassroots. That took place on March 15, 1960. Now, I was jailed as a result of that sit-in, but it just so happens that sometimes good things can come out of jail. While I was there, a young lady came to bring food. I was so grateful for that hamburger she gave me, I married her 18 months later, and if all goes well, come June 24, she and I will celebrate our 56th wedding anniversary.  Now, when all of these cases took place growing out of these demonstrations and sit-ins, one stands out which I will close with. I mentioned Kent State in 1968, Jackson State, and South Carolina A lot of people have heard of Kent Few people know about the deaths of three students and the injuries of 27 others in an incident called the Orangeburg massacre that took place in 1968, all over the integration of a bowling alley.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to close my comments by thanking the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for giving me this opportunity and the gentleman from Texas and thank them very much for highlighting Black History  Mr.Speaker, it is impossible for me to really share the real impact that schools like Claflin, South Carolina State, and the over 100 other HBCUs have had on our great country.

We do get along up here, amazingly enough. People think that we all just fight all the time and we have nothing no common. There are some big issues that do divide us, and that is why you have competitive elections with two parties and two different debates. But most folks up here get along, and are friends, and we do have legislation that we can work on, and this is one of those places where Mr.Collins and Mr.Goodlatte and other members of the Judiciary Committee worked with me and others to bring this bill to the floor.  The Equal Access to Justice Act will allow Americans to recover attorneys' fees and costs when they win a lawsuit against the Federal This will enable ordinary citizens, veterans, seniors, small business owners, advocates for clean air and clean water, et cetera, to fight unfair or illegal government actions without fear of having to pay court costs and without fear of having attorneys' fees that they otherwise might not be able to afford.  The law has been a success. However, in 1995, an important reporting requirement was removed from the law, and it made it harder for the public to see how much money the government had awarded. Our bill, H.1033, the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act, restores the law's tracking and reporting requirements of payments awarded so the American people can have access to this important information. It will do this by requiring the group called ACUS, an acronym, which we have too many of up here, but this one is the Administrative Conference of the United States, a highly respected nonpartisan agency which was greatly championed by Justice Scalia, to post in an online database the fees and costs awarded in these cases. The database would also include the number and nature of the claims involved. The availability of this information will help keep the public informed and help Congress to conduct better oversight.  I thank my Judiciary Committee colleague, Doug Collins from Georgia, for his partnership on the bill. I would like to thank Representatives Schrader and Collin Peterson for their support for this bill on our side of the aisle, as well as Jason Chaffetz, Liz Cheney, Paul Gosar, and Raul Labrador on the Republican side, as well as Chairman  And I would like to recall the work of our former colleague, Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis, who had this bill in the past, and we worked together to try to make it a bipartisan effort and pass it.

And while she is no longer here, she is truly in a better place, Wyoming, I think it is, a nice place.

73,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, last week, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of two important measures. First, the resolution provides for consideration of H.428, the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee, and provides for a motion to recommit.  In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.42, providing for congressional disapproval of a rule issued by the Department of Labor with regard to drug testing. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and provides for a motion to recommit.  Mr.Speaker, H.428 is a product of months of negotiation between the States of Texas and Oklahoma and the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Tribes in my district. I am happy to have been able to work with my friend Mr.Thornberry to come up with a fair and equitable solution which all interested parties have agreed to.  As you may know, the Red River serves as the State line separating Oklahoma and Over time, the river has moved, as much as a mile in some areas, causing landowners' properties to be affected. Instead of working to resolve this, for nearly a century, the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, has been unwilling to survey a small portion of the Federal land along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River between Oklahoma and H.428 would direct the survey to be completed, using the gradient boundary survey method that was mandated by the Supreme Court, so that ownership of the land, which has been under dispute, can be effectively resolved.                              {time}  1315  In addition, Mr.Speaker, the rule provides for the consideration of another Congressional Review Act resolution, which would overturn a Department of Labor rule related to drug testing for those applying for unemployment insurance.  In 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made a number of reforms to the unemployment insurance program, including overturning a 1960s-era Department of Labor ban on the screening or testing of unemployment applicants for illegal drugs. The 2012 provision allowed, but did not require, States to test unemployment insurance applicants who either, one, lost their jobs due to drug use or, two, who were seeking new jobs that generally required new employees to pass a drug test. Unfortunately, after 4 years and a now finalized rule, States are no closer to being able to implement this sensible policy. Instead, because of the Department of Labor's overreach, three States which have enacted necessary State law changes to implement this commonsense policy are actually now precluded from moving forward with this sensible, bipartisan policy.  Mr.Speaker, most States already limit unemployment insurance benefits or individuals who refuse to take or fail an employer drug test or who have previous employment issues with drugs. We should empower States, employers, and prospective employees who are looking for work and overturn this onerous regulation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1145.txt,2259,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 428, RED RIVER GRADIENT BOUNDARY",2017.0,14.0,February
75,topic-id,1127,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Obviously, the gentleman and I have some disagreement here, but let's talk for a minute about the form of what we are doing.  The gentleman is correct in that this rule covers two different pieces of legislation that don't have anything substantive in common. However, the legislation itself will be debated separately. We will have one debate on the Oklahoma-Texas issue, which involves the boundary between those two States and the tribal interests that are also intimately part of that. We will have a separate debate on the rule. That is the appropriate way to proceed. There is no reason to have a separate rule for each one of these debates, but it is appropriate, as the gentleman suggested, to have two different debates because they are two different subjects.  I am going to disagree with him--and I am probably being parochial in this sense--for, if you live in Oklahoma, we actually think the border between Oklahoma and Texas is pretty important. This is an issue that, frankly, was dealt with legislatively last year. This body did not vote out the bill. I actually opposed it last year because it did not take care of the tribal interests involved and they had not been suitably dealt with. We amended the bill. Actually, I should say it was brought up, but it was not taken up by the We changed it, but we kept working for many months. Chairman Thornberry is the person who deserves most of the credit here of trying to bring the parties together.  Also, just by way of explanation so everybody is clear, this does not settle the issue. This doesn't force anything on the Federal Government or the two States or the tribes. It simply creates a common database. The two States have been asking for a complete survey of the contested area for many years. The BLM has refused to do that. You simply can't sort through this problem of a shifting border--set well over a century ago--with conflicting tribal interests if you don't have a common set of data here. So that is all that is being done here.  I can assure you that, certainly, the tribes in question would not have consented to go forward if they had thought they were having a solution imposed on them. What they think they are getting is a database that will allow them to determine exactly what their interests and rights here are and, hopefully, negotiate that with the two States in question; but, if necessary, they will litigate the issue.                              {time}  1330  So we see this as a reasonable effort to bring parties together where there is a great deal of confusion through nobody's fault. And we think the BLM has been lax here and, frankly, may well be claiming things beyond its authority. But the survey, again, will hopefully take care of that. So I hope that eases the concerns that people have.[[Page H1147]]  In terms of the drug rule, we see this as an issue where Congress made its intent in 2012 very clear, that is, we wanted States to have options to make these decisions for themselves. We think the Department of Labor rule made that more, rather than less, difficult.  We can argue over the merits of any individual treatment of people that have used illegal drugs or what the appropriate testing measure is or whatever. I happen to think those decisions are best made at the State level where you have got interested parties that are more knowledgeable about local conditions than us dictating a one size fits all. So we just simply disagree on that.  Finally, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Hastings) mentioned some concerns about the speed with which we are acting and also the form with which we are acting. The form, frankly, is basically dictated by statute.  The Congressional Review Act dictates the manner in which we can bring these items on rules to the floor, the timetable which we can operate under. If we alter that over here, then, frankly, we lose privilege status in the Senate and the chances of succeeding actually diminish pretty greatly.  We think, in this case, the issues are pretty clear. These aren't really things that need to be amended. We need to decide whether or not the regulation is appropriate or not. If you think it is, you should vote in favor of keeping the regulation as it is and against this effort.  If, on the other hand, you would like to see decisionmaking devolve down to the States and where we think better decisions will be made, then, you should vote in favor of the rule and the underlying legislation.  So, again, I don't think these issues are overly complex. I do think this is an important time to deal with them. Again, we have a limited period of time on the Congressional Review We have a certain format. We think we are abiding within both that timeframe and that format.  On the Oklahoma-Texas border issue, it is a knotty issue. It has been around for decades. There have been multiple efforts to deal with it. Most of them have faltered because we have not had the various parties arguing from a common database as to what their positions are. We have asked the Bureau of Land Management repeatedly to survey the affected area. They decided they didn't want to do that.  In this case, Congress says: Look, we have two sovereign States and three sovereign Indian tribes here that have a concern. We want them to be able to work it through. We want them to draw on a common set of data. So we are going to essentially make sure that that happens and hopefully we can avoid a protracted court case between the States and the Indian tribes and actually resolve an issue that needs to be had.  There are literally thousands of people along this border that are not certain whether or not they own the land that they have actually been farming, in some cases, for generations. There are three Indian tribes that have historic rights to this land that predate, frankly, the existence of Texas as a State and certainly the existence of Oklahoma as a They want to make sure their mineral rights issues and their land issues are appropriately handled, and they want to preserve their rights going forward if they want to litigate. Again, they need this kind of data to make those sorts of determinations.  I commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Thornberry). I, again, look forward to working with my good friend from Florida (Mr.Hastings) on these issues.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

None of it had very much to do with the rule or with the underlying legislation that we are going to discuss shortly, so I don't pretend to be an expert on the issues.  I do point out, simply in passing, that it really is up to the President of the United States as to whose advice he or she wants to take. Frankly, you know, to say that there aren't ``political people on the National Security Agency,'' with all due respect to a Chief of Staff that I admire profoundly, I think Leon Panetta is one of the great Chiefs of Staff to ever serve any President, but I would tell you that he is a pretty political guy. He was in this body, and one of his jobs was to help make sure the President of the United States was reelected. So there was a political dimension to what he did.  I don't know Mr.I have never met him. I don't pretend to be familiar with him or his thinking. I do know that he is a valued adviser to the President of the United And if the President of the United States is going to seek advice from somebody--and it may be in these areas of national security--frankly, personally, I would prefer them to be part of the National Security Council, simply to have the educated debate of some of the very best professionals that we have and so that their opinion, when they advise the President, is fully formed. Again, I see this as the President's decision, not some enormous departure.  On occasions, Mr.Axelrod, who was not a chief of staff who was primarily a political counsel, did sit in on national security meetings at the request of the So, again, we can have this argument. I am not sure it is particularly relevant to the legislation. But at the end of the day, I want anybody advising the President of the United States--and he gets to make that choice--to get the best information they can possibly receive so that that advice is well-informed.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Carter), who is here to offer some important thoughts about some of the issues that are involved in the underlying legislation.

81,topic-id,413,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I just want to point out for the record, Mr.Speaker, that actually this rule that we are trying to repeal, the measure we are trying to instate, doesn't force drug testing on anybody; and that is not going to happen in any State, unless the people in the State decide that that is something they want to do. I am quite content to let people in any State make that decision.  I think in my State, I am pretty certain that the people who I am privileged to represent would be very upset if they thought somebody was receiving unemployment compensation while they were on drugs, because they think[[Page H1149]]that is going to make it pretty hard for that person to ever get back into the workforce, and they want to be able to identify that. They don't want to incentivize it.  Other people may have a different opinion, and that is legitimate. It is a big country. That is why our Founding Fathers adopted a Federal system, so I wouldn't begrudge another State that saw it differently.  What we are trying to avoid here is a one-size-fits-all or this body and any administration dictating to every State what they ought to do.  Frankly, I would suggest that my good friend's remarks suggest that is the concern, that they actually want to decide in Oklahoma what we would do.

Again, that is part of the genius of our system, having 50 different laboratories out there.  But let's not have a bureaucracy decide that it will circumvent the will of the Congress of the United States and write a rule that is clearly meant to undo the intent of a legislation that was passed across this floor with bipartisan support.

85,topic-id,622,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to point out again that, while my friend is correct, we have two different pieces of legislation under a single rule, and those legislations, as my friend points out, are not particularly related. As a matter of fact, they are not related to one another in any way. Each piece of legislation will receive a separate debate and a separate vote on the House floor. There was simply no reason to have two rules when one would suffice for two bills that basically need to come into the same format, in our view.  I also point out that, when we are talking about the vote under the Congressional Review Act, we are actually following a form prescribed in statute, and we are moving at a pace that the law dictates and that, frankly, is necessary in order to retain the privileged status of the legislation in the United States So nothing unusual here, other than we are actually being pretty productive and undoing a lot of rules that, frankly, we think were misguided and rushed into the final days of the last administration.  My friends are free to disagree with that, but I think the issues are pretty clear, pretty easy to decide, and don't require a great deal of amendments.  On the Oklahoma-Texas issue, and that is something I know a little bit about since it affects my district, last year, when we considered this legislation, we actually did have an amendment. It was my amendment, and my amendment that probably made it unacceptable in the But I was indulged by my chairman of the Rules Committee, and for the very important reason that we actually make sure that the tribes have an opportunity to be at the table. In this case, they do.  Mr.Thornberry has worked very hard, and so there is no dispute between the delegations in Oklahoma, the delegations in Texas, the interests of the various Indian tribes. Everybody agrees that we need a common set of information, a common survey that we can all trust to, frankly, work out the differences here that have multiplied over a century as the border has literally shifted. So that is the appropriate thing to do. We don't need a lot of amendments on that.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. H.428 is a fair and equitable solution which all interested parties have agreed upon and which can provide certainty that many landowners have sought along the Oklahoma-Texas border.  In addition, H.42 undoes a regulation that should have never been made in the first place. By preventing implementation of this regulation, we can ensure that those actively looking for work are provided with the support necessary to reach that goal.

530,topic-id,292,"Mr.President, I rise in support of H.40, a resolution of disapproval of the rule submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to the implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. The rule in question would require the Social Security Administration to send to the Attorney General the names of certain beneficiaries for inclusion in the NICS background check database and would make it illegal for these beneficiaries to own or possess a firearm.  In matters where the government is promulgating regulations limiting the Constitutional rights of Americans, it is especially important that the regulations be drafted carefully. I am concerned that this rule targets individuals with mental illness without requiring the Social Security Administration to determine that the individuals whose rights are being limited are dangerous either to themselves or others. As a result, this rule inadvertently reinforces an unfortunate and inaccurate stereotype that suggests that most individuals with mental illness are violent.  Rather than focus on whether the beneficiary presents a danger, the rule instead turns on beneficiaries' ability to manage their finances. Because of this, the rule includes a test that could lead to absurd and unfair results. Under the rule, two individuals could present the exact same condition and symptoms, but if one of them required assistance with their financial affairs, that person would be reported to the NICS background check system, while the other would not.  I hope that the Social Security Administration will consider these suggestions as well as the comments from my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, and others, and promulgate a new rule. Addressing these concerns would result in a more effective rule, consistent with Constitutional requirements, which would make Americans safer while protecting the rights of those living with mental illness.

I also have reviewed testimony from his confirmation hearing.

At times, the Agency has been difficult to work with and unresponsive to bipartisan congressional concerns, but the EPA plays a vital role in implementing and enforcing landmark laws that protect not only our environment but also public health.  Specifically, I have significant concerns that Mr.Pruitt has actively opposed and sued EPA on numerous issues that are of great importance to the State of Maine, including mercury controls for coal-fired power plants and efforts to reduce cross-State air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. His actions leave me with considerable doubts about whether his vision for the EPA is consistent with the Agency's critical mission to protect human health and the environment.  The State of Maine, located at the end of our Nation's ``air pollution tailpipe,'' is on the receiving end of pollution generated by coal-fired power plants in other Reducing harmful air pollutants is critical for public health, particularly for Maine, which has among the highest rates of asthma in the country. Controls for mercury, one of the most persistent and dangerous pollutants, are especially important for children and pregnant women. Moreover, there is no doubt that the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change pose a significant threat to our State's economy and our natural resources, from our working forests, fishing, and agricultural industries, to tourism and recreation.  The opposition to the nominee expressed by Friends of Acadia is grounded in concerns about the importance of emissions reductions for lessening the impacts of climate change that affect this gem of a national park. The changes we are already seeing in the aquatic life in Casco Bay and the Gulf of Maine, for example, are cause for alarm. The incidence of Lyme disease in northern Maine and high asthma rates throughout the State are also linked to environmental changes that threaten the health and well-being of too many Maine people.[[Page S1217]]  These are among the reasons why I have voted to uphold the EPA rule governing mercury and air toxics standards from coal-fired power plants and the cross-State air pollution rule, as well as the Clean Power Plan to limit carbon pollution from existing and new fossil fuel-fired power plants.  I reject the false choice of pitting the environment against the economy because, for much of the State of Maine, the economy and the environment are inextricably linked. A strong commitment to protecting the health of our Nation's environment is critical for protecting Maine's natural beauty, the State's economy, and the health of those of us fortunate enough to call Maine home.  Due to my concerns about Mr.Pruitt's commitment to the mission of the EPA, I will cast my vote in opposition to his confirmation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1216-3.txt,2121,CELEBRATING NATIONAL COURT REPORTING AND CAPTIONING WEEK,2017.0,15.0,February
1713,topic-id,949,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act, which I have introduced with my friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Our legislation aims to help ensure that our seniors and disabled citizens have timely access to home health services available under the Medicare program.  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of healthcare services, particularly in rural and medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be in scarce supply.  In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in 1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services provided by those health professionals as long as those services are within their scope of practice under State law.  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home healthcare services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only physicians are allowed to certify or initiate home healthcare for Medicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the patient's case as the nonphysician provider.  In fact, in many cases, the certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the patient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home healthcare. At best, this requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps to the process before home healthcare can be provided. At worst, it can lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home care that they need simply because a doctor is not readily available to sign the requisite form. The inability of these advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for our seniors in medically underserved areas, where these providers may be the only healthcare professionals who are readily available.  For example, needed home healthcare can be delayed for up to days at a time for Medicare patients in some rural towns in my State of Maine, where nurse practitioners are the only healthcare professionals and the supervising physicians are far away. A nurse practitioner told me about one of her cases in which her collaborating physician had just lost her father and, therefore, understandably, was not available. But here is what the consequence was. This nurse practitioner's patients experienced a 2-day delay in getting needed care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another doctor.  Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ludicrous that she can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute facility but cannot order home healthcare. How does that make sense?  One of her patients had to wait 11 days after being discharged before his physical and occupational therapy could continue simply because the home health agency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation of the very same therapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to authorize when the patient was in the facility.  Think about that. Here we have a patient who is in a rehab facility, for example, or a subacute facility or a nursing home--a skilled nursing home--and that patient is ready to go home, but the chances of successful treatment of that patient--of that patient regaining function--is going to be diminished if there is a gap between the physical and occupational therapy and the home healthcare nursing that the patient would receive at home if there is no physician available to do the paperwork.  So that simply does not make sense. I would wager that it leads to additional cost for our healthcare system because, if that essential home healthcare is not available in the patient's home, the tendency is going to be to keep the patient in the facility for a longer period of time to avoid the gap in treatment. Yet we know that it is much more cost effective to treat the patient in his or her home. We also know that for many patients, that is their preference as well. They would rather be in the comfort, security, and privacy of their own home.  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act would help ensure that our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care they need and when they need it, by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives to order home health services.  It only makes sense. They can order it when the patient is in certain facilities, but then they lose the right to order it when the patient goes home? That just doesn't make sense. These are skilled professionals who know what the patients need, and we should not be burdening the system with unnecessary paperwork.  Our bipartisan legislation is supported by the National Association for Home Care & Hospice, the American Nurses Association, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American College of Nurse Midwives, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, and the Visiting Nurse Associations of  A lot of times we deal with healthcare issues that are extraordinarily complex, and it is difficult for us to figure out what the answer is. This is not one of those cases. This is a commonsense reform that will improve and expedite services to Medicare beneficiaries, whether they are our disabled citizens or our seniors. It will help them get the home health care they need without undue delay.  I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this commonsense bill.  Seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

992,topic-id,1120,"Mr.President, I want to initially begin by thanking my colleague from Oklahoma for graciously allowing me to proceed first ahead of him. He is, as ever, a terrific colleague. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from I, too, led a bipartisan delegation--two Republican House Members and two Senate Democrats--to Eastern European in August and observed many of the same issues and concerns that she just raised and have joined her, along with 10 Republican Senators and 8 other Democratic Senators, in the legislation she mentioned. I think this is an important issue on which all of us should focus.  Mr.President, let me turn to the matter at hand, the nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as the director of the I thank my colleagues, many of whom have come to the floor to speak about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, and most essentially, my senior Senator and friend from my home State of Delaware, Tom Carper, ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who has ably led this fight.  I am glad to be able to join my colleagues to make clear why, in my view, someone who does not believe in a core Federal role in protecting the environment is not the right person to lead the Federal Agency charged with just that mission. It is possible that we in this Chamber have now forgotten why the Environmental Protection Agency was created in the first place. The idea of Federal protection of our environment really started to take hold when the Cuyahoga River caught fire, again, in June of 1969. The public outrage that rightfully followed this near-spontaneous combustion of a river helped lead to the EPA's creation in 1970 and the passage of the Clean Air Act the same year and the Clean Water Act in 1972.  Now, nearly a half century later, it is precisely because these laws and others like them have been successful in making us healthier and safer that it is easy to forget why we need them.  Institutions like the EPA don't run themselves. The environment does not protect itself, and big oil and gas and coal companies certainly don't police themselves. That is why the EPA exists. You would certainly hope that at the very least the Administrator of that Agency would support that core mission. Yet this evening we are considering the nomination of someone whose main experience with environmental protection at the Federal level is filing lawsuits against the Federal Environmental Protection  In fact, he has filed 14 of those lawsuits in just 6 years as attorney general of the State of That is not all he has done. Scott Pruitt, in his confirmation hearing, refused to recuse himself from consideration of future cases which he brought against the EPA if confirmed.  Mr.Pruitt has also suggested that Senators who want more information about the details of his record should file FOIA requests rather than providing that information voluntarily. He has described himself as ``a leading advocate against the Federal EPA's activist agenda.'' Scott Pruitt has not been able to name in confirmation hearings one single environmental protection statute he supports. In my view, that is unacceptable for a State attorney general let alone someone nominated to be our Nation's highest ranking environmental protection official.  Mr.Pruitt's disdain for the core mission of the EPA leaves me without a doubt that he is unfit to take on this important role, but that is not all. Scott Pruitt either ignores or is ignorant of the core and important science of climate change, mercury, lead exposure, ocean acidification, to name just a few of many topics uncovered in his confirmation hearing.  Mr.Pruitt acknowledges the climate is changing but says the role, the influence of human activity is ``subject to debate.'' I am here to say this evening, that is simply not true. Only in an alternative universe, based on alternative facts, is the human impact on climate change still subject to debate. That is like saying that Scott Pruitt is fit to lead the EPA is subject to debate. I think after an exhaustive confirmation hearing and a review on the floor of the facts, it is not. It is simply not true.  Scott Pruitt also led a lawsuit against EPA rules that would reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired powerplants. He argued it was too expensive, too burdensome, but he also questioned whether mercury itself was[[Page S1267]]harmful to health. On that issue, the science is clear. Mercury has devastating effects on the development of the human nervous system.  Does Mr.Pruitt not get that or does he not care? Those are pressing questions for me. During his confirmation process, Mr.Pruitt was confused about ocean acidification, a process explained by very basic science. A question I was left with was whether Mr.Pruitt just did not get it or just did not care.  In that same hearing, he made statements that indicated he was unfamiliar with the Federal standards regarding lead in drinking water. I had to ask myself whether he simply has not heard of Flint, MI, or was not concerned.  My office alone has received nearly 1,000 calls and emails from Delawareans expressing concern about Scott Pruitt and the future of the EPA under his potential leadership, expressing concern and opposition. Delawareans have reached out to me saying they are worried about their kids with asthma; they are worried about clean drinking water for their families; they are worried about protecting our rivers, our wetlands, and other outdoor spaces in Delaware and around the country.  With Scott Pruitt potentially at the helm of the EPA, they are right to be worried. Let me end by sharing a brief excerpt of a letter from one of my constituents who lives in my hometown of Wilmington, She wrote:       Please vote against Scott Pruitt as leader of the Our      children's future, their health and well-being, and their      right to inherit a world we have not irreversibly destroyed      may depend on it.

(d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Committee shall accord a      respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends      disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or      before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not      requiring discipline by the full Senate).       (e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COMMITTEE: The Committee staff or      outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee      concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review.

(4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory      review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any,      shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy      shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent.

227,topic-id,1263,"Mr.President, for the last several weeks, we have been doing all we can to take up and consider the President's nominations for his Cabinet, even though we have had little or no cooperation from the other side of the aisle.  Last night, we confirmed the President's top economic adviser--something you would think people would think was pretty important--the Secretary of the Treasury, and we did confirm the President's Secretary of Veterans Ironically, the vote for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs was 100 to 0. So maybe somebody can explain to me what was the necessity of delaying the confirmation of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for 3 weeks, leaving that important agency without a designated and Senate-confirmed head?  Earlier today, we considered the nomination of Linda McMahon to serve as the next head of the Small Business Administration, to help our country's job creators reach their potential. Again, we had an overwhelming vote for Linda McMahon for the So, again, my question is, What purpose is served by delaying, by foot-dragging, and by obstructing the President's choice of his Cabinet members?  We are glad we finally confirmed them, but to be honest, it is not much to celebrate. By carrying out this unprecedented obstruction of qualified nominees, our friends across the aisle are simply precluding the Senate from considering other acts of legislation that would actually be helpful to the American people. From my vantage point, it is pretty clear. While they are headed down this self-destructive path, our friends continue to listen and, sadly, cater to radical elements of their own party that simply haven't gotten over the election and have decided to obstruct the President and his agenda at all cost.  But we know for a fact, from our private conversations, that our Democrat friends are not--well, they are fractured. Some of them remembered what happened in 2014, when, under the leadership of then-Majority Leader Reid, essentially everybody was frozen out of offering legislation or amendments to legislation on the floor, including Members of the majority party--then, Democrats, at the time. That strategy really backfired, resulting in a huge Republican class of outstanding Senators in 2014.  People don't like that across the country. They think we are sent here to solve problems, and we work together and make progress on behalf of the American people. This sort of mindless obstruction or foot-dragging for foot-dragging's sake doesn't make any sense to them, and it doesn't make any sense to me either.  Now, I realize the minority leader--the Democratic leader--probably has the toughest job in Washington, DC--to try to keep the far left fringes of his party happy, while trying to do the work of the American people who sent us here to legislate. I do know that there are Members of the Democratic caucus who are very interested in trying to demonstrate their effectiveness by working on bipartisan legislation. Some of them happen to be running for election in 2018 in States carried by President You would think they would be incentivized to tell the leadership of their own party--or the far left of their party, which wants to do nothing but resist the Trump agenda and our bipartisan agenda in the Senate--to stand down or that they are not going to participate in that sort of mindless obstruction, because I think their enlightened self-interest tells them that not only is this what the American people sent us to do--to be productive on a bipartisan basis--but it is also in their electoral self-interest, as well.  As long as the Democratic leader caters to the fringe of his own party and resists any sort of cooperation, I think they can expect the same sort of results after Senator Reid led his party down that path in 2014. We are now headed into the fourth week of the new administration, and we have only confirmed a handful of this President's Cabinet picks. That is bad news not just for us but for the American people, as well.  Surely, after the election of November 8, when President Obama said he wanted to make sure he participated in a peaceful transition of power to the next administration, he was appealing to the better angels of all of those who perhaps were disappointed by the outcome of the election. But that is what[[Page S1150]]we do as We pull together in the best interest of the entire country. We get together and we fight, perhaps, and we take opposing parties in elections. But once the election is over, after the ballots are counted, we work together in the best interest of the American people.  But that is not happening, and that is really not just bad for the That is bad for the country. Our job in the Senate is to consider these nominees and to move on them so that the President of the United States can be surrounded by the people he has chosen to help him lead the country. I will tell you that I have been incredibly impressed by the quality of people he has selected. So as we begin to consider the remaining nominees put forward by President Trump, I hope our friends on the other side will start to realize the ramifications of their quest to stop the Senate or to drag out these deliberations and preclude us from doing other constructive work.  One thing I can promise you is that, thanks to the efforts of Senator Reid in the last Congress, all of these nominees will be confirmed. Our colleagues face the same choice they have had all along. They can either work with us to help get these advisers vetted and then confirmed, or they can make it painful for all of us for no good reason and reveal to the country just how ineffective they truly are when it comes to trying to obstruct this confirmation process.  My hope is that they will decide to course-correct and determine for the good of the entire country that the right thing to do is to move forward on these nominees. We were able to take up the VA Secretary and the Administrator of the SBA, basically by consent, by agreement, without having to grind through this lengthy process that we are having to do on the Mulvaney and the Pruitt nominations, just to get those done before It is not necessary, and it is not going to change the outcome.  Mr.President, we are also going to take up an important congressional resolution of disapproval. The rule in question allows the Social Security Administration to report folks who may need help managing their money to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, also known as  This is just another chapter in the same story that we heard last year when we successfully pushed back on the Veterans' Administration for trying to do the same thing--bureaucrats unilaterally taking away people's constitutional rights without even notifying them of the reason, much less without giving them an opportunity for a due process hearing. Well, this isn't a small matter. We have to make sure that the bureaucracies can't continue to infringe on fundamental rights guaranteed to all Now we have a chance to repeal this unconstitutional rule and to protect those just trying to receive the Social Security benefits they have earned.  I look forward to doing away with this particularly noxious rule soon, this week.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

242,topic-id,193,"Mr.President, I agree with my friend and colleague from If the Social Security Administration were to amend the rule to include the front-end due process and a finding of dangerous mental illness, that would be a fundamentally different rule that is not substantially similar.  Under the current rule, merely filing for a disability benefit on the grounds of a condition, for example, like anxiety can trigger a permanent deprivation of constitutional rights without any physician or adjudicative body finding the person is dangerously mentally ill.  I certainly agree with the concerns raised by my friend and our colleague from Pennsylvania that the rule he is describing would not be substantially similar to the rule currently in effect and that would be no bar to the Social Security Administration writing a substitute rule in accordance with the views he has expressed.  There may still be a few differences between us in terms of what exactly the rule would be, but there is no distance between us in terms of the conclusion that a replacement rule that provides for due process would not be substantially similar and would not be barred under the Congressional Review  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1149-2.txt,1692,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,14.0,February

553,topic-id,880,"Mr.President, earlier today the Senate moved forward with the President's nominee to head up the Office of Management and Budget, Congressman Congressman Mulvaney spent years representing the people of South Carolina and has been thoroughly engaged on budget issues during his time in the House of  He has highlighted the fact that the Federal Government is on an unsustainable fiscal path if nothing changes in Washington, DC, and that it is reckless to keep running up the Nation's credit card with trillions in more debt and unfunded liabilities, not to mention the immorality of passing down to the next generation the obligation of actually paying that money back.  So Congressman Mulvaney is actually, I think, a very good choice for this critical role, and I look forward to voting on his confirmation soon.                                 Trade  Mr.President, I want to weigh in briefly on the issue of trade. During the Presidential campaign and since then, there has been a lot of talk about international trade. It has led to a healthy debate about lopsided trade deals--whether bilateral trade deals or multinational trade deals actually are better--and how best to leverage trade to help American workers and consumers.  In my State of Texas, there is no question trade delivers in two ways. One, it helps Texas families stretch their paychecks by providing greater access to more affordable goods. That is a good thing. And two, it helps our farmers, our ranchers, our small businesses, and other manufacturers access more customers around the world.  Texas continues to lead the Nation as the top exporting State, and it has done so for about a decade now. It is one reason our economy has done better than the national economy in recent years. And it is estimated that Texas trade supports more than 1 million jobs currently.  But it is important to understand that our economic partnership with Mexico has been a key part of that success, and that is thanks, in part, to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, the trade deal between the United States, Mexico, and  Our southern neighbor is our largest export market, with more than one-third of all Texas goods--including ag products and manufactured goods, to the tune of close to $92 billion a year--heading south of our border because of NAFTA and trade. Well, this may not be universally true around the country, but suffice it to say that in Texas, NAFTA has been a big success for our economy. And because Texas has been leading the Nation in terms of economic growth and job creation, I think it is fair to say that it has helped the Nation as a whole not recede into a recession with the anemic growth rates that we have seen since 2008.  It is not just that my State benefits from the deal. The agriculture industry across the country benefits greatly. Mexico is one of the biggest buyers of crops grown in the United States, like corn. In fact, Mexico is the third biggest export market for American agriculture.  NAFTA is not just critical to my State, but for those far away from the southern border, as well, like Ohio and Michigan, which export a majority of their goods to NAFTA partners. I think it is important to acknowledge the fact that roughly 6 million jobs in the United States depend on bilateral trade with  But here is the truth: The world looks a lot different today than it did 20 years ago when NAFTA was negotiated, and there is ample opportunity to work with our partners to craft a better deal for the United We can update it to be even more constructive and an even bigger driver of the U.economy.  Trade is essential to our economy, and I believe the administration agrees with me on that. In my conversations with Mr.Ross, who will head up the Department of Commerce, and others--the trade negotiator and the like--they all tell me that this administration is pro-trade, although they are skeptical of large multinational trade deals like the Trans-Pacific  We have also recently heard the President himself talk about the importance of our relationships with countries like Canada and During the visits of the Prime Ministers of[[Page S1176]]each of those countries in the last week, with both heads of State, the administration continues to stress the importance of robust trading partnerships. And the President has made it clear that he supports those.  I believe that good trade deals help everyone, so I want to be clear that the United States is not retreating from the global economy, as if we even could. With more than 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of our borders, our citizens rely too much on free trade and fair trade to turn inward and retreat.  Texas certainly proves that trade deals can help everyone from manufacturers to farmers, to small businesses, all of whom find more markets for the goods they make or grow. That, in turn, creates more jobs and provides greater access to more goods for consumers. And it is a good example for the broader U.economy as well.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

979,topic-id,1910,"Mr.President, today is February 16, 2017. President Trump was sworn in on January 20, 2017.  For the past several weeks now, we have come to the floor and talked about the slow pace at which the Senate has considered and voted on the President's nominees for his Well, there is good reason for that because one of our roles is to consider and vote on advisers selected by the President, regardless of political party, and to help this new administration lead the country.  President Obama, to his credit, after the election, sat down with President-Elect Trump and said he was committed to a peaceful transition of power from his administration to the Trump administration. But, apparently, some of our colleagues didn't get the memo. We continue to slog along at the slowest pace since George Washington to vote on nominees to the President's  The reason it has gone on so slowly is clear by now. It is because our friends across the aisle are still upset and have not yet reconciled themselves with the results of the election on November 8. They just kind of can't get over it. Yes, they are being encouraged by the radical elements of their party who don't want us to fulfill our responsibilities, who don't want a new President to have the Cabinet that he needs in order to govern the country. Yes, there are some who want to halt our work in this Chamber and perpetuate dysfunction. They don't want us to focus on legislating because they want to keep us tied up in the confirmation process.  I will just interject right here, as I have said before, that we know these nominees will be confirmed because, thanks to the nuclear option under Senator Reid, the previous Democratic leader, all it takes is 51 votes to confirm a nominee to a Cabinet post. But the fact is, the country needs a functioning We need a functioning executive branch.  So I hope our colleagues across the aisle will understand soon that if they want to be effective--if they want to actually move the needle and help those who have entrusted them with the future of this country--then we need to turn from gridlock to action.  Last Congress, even under President Obama in the White House, we did not let partisan dysfunction keep us from working together. There is a difference between elections and governing. But, for some reason, too many people want to keep relitigating the election and not allow us to actually govern.  Of course, during the Obama administration, Republicans had many points of departure from the Obama administration, and we used the tools available to us to provide the oversight and ask the critical questions that the American people demanded. But our friends across the aisle are now being tempted to shut down the government, to run away from policy debates, and point fingers. Why? Because it is always easier to throw stones than it is to actually accomplish something--roll up your sleeves, focus on the task, and turn to legislating.  Yes, it may be easier just to criticize and to obstruct, but it is not the right thing for the American people. Our colleagues across the aisle know that, but, as I said earlier, they are being unduly influenced by some of the radical elements in their political base who will not let them do it or who say that if you do cooperate on a bipartisan basis and actually do your job, then we are going to recruit people to run against you in a primary.  Well, that is part of the risk we all take. We didn't come here to appease a portion of our political base and neglect our most basic duties as Members of the U.Again, I would point to last Congress and the work we did together on a bipartisan basis, I might add, as evidence of what you can accomplish when you try to do that.  The 114th Congress, after the 2014 election, saw a new majority, a new Republican leadership, and we did our best to help restore order to this Chamber and get it working again after years of dysfunction. Under the previous regime, Members of both the majority and minority parties were actually prevented from coming to the floor and offering legislative ideas in the form of amendments and getting votes on them, but that backfired when some of our colleagues who were running for reelection in 2014 realized that they had very little to show the voters by way of accomplishment--even those in the majority party, the Democratic Party, at that time. So one would have thought that there would be some lessons learned there.  In the last Congress--in the 114th Congress that began 2 years ago--we voted on legislative ideas from both sides of the aisle with more than 250 rollcall votes. That represented a sea change from the previous administration and the way Senator Reid ran things.  We were able to get the Senate functioning as the Founders intended, and that led to big results for the American people. We took care of big, intractable problems that had trouble getting anywhere during the previous For example, we passed a transportation bill--the highway bill--to help Americans deal with safety on the roadway, to deal with concerns about pollution due to congestion and people in gridlock, and we helped our economy in the process. That was a big, important bill. That was the first time we had been able to pass a long-term highway bill in about 30 different, separate attempts where we had patched the funding mechanism for 6 months or a year, which made it nearly impossible for our highway departments across the country to actually plan. It actually ended up being more expensive and less effective than it would be with a multiyear highway bill, which we[[Page S1254]]passed. So that was a big bipartisan accomplishment.  We also made great progress in reforming our public education system by passing, again, on a bipartisan basis, the Every Student Succeeds Act, which went a long way to devolving power from here in Washington, DC, back to the States, back to local school districts, back to parents and teachers--something that, fortunately, we were able to agree upon on a bipartisan basis. That change was applauded by my constituents back home, and, I believe, people around the country.  We also made great headway in making our country safer and our government more just by taking up and passing legislation to support victims of abuse and violence and to craft laws to better equip our law enforcement to handle growing threats.  For example, we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act 99 to 0. Some people say that nothing ever gets done in Washington; well, 99 to 0--it is hard to beat that, except by maybe 100 to 0, but we will take it.  That law was signed into law by President Obama 2 years ago, and it is helping victims of human trafficking get the healing and recovery they need, while also providing help to law enforcement to help root out the people who patronize modern day slavery, which is what human trafficking amounts to.  We also, on a bipartisan basis, reauthorized the Justice for All Act to strengthen victims' rights in court and increase access to restitution and services that can help them recover. It helps reduce the national backlog in untested rape kits, forensic evidence collected after a sexual assault that is necessary to identify the assailant through the use of DNA testing. That was really important, after we heard the horror stories of as many as 400,000 untested rape kits in laboratories or evidence lockers--evidence which was critical to identifying the assailant; many times they were serial assailants. In other words, they didn't just attack one time, they attacked multiple times over the years--and to get them off the streets. That type of evidence is also very important in exonerating the innocent because if we can exclude someone from one of these terrible assaults, that means a person who is innocent of the crime will be free.  We also passed a bill called the POLICE Act, signed into law last summer, so our first responders and law enforcement officers can learn the latest techniques to deal with violence so they are ready to face the unimaginable or previously unimaginable threats in our communities.  I could go on and on, but I will just mention a few more. We passed bipartisan legislation to combat opioid abuse and heroin addiction, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery We passed laws to make our government more transparent so it is more accountable to the public and to voters. We helped capitalize on our God-given natural resources by lifting the crude oil export ban, for example--something important not only to domestic producers and job creation here but also to our friends and allies around the world who frequently depend on a single source for their energy. Unfortunately, people like Vladimir Putin in Russia have discovered you can use that sole source of energy as a weapon by threatening to cut it off.  The reason I mention some of these accomplishments is to make the point that nothing happens in Congress, nothing happens in the Federal Government, unless it is bipartisan.  It is one thing to fight hard in an election and try to win the election so you can gain the privilege of actually being in the majority or having the White House, but after the election is over, our responsibilities shift to governing. Right now, our friends across the aisle are continuing to obstruct and drag their feet and make it impossible for the President to get the Cabinet he needs in order to get the government up and running.  We need to return to the pattern we established in the last Congress, to work together, to build consensus, to help make America stronger, our citizens safer, and our laws a better service to all the people. I would plead with our colleagues across the aisle to stop the dysfunction, stop wanting to relitigate the outcome of the election. You can't. It is over. We know what the outcome was. They need to move on, and we need to move on--not just for the political parties we are members of, not just for the benefit of those elected here in Washington but for the benefit of 320-some-odd million people whom we have the responsibility of representing. Instead of foot-dragging, obstruction, and dysfunction, let us fight, as we always have, for those people we represent and work together to find common ground where we can to put forward legislation that serves them well.  I hope our colleagues across the aisle would remember those lessons they learned in the 2014 election; that dysfunction is bad politics. It does not help their political cause. I understand the temptation of wanting to yield to the most radical elements in a political party, but we are elected to the Senate for 6-year terms to be that cooling saucer, to try to have debate and deliberation, to try to work out the hard problems. That is our responsibility, and just to blindly obstruct when you know you can't change the outcome--particularly when it comes to the President getting the Cabinet he has chosen and he deserves--makes no sense whatsoever.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE                          It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) honoring current national space commitments and      building upon investments in space across successive      Administrations demonstrates clear continuity of purpose by      the United States, in collaboration with its international,      academic, and industry partners, to extend humanity's reach      into deep space, including cis-lunar space, the Moon, the      surface and moons of Mars, and beyond;       (2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in the      United States space program by continuing to develop a      balanced portfolio for space exploration and space science,      including continued development of the Space Launch System,      Orion, Commercial Crew Program, space and planetary science      missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Wide-Field      Infrared Survey Telescope, and Europa mission, and ongoing      operations of the ISS and Commercial Resupply Services      Program;       (3) a national, government-led space program that builds on      current science and exploration programs, advances human      knowledge and capabilities, and opens the frontier beyond      Earth for ourselves, commercial enterprise, and science, and      with our international partners, is of critical importance to      our national destiny and to a future guided by United States      values and freedoms;       (4) continuity of purpose and effective execution of core      NASA programs are essential for efficient use of resources in      pursuit of timely and tangible accomplishments;       (5) NASA could improve its efficiency and effectiveness by      working with industry to streamline existing programs and      requirements, procurement practices, institutional footprint,      and bureaucracy while preserving effective program oversight,      accountability, and safety;       (6) it is imperative that the United States maintain and      enhance its leadership in space exploration and space      science, and continue to expand freedom and economic      opportunities in space for all Americans that are consistent      with the Constitution of the United States; and       (7) NASA should be a multi-mission space agency, and should      have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space      science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight      and exploration, and education.     202.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Returns on the Nation's investments in science,      technology, and exploration accrue over decades-long      timeframes, and a disruption of such investments could      prevent returns from being fully realized.       (2) Past challenges to the continuity of such investments,      particularly threats regarding the cancellation of authorized      programs with bipartisan and bicameral support, have      disrupted completion of major space systems thereby--       (A) impeding planning and pursuit of national objectives in      space science and human space exploration;       (B) placing such investments in space science and space      exploration at risk; and       (C) degrading the aerospace industrial base.       (3) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155; 119      2895), National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422; 122      4779), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18301 et seq.) reflect a      broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA's      core missions in science, space technology, aeronautics,      human space flight and exploration, and education, that      serves as the foundation for the policy updates by this       (4) Sufficient investment and maximum utilization of the      ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and      industry partners is--       (A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the United      States space program; and       (B) imperative to continuing United States global      leadership in human space exploration, science, research,      technology development, and education opportunities that      contribute to development of the next generation of American      scientists, engineers, and leaders, and to creating the      opportunity for economic development of low-Earth orbit.       (5) NASA has made measurable progress in the development      and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration      systems with the near-term objectives of the initial      integrated test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in      2021, and continued missions with an annual cadence in cis-     lunar space and eventually to the surface of       (6) The Commercial Crew Program has made measurable      progress toward reestablishing the capability to launch      United States government astronauts from United States soil      into low-Earth orbit by the end of 2018.       (7) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual      Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the      potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could      accompany significant changes to core NASA programs.    TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT     301. OPERATION OF THE       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in low-     Earth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and      operate safely;       (2) the ISS is a unique testbed for future space      exploration systems development, including long-duration      space travel;       (3) the expansion of partnerships, scientific research, and      commercial applications of the ISS is essential to ensuring      the greatest return on investments made by the United States      and its international space partners in the development,      assembly, and operations of that unique facility;       (4) utilization of the ISS will sustain United States      leadership and progress in human space exploration by--       (A) facilitating the commercialization and economic      development of low-Earth orbit;       (B) serving as a testbed for technologies and a platform      for scientific research and development; and       (C) serving as an orbital facility enabling research upon--       (i) the health, well-being, and performance of humans in      space; and       (ii) the development of in-space systems enabling human      space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and       (5) the ISS provides a platform for fundamental,      microgravity, discovery-based space life and physical      sciences research that is critical for enabling space      exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways      for commercial space development that depend on advances in      basic research, and contributes to advancing science,      technology, engineering, and mathematics research.       (b) Objectives.--The primary objectives of the ISS program      shall be--       (1) to achieve the long term goal and objectives under      section 202 of the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18312);      and       (2) to pursue a research program that advances knowledge      and provides other benefits to the       (c) Continuation of the ISS.--Section 501 of the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of      2010 (42 U.S.18351) is amended to read as follows:     ``501. CONTINUATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE       ``(a) Policy of the United States.--It shall be the policy      of the United States, in consultation with its international      partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete      utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.       ``(b) NASA Action.--In furtherance of the policy set forth      in subsection (a), NASA shall--       ``(1) pursue international, commercial, and      intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply,      maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to      ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize United      States operations costs relating to the ISS;       ``(2) utilize, to the extent practicable, the ISS for the      development of capabilities and technologies needed for the      future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and       ``(3) utilize, if practical and cost effective, the ISS for      Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.''.     302. TRANSPORTATION TO       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that reliance on foreign      carriers for United States crew transfer is unacceptable, and      the Nation's human space flight program must acquire the      capability to launch United States government astronauts on      vehicles using United States rockets from United States soil      as soon as is safe, reliable, and affordable to do so.       (b) Sense of Congress on Commercial Crew Program and      Commercial Resupply Services Program.--It is the sense of      Congress that--       (1) once developed and certified to meet the      Administration's safety and reliability requirements, United      States commercially provided crew transportation systems can      serve as the primary means of transporting United States      government astronauts and international partner astronauts to      and from the ISS and serving as ISS crew rescue vehicles;       (2) previous budgetary assumptions used by the      Administration in its planning for the Commercial Crew      Program assumed significantly higher funding levels than were      authorized and appropriated by Congress;[[Page S1402]]       (3) credibility in the Administration's budgetary estimates      for the Commercial Crew Program can be enhanced by an      independently developed cost estimate;       (4) such credibility in budgetary estimates is an important      factor in understanding program risk;       (5) United States access to low-Earth orbit is paramount to      the continued success of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory;       (6) a stable and successful Commercial Resupply Services      Program and Commercial Crew Program are critical to ensuring      timely provisioning of the ISS and to reestablishing the      capability to launch United States government astronauts from      United States soil into orbit, ending reliance upon Russian      transport of United States government astronauts to the ISS      which has not been possible since the retirement of the Space      Shuttle program in 2011;       (7) NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial      Orbital Transportation Services Program and Commercial      Resupply Services Program that have allowed private sector      companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and      scientific experiments to the ISS since 2012;       (8) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has enabled      significant modernization and infrastructure improvements at      launch sites across the United States to support NASA's      Commercial Resupply Services Program and other civil and      commercial space flight missions; and       (9) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be      continued in a manner that leverages State and private      investments to achieve the goals of that program.       (c) Reaffirmation.--Congress reaffirms--       (1) its commitment to the use of a commercially developed,      private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew      missions as expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155;      119 2895), the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422;      122 4779), and the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18301 et      seq.); and       (2) the requirement under section 50111(b)(1)(A) of title      51, United States Code, that the Administration shall make      use of United States commercially provided ISS crew transfer      and crew rescue services to the maximum extent practicable.

FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of      2010 (124 2813), the National Academies of Sciences,      Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human      Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core      capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and      published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report      entitled, ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and      Approaches for a U.Program of Human Space Exploration''.       (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders      from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy      communities.       (3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human      Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational      rationales for human space flight together constitute a      compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit      of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of       (4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the      rationales include economic benefits, national security,      national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens,      scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared      destiny.       (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars      is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight      program.       (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that      NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission      planning and technology development as needed to achieve the      long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of       (7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and      advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early      planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on      the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve      short-term and long-term goals and objectives.[[Page S1406]]       (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph      (1), there are several independently developed reports or      concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or      concepts and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human      space exploration, including NASA's ``The Global Exploration      Roadmap'' of 2013, ``NASA's Journey to Mars-Pioneering Next      Steps in Space Exploration'' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion      Laboratory's ``Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to      Mars'' of 2015, and Explore Mars' ``The Humans to Mars Report      2016''.     432. HUMAN EXPLORATION       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and      advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s requires      early strategic planning and timely decisions to be made in      the near-term on the necessary courses of action for      commitments to achieve short-term and long-term goals and      objectives;       (2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a      need exists to advance a human exploration roadmap,      addressing exploration objectives in collaboration with      international, academic, and industry partners;       (3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a long-     term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and      implementation would influence future development and      implementation; and       (4) a human exploration roadmap should begin with low-Earth      orbit, then address in greater detail progress beyond low-     Earth orbit to cis-lunar space, and then address future      missions aimed at human arrival and activities near and then      on the surface of       (b) Human Exploration Roadmap.--       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall develop a human      exploration roadmap, including a critical decision plan, to      expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to the surface      of Mars and beyond, considering potential interim      destinations such as cis-lunar space and the moons of       (2) Scope.--The human exploration roadmap shall include--       (A) an integrated set of exploration, science, and other      goals and objectives of a United States human space      exploration program to achieve the long-term goal of human      missions near or on the surface of Mars in the 2030s;       (B) opportunities for international, academic, and industry      partnerships for exploration-related systems, services,      research, and technology if those opportunities provide cost-     savings, accelerate program schedules, or otherwise benefit      the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);       (C) sets and sequences of precursor missions in cis-lunar      space and other missions or activities necessary--       (i) to demonstrate the proficiency of the capabilities and      technologies identified under subparagraph (D); and       (ii) to meet the goals and objectives developed under      subparagraph (A), including anticipated timelines and      missions for the Space Launch System and Orion;       (D) an identification of the specific capabilities and      technologies, including the Space Launch System, Orion, a      deep space habitat, and other capabilities, that facilitate      the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);       (E) a description of how cis-lunar elements, objectives,      and activities advance the human exploration of Mars;       (F) an assessment of potential human health and other      risks, including radiation exposure;       (G) mitigation plans, whenever possible, to address the      risks identified in subparagraph (F);       (H) a description of those technologies already under      development across the Federal Government or by other      entities that facilitate the goals and objectives developed      under subparagraph (A);       (I) a specific process for the evolution of the      capabilities of the fully integrated Orion with the Space      Launch System and a description of how these systems      facilitate the goals and objectives developed under      subparagraph (A) and demonstrate the capabilities and      technologies described in subparagraph (D);       (J) a description of the capabilities and technologies that      need to be demonstrated or research data that could be gained      through the utilization of the ISS and the status of the      development of such capabilities and technologies;       (K) a framework for international cooperation in the      development of all capabilities and technologies identified      under this section, including an assessment of the risks      posed by relying on international partners for capabilities      and technologies on the critical path of development;       (L) a process for partnering with nongovernmental entities      using Space Act Agreements or other acquisition instruments      for future human space exploration; and       (M) include information on the phasing of planned      intermediate destinations, Mars mission risk areas and      potential risk mitigation approaches, technology requirements      and phasing of required technology development activities,      the management strategy to be followed, related ISS      activities, planned international collaborative activities,      potential commercial contributions, and other activities      relevant to the achievement of the goal established in this      section.       (3) Considerations.--In developing the human exploration      roadmap, the Administrator shall consider--       (A) using key exploration capabilities, namely the Space      Launch System and Orion;       (B) using existing commercially available technologies and      capabilities or those technologies and capabilities being      developed by industry for commercial purposes;       (C) establishing an organizational approach to ensure      collaboration and coordination among NASA's Mission      Directorates under section 821, when appropriate, including      to collect and return to Earth a sample from the Martian      surface;       (D) building upon the initial uncrewed mission, EM-1, and      first crewed mission, EM-2, of the Space Launch System and      Orion to establish a sustainable cadence of missions      extending human exploration missions into cis-lunar space,      including anticipated timelines and milestones;       (E) developing the robotic and precursor missions and      activities that will demonstrate, test, and develop key      technologies and capabilities essential for achieving human      missions to Mars, including long-duration human operations      beyond low-Earth orbit, space suits, solar electric      propulsion, deep space habitats, environmental control life      support systems, Mars lander and ascent vehicle, entry,      descent, landing, ascent, Mars surface systems, and in-situ      resource utilization;       (F) demonstrating and testing 1 or more habitat modules in      cis-lunar space to prepare for Mars missions;       (G) using public-private, firm fixed-price partnerships,      where practicable;       (H) collaborating with international, academic, and      industry partners, when appropriate;       (I) any risks to human health and sensitive onboard      technologies, including radiation exposure;       (J) any risks identified through research outcomes under      the NASA Human Research Program's Behavioral Health Element;      and       (K) the recommendations and ideas of several independently      developed reports or concepts that describe potential Mars      architectures or concepts and identify Mars as the long-term      goal for human space exploration, including the reports      described under section 431.       (4) Critical decision plan on human space exploration.--As      part of the human exploration roadmap, the Administrator      shall include a critical decision plan--       (A) identifying and defining key decisions guiding human      space exploration priorities and plans that need to be made      before June 30, 2020, including decisions that may guide      human space exploration capability development, precursor      missions, long-term missions, and activities;       (B) defining decisions needed to maximize efficiencies and      resources for reaching the near, intermediate, and long-term      goals and objectives of human space exploration; and       (C) identifying and defining timelines and milestones for a      sustainable cadence of missions beginning with EM-3 for the      Space Launch System and Orion to extend human exploration      from cis-lunar space to the surface of       (5) Reports.--       (A) Initial human exploration roadmap.--The Administrator      shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress--       (i) an initial human exploration roadmap, including a      critical decision plan, before December 1, 2017; and       (ii) an updated human exploration roadmap periodically as      the Administrator considers necessary but not less than      biennially.       (B) Contents.--Each human exploration roadmap under this      paragraph shall include a description of--       (i) the achievements and goals accomplished in the process      of developing such capabilities and technologies during the      2-year period prior to the submission of the human      exploration roadmap; and       (ii) the expected goals and achievements in the following      2- year period.       (C) Submission with budget.--Each human exploration roadmap      under this section shall be included in the budget for that      fiscal year transmitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of      title 31, United States     433. ADVANCED SPACE SUIT       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate      committees of Congress a detailed plan for achieving an      advanced space suit capability that aligns with the crew      needs for exploration enabled by the Space Launch System and      Orion, including an evaluation of the merit of delivering the      planned suit system for use on the     434. ASTEROID ROBOTIC REDIRECT       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) NASA initially estimated that the Asteroid Robotic      Redirect Mission would launch in December 2020 and cost no      more than $1,250,000,000, excluding launch and operations.       (2) On July 15, 2016, NASA conducted its Key Decision      Point-B review of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission or      approval for Phase B in mission formulation.       (3) During the Key Decision Point-B review, NASA estimated      that costs have grown to $1,400,000,000 excluding launch and      operations for a launch in December 2021 and the agency must      evaluate whether to accept the[[Page S1407]]     increase or reduce the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission's      scope to stay within the cost cap set by the       (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council--       (A) issued a finding that--       (i) high-performance solar electric propulsion will likely      be an important part of an architecture to send humans to      Mars; and       (ii) maneuvering a large test mass is not necessary to      provide a valid in-space test of a new solar electric      propulsion stage;       (B) determined that a solar electric propulsion mission      will contribute more directly to the goal of sending humans      to Mars if the mission is focused entirely on development and      validation of the solar electric propulsion stage; and       (C) determined that other possible motivations for      acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid science      and planetary defense, do not have value commensurate with      their probable cost.       (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is competing for      resources with other critical exploration development      programs, including the Space Launch System, Orion,      commercial crew, and a habitation module.       (6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that      NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment of      the Asteroid Robotic Redirect       (7) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that      NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program      needed to be descoped:       (A) Development of high power solar electric propulsion.       (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity environment in      deep space.       (8) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA Advisory      Council expressed its concern to NASA about the potential for      growing costs for the program and highlighted that choices      would need to be made about the program's content.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid      Robotic Redirect Mission have not been demonstrated to      Congress to be commensurate with the cost; and       (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost effective      and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate the      technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would      otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect            (c) Evaluation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after      the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--       (1) conduct an evaluation of--       (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic Redirect      Mission for demonstrating the technologies and capabilities      needed for a human mission to Mars that would otherwise be      demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission;       (B) the scientific and technical benefits of the      alternative approaches under subparagraph (A) to future human      space exploration compared to scientific and technical      benefits of the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission;       (C) the commercial benefits of the alternative approaches      identified in subparagraph (A), including the impact on the      development of domestic solar electric propulsion technology      to bolster United States competitiveness in the global      marketplace; and       (D) a comparison of the estimated costs of the alternative      approaches identified in subparagraph (A); and       (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a      report on the evaluation under paragraph (1), including any      recommendations.     435. MARS 2033       (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall contract with      an independent, non-governmental systems engineering and      technical assistance organization to study a Mars human space      flight mission to be launched in 2033.       (b) Contents.--The study shall include--       (1) a technical development, test, fielding, and operations      plan using the Space Launch System, Orion, and other systems      to successfully launch such a Mars human space flight mission      by 2033;       (2) an annual budget profile, including cost estimates, for      the technical development, test, fielding, and operations      plan to carry out a Mars human space flight mission by 2033;      and       (3) a comparison of the annual budget profile to the 5-year      budget profile contained in the President's budget request      for fiscal year 2017 under section 1105 of title 31, United      States       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the      appropriate committees of Congress a report on the study,      including findings and recommendations regarding the Mars      2033 human space flight mission described in subsection (a).       (d) Assessment.--Not later than 60 days after the date the      report is submitted under subsection (c), the Administrator      shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress an      assessment by the NASA Advisory Council of whether the      proposal for a Mars human space flight mission to be launched      in 2033 is in the strategic interests of the United States in      space exploration.                    Subtitle D--TREAT Astronauts Act     441. SHORT       This subtitle may be cited as the ``To Research, Evaluate,      Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act'' or the ``TREAT Astronauts      Act''.     442. FINDINGS; SENSE OF       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges      and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed      the lives of 24 NASA astronauts serving in the line of duty.       (2) As United States government astronauts participate in      long-duration and exploration space flight missions they may      experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment,      bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance      risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation.      Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can      result in acute and long-term health consequences that can      increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have      potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central      nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and      vision.       (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration      space flight missions, United States government astronaut      Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space      while his identical twin brother, former United States      government astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control      specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the      physical, behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction      of the human body to an extended period of time in space.       (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical      monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States      government astronauts during their active employment, given      the unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration      space exploration, the Administration has requested statutory      authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring,      diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government      astronauts for psychological and medical conditions      associated with human space flight.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown      and lead the world in space exploration and scientific      discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration      and exploration space flight in deep space and an eventual      mission to Mars;       (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become      increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many      diseases humans face on Earth;       (3) the Administration should provide the type of      monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection      (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique      to the training or exposure to the space flight environment      of United States government astronauts and should not require      any former United States Government astronauts to participate      in the Administration's monitoring;       (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not      replace a former United States government astronaut's private      health insurance;       (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis,      and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the      requirements for new space flight medical hardware, and      develop controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in      the astronaut corps; and       (6) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the      ISS--       (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States for      humans to explore deep space and Mars as the mission      generated new insight into how the human body adjusts to      weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of long-     duration space flight; and       (B) will help support the physical and mental well-being of      astronauts during longer space exploration missions in the      future.     443.

1477,topic-id,1455,"Madam President, it has been since January 20 when President Trump was inaugurated that we have been trying to get his Cabinet choices confirmed here in the Unfortunately, it has been slow-walked to the point now that tonight we are going to be voting on the President's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, Mr.Wilbur I am grateful to Mr.Ross for wanting to serve the country in this way. I think President Trump has chosen wisely as to the Commerce  One of the things President Trump said Mr.Ross will do is enter into the negotiation process on NAFTA, the North American Free-Trade In my part of the world, in Texas, NAFTA is viewed positively; it is not a dirty word.  Some people have suggested that trade somehow has a negative impact on our economy, but I believe the evidence is to the contrary. As a matter of fact, just between Mexico and the United States--5 million jobs depend on binational trade between Mexico and the United I know from time to time we have differences of views with I saw that Secretary Kelly and Secretary Tillerson were in Mexico City on Wednesday talking about some of those differences but reassuring our Mexican counterparts of our sincerity and good will in trying to work through those. But the fact is, we share a common border with What happens in Mexico has an impact on the economy and public safety in the United States and vice versa.  So I am actually grateful for the conversation I have had with the Secretary of Commerce nominee, Wilbur Ross and that he is interested in updating NAFTA, the North American Free-Trade Agreement, rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water. I think that is a positive approach and one that I certainly support.  We have a lot more Cabinet posts that remain vacant in the executive branch because our friends across the aisle have decided that somehow serves their political interests. But it does not serve the public's interests and it does not serve the country's interests to have a brandnew administration without the ability of the President to pick and choose the people he wants to help him govern the country. It creates more problems, and it also prevents us from getting on with the other important business of the Congress and working together with this President to try to move the country forward in so many important ways.  I am glad we will actually consider Congressman Zinke's nomination for the Department of Interior later this evening, but we are going to have to go through this arduous process, this procedural process of cloture and postcloture time-burning before we can actually vote on this qualified nominee. I have said before that by holding up these qualified nominees, they are not only preventing the executive branch from working for the benefit of the American people, but they are also keeping us from our other job. After we get out of the personnel business, we need to get about the business of legislating and producing results for the American people. So I hope that at some point and at some point soon, our Democratic friends will let us move on from the confirmation process and get down to work where we can make that progress.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  One of the areas in which I am very excited about our ability to effect change will be in considering the President's nominee to fill the seat left vacant by the tragic passing of Justice Antonin It has been a month since President Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to that position. As Americans--including Members of the Senate--are familiarizing themselves with his incredible record, I have been glad to see folks on both sides of the aisle speak so well of him, not just his sterling character and his sterling legal career but how he appears to be really the role model for the type of person you would want to see sitting on the Supreme Court of the United Those who know him and his work understand that he exemplifies the integrity, intellect, and accomplishment we would expect from someone on our highest  Some of our colleagues across the aisle--notably the minority leader--have complained that Judge Gorsuch has refused to prejudge certain issues he has been asked about that will likely come before him as a member of the Supreme Court of the United I think Judge Gorsuch has it right. It is common practice for Supreme Court nominees, reflecting the judicial ethics of not deciding cases before they are actually presented, to decline to answer those sorts of speculative questions. Justice Ginsburg, whom the minority leader clearly respects, made this point eloquently, and Supreme Court nominees have adhered to the norm ever since. If following the well-conceived practices developed by people like Justice Ginsburg of declining to answer questions about how they would decide a case if it came before the Supreme Court--certainly if that is the rule she would embrace, then that ought to be good enough for Judge Gorsuch as well.  I think it reflects the fact that our friends across the aisle who are looking for something to complain about with Judge Gorsuch simply can't find anything, and so they are creating this false choice of asking him to decide cases before he even assumes the bench on the Supreme Court, which clearly is unethical for any judge to do because judges are not politicians running on a platform; a judge's job is to decide the law according to the law and the How can you possibly know before the case is presented what the facts might be or how the issue might be presented to the court?  Every ethicist, every legal scholar who has had a chance to comment on such things understands that we can't ethically require judges to say how they would decide cases before they go on the court. If they did, I think they would be disqualified from serving because they would really be just a politician wearing a black robe but one who is unaccountable to the American people since they serve literally for life.[[Page S1431]]  Editorial boards across the country and even former Obama administration officials have recognized Judge Gorsuch as a man who would ``help restore confidence in the rule of law.'' Before he was even announced as the nominee, an editorial in the Denver Post, his hometown newspaper, encouraged President Trump to select him. They called Judge Gorsuch ``a brilliant legal mind and talented writer.'' That same paper, by the way, endorsed Hillary Clinton for But they agree that Neil Gorsuch is a tremendous nominee for the Supreme  Just last week, the Washington Post issued an article titled ``Simply stated, Gorsuch is steadfast and surprising.'' Well, that is a very concise way to put it, and it is actually a great summary. He is steadfast in his belief in originalism; that is, the text of the Constitution actually means what it says, not based on some desire to see some particular policy affected that has nothing to do with the literal text of the That is what judges do--they interpret a written Constitution, not an evolving Constitution or decide cases based on their public policy preferences.  It is clear that Judge Gorsuch is independent. He interprets the law as a judge should--with fairness and without bias.  To put it another way, Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of nominee you would hope to see from any administration, and it is gratifying to see him nominated to this important seat by President I am sure, because of the qualities I have described, that is why he was previously confirmed unanimously by the U.Senate to his current position on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth  Judge Gorsuch is a tremendous jurist and scholar. He will be appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March for questioning by members of the Judiciary Committee, and then there will be a vote. He has been confirmed by the Senate before unanimously, as I said, because he was then and is now a mainstream pick with an exceptional legal record. The more we learn about him, it seems the more we hear from folks along his journey from childhood, to law school, to his professional life, commending his intellect, integrity, and his strong sense of character. I believe he is simply the right man for the job. I look forward to considering him before the Judiciary Committee and to confirming him soon.  Madam President, I yield the floor.

1699,topic-id,1327,"Mr.President, tonight, President Trump will address a joint session of Congress for the very first time. This, of course, will be his first opportunity as President to talk about his agenda and his vision for the Nation with the American people, who will be listening. I look forward to hearing what he has to say.  He will, undoubtedly, talk about the promises he made during the campaign and how he is working to deliver on them for the American people. I know the cornerstone of that vision for America is that of reviving our economy and boosting job growth.  Fortunately, he has already taken a few steps--through Executive action--in that direction, for which I am grateful. He has also nominated top-notch financial and economic advisers to look at our archaic Tax Code and to review our trade agreements so as to get our country back on track. He has begun to trim the fat of our bureaucracy, and he continues to push for measures that keep the government from interfering unnecessarily in the lives of American families.  Congress has also played an important role. Earlier this month, we passed the first of several resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act--one, to roll back the erosion of Second Amendment rights and another to repeal a job-killing rule that targeted our energy providers. There were others as well.  These rules have one characteristic in common, which is that all of these rules that we are rolling back through congressional resolutions of disapproval were put in place under the Obama administration. They frequently represent overreach in executive authority or in, certainly, what is prudent when it comes to regulation. There is such a thing as prudent regulation and overregulation, and I think what we saw is regulatory overreach under the Obama administration.  We finally have a President in the White House who will sign these bills into law that we pass here. I am glad the President is delivering on his promise to protect American jobs and to grow our economy, and he is willing to work with Congress to do just that.  Another area in which Congress and the administration are working together is in repealing and replacing ObamaCare is, perhaps, President Obama's signature legacy. His healthcare law, by all accounts, is completely unsustainable and is, essentially, creating a real crisis for the people who happen to be on those exchanges.  Texas families cannot afford these high monthly premiums or the sky-high deductibles that so often go along with them. In fact, here is an interesting statistic. In Texas, if you have a gross income of $24,000 a year, you could well end up spending 30 percent of your gross income on healthcare costs. That certainly doesn't sound affordable, which was the promise of  I look forward to working with our colleagues to deliver on the promise we made to the American people to repeal ObamaCare and put in its place a healthcare law that actually works for people, not against them--one that provides them with more choices and fewer mandates; if they like their doctors, they can keep their doctors; if they like their plans, they can keep their plans; and, yes, they can even save money. All of this was promised under ObamaCare, but none of it has proven to be true.  We do know some of the basic principles of that replacement for ObamaCare--that of moving healthcare decisions, for example, away from Washington to where they belong--with patients, their families, and their doctors. Actually, I think this is sort of the healthcare counterpart of what we did with the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was the follow-on to No Child Left Behind in moving more of the decision-making out of Washington and back to the States--back to the people most intimately affected and the people most interested in the results.  We also believe in giving patients the right tools they can use, like health savings accounts, to make their healthcare more portable and more affordable; in breaking down barriers that restrict choice and prevent Americans from picking the insurance plans that are best for them and their families; and, finally, in empowering small businesses to provide employees with the same kind of affordable health coverage that meets their needs. Association health plans is, perhaps, one of the most commonly recognized means of doing that.  I am glad that we finally have a President in office who will work with us and not against us when it comes to repealing and replacing ObamaCare and in giving the American people more choices at a price they can afford when it comes to their health care.  For our economy to grow, we have to have a stable and safe country, though, where our people can flourish. That brings me to President Trump's latest promise to restore national security as the number one priority in our budgeting process. He has already nominated and we have confirmed two incredibly strong leaders to key posts in his national security That would be Defense Secretary Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary I am confident that these men will do a stand-up job. America is lucky to have them continuing to serve our Nation in these new positions, and I am grateful to them for their service. The safety of our communities and the safety of our country and world peace is our chief job.  As Ronald Reagan demonstrated, the best way to keep the world peaceful is for America to remain strong because when America retreats from the world stage, when America no longer leads or when we underfund our national security requirements, all it does is encourages the bullies and the tyrants and the thugs around the world to fill the gap. That is what we have seen time and time again, ranging from Vladimir Putin in Russia--the best message we can send to Vladimir Putin is not necessarily additional Russian sanctions, which I would vote in favor of, but to quit the reversing of our spending on national security priorities. That is something he understands--strength. That is something he will respect. He does not respect weakness. In fact, it is an enticement to him to dangerous activities, as we have seen not only in Crimea and Ukraine but also now in Syria and the Greater Middle  I have to say that the truth is, since the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the sequestration process that came along with that, we haven't made national security our 1 priority--the priority it should be. I hope, working together with our colleagues and the administration, we can fix that because there are a lot of things the Federal Government funds that are simply things that we would like to do but are not absolutely essential to our existence, our prosperity, and our welfare, such as national security.  I think President Trump has demonstrated that he understands what the priorities should be, and I know he will keep the goal of national security at the forefront. We ought to do everything we can, working together with this administration, to make that a success.  I look forward to hearing the President talk about some of his accomplishments in the 5 short weeks since he has been in office. You look at the stock market, for example, at historic[[Page S1463]]highs. I think there is a lot of anticipation, a growing confidence not only in our economy but that America is now back in a leadership role and that the whole world will end up benefiting--most importantly, the American people.  I am eager to learn about how Congress can continue to partner with our new President to make his administration a success, so that America can remain a success, and to make the rest of his campaign promises a reality.                            Order for Recess  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12 noon until 2:15 p.m. today.

He was a loving husband, father, and grandfather. He dedicated much of his life to public service.  No matter whether you were a good friend or you hardly knew Joe, he had a way of making everyone feel important and special.  In 1968, he started a 26-year career at the Fresno Economic Opportunities After 2 years of serving as the director of the Fresno County Head Start, Joe was promoted to serve as the executive director for Fresno During his tenure at the Fresno EOC, he established 35 new programs, with a budget starting at $1.8 million, growing it to $37 million.  With the help of over 670 employees in the Fresno EOC, he was able to implement so many important programs, such as the Women, Infants, and Children program, otherwise known as WIC; opened the first rural health clinic in Fresno County; and started Meals on Wheels programs for seniors.  But he didn't stop there. Joe was a doer. He created a sanctuary program for homeless youth, which was established and later named in his honor upon Joe's retirement. Under his leadership, the Fresno EOC became a model for similar programs around the Nation, one of the truly outstanding leaders in terms of community action agencies in the country. Joe made that happen.  In 1977, he became the first African American elected to the Fresno City He served two terms and was always an advocate for what was best for the entire city. He said: You know, you've got to feel it in your gut; and if it's there, you do it.  He was a civil rights leader in our San Joaquin Valley and throughout the State and the Nation, encouraging others to do the right thing.  My thoughts and prayers are with Joe's wife, Laura; their children, Michael and his wife, Sonya, Winston, and Terri; his brother, George; his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and numerous nieces and nephews.  My colleagues, I ask you to join me in paying tribute to the life and times of Joe He will be remembered in a selfless way in which he lived his life, always looking to help those in the community who needed help.  As Emerson once said: ``To have a friend is first to be a friend.''  Thank you, Joe, for being my friend and being the friend of our community. I join his family in honoring his life and love and service to our country, and he will be greatly missed.

16,topic-id,406,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to speak about the flood conditions in It is either feast or famine. We either had the last 6 years of some of the driest conditions we have experienced in over 1,000 or, in the last 2 months, record rain and snow in the mountains and, thus, floods that we are experiencing.  This last weekend I joined on an official tour of Merced County with Sheriff In Le Grand, this weekend we had 25 homes in my district that were evacuated.  I commend the collaboration between the Merced County officials, the California Office of Emergency Services, and FEMA for rightly declaring a state of emergency for the flooding that is happening and may continue with new storms coming.  My thoughts are with the people in Butte, and Sutter and Yuba The emergency spillway that could be compromised at Oroville Dam is something that we are all concerned about; 200,000 people, as we know, have been evacuated from their homes.  That is why I joined Congressman Garamendi and my colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump requesting, as the government has asked, a Major Disaster Declaration under the Stafford A Major Disaster Declaration will provide greater collaboration among local, State, and Federal governments, and will provide immediate resources where they are most needed.  Additionally, we must invest in California's infrastructure needs. Its water infrastructure needs to fix a broken water system. The President has proposed a significant massive infrastructure program, $1 trillion. That could be used not only in California, but throughout the entire country.  We need additional water storage in order to prevent devastating flood conditions as we are having now, and also to store that water so we can have it during the dry conditions. So two things go hand in hand.  There are another series of storms expected later this week, and we still have about 2 months left of our winter season. Therefore, we need all hands on deck. We are using every tool available to reduce the potential flood and damage and accidents that are there, but we must invest to fix this broken water system.  The President's proposal will allow us to provide additional surface storage supply to not only protect against flooding, but also to store that water so that when we have the dry periods in California, we can use that water for our crops and for the people who need it the most.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1132.txt,1774,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,14.0,February
571,topic-id,1398,"Mr.President, our Tax Code is a mess. No one voted for it, no one wants it, and no one likes it. I have said many times we should eliminate all of the special interest loopholes in the code and use that money to cut taxes for everyone, including American businesses. We want to encourage them to invest, grow, and create more jobs right here in  I know my colleagues are working on a tax bill, and I want to stress how much I support their efforts. I will, of course, withhold judgment on any proposal until I see the final text, but I also want to say today, I have reservations about one idea that is being considered. It is called a border adjustment tax. It sounds like something from Orwell's  Here is how it would work. We would cut taxes for corporations. To make up for the lost revenue, we would tax businesses whenever they bought something from another country. For instance, every time Ford bought an auto part from Canada, it would pay a 20-percent tax or every time your local grocery store bought bananas from Guatemala, it would pay a 20-percent tax. Whatever money businesses made from selling their products in other countries would be exempt. In other words, what all this would amount to is a 20-percent tax on imports. The proponents of this tax contend it would stop businesses from leaving our country because right now some are moving overseas to avoid paying our corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the modern industrial world. Under this proposal, it would not matter where you put your headquarters, you would be taxed according to what you bought, not where you put down your stake.  The hope is, this arrangement would mean more headquarters, more factories and the jobs that come with them staying right here in America, which of course is a desirable goal, no doubt, but I am not at all convinced this is the best way to do it. Consider this. It is estimated that this one change alone would produce something like $100 billion a year in additional tax revenue. That is a lot of money, and someone has to pay for it. I will tell you exactly who is going to pay: working Americans who have been struggling for decades. A tax on imports is a tax on things working folks buy every single day. I am not talking about caviar and champagne. I am talking about T-shirts, jeans, shoes, baby clothes, toys, and groceries.  I have heard from thousands of Arkansans who are already struggling just to get by. Why would we make the stuff they get at Walmart more expensive? Its defenders say the tax will not increase the cost of imports. What will happen, they say, is our exports will be cheaper because we no longer tax them so then more people overseas will buy our exports from us, which means the dollar itself will increase in value. That means imports will not be expensive because you will be able to buy them with a stronger dollar. So even with the tax added on, you will still come out right where you were before.  This logic reminds me of Orwell again: Some ideas are so stupid only an intellectual could believe them. This is a theory wrapped in speculation inside a guess. Nobody knows for sure what will happen. No one can know for sure because currency markets fluctuate daily based on millions of decisions and events. Just because an economist slaps an equation on a blackboard does not make it real so I am more than a little concerned these predictions will not pan out.  As the old joke goes, after all, economists have predicted nine of the last five recessions. But if that happens, it will not be economists and intellectuals and politicians in Washington and New York left holding the bag; working Americans will get stiffed again.  Finally, I want to say a word about jobs. One of the biggest reasons for fixing the Tax Code is that it would help create more jobs, but if we increase the cost of goods, people obviously can't buy as much, which will hurt retail sales and retail jobs too. Retail companies are the largest private sector employers in almost every Are we really going to impose a huge tax on the livelihood of so many Americans and say: Oh, don't worry. It will all work out in the end.  We have to take a hard look at this proposal right now. Therefore, while I support fundamental tax reform and commit to reserve judgment on any final bill until I read it, today I want to put on the record my serious concerns about a border adjustment tax. Many other Senators share those concerns. We most certainly will not keep our powder dry and see working American's railroaded with a precooked deal that raises their taxes and increases the price of the stuff they buy every single day.  It is February 15. By law, the President is required to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday of this month. That was over a week ago. Now, being a new administration, we expect him to be a few weeks late as has typically happened in recent times. The difference this year, though, is that President Trump still does not have a budget director. We are 4 weeks into his Presidency, and we are only just now getting around to confirming his nominee.  For those of you keeping score at home, that is the longest delay in recent history. Every one of the last six Presidents had their budget director confirmed by a week's time--as in 7 days. In other words, what we are seeing is a deliberate act of obstruction. Here is the real problem. We have serious work to do. It is that much more difficult for the President to do his job when all he has is a headless horseman bureaucracy.  Senate Democrats might consider this payback. They might consider it their chance to audition for the 2020 Presidential primary, but the American people are the ones paying the price for this obstruction.  I want to say again, this is not a game. This is not a protest. This is our job. This is what the American people sent us to do. It is time we got down to business. In that spirit, I want to say a few words in support of the President's[[Page S1198]]nominee for the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick I don't have to cite or recite Mick's biography for many of you.  He has been representing the good people of South Carolina's Fifth District in the House of Representatives for more than 6 years now. Before that, he led an impressive career as what he called a serial entrepreneur, starting four different businesses. I hear some of them may have even succeeded.  He has worked in fields as varied as law, real estate, homebuilding, and restaurants. He is highly educated and very accomplished. I would like to point out, he is a friend of mine, a trusted confidant, someone whose advice and counsel I have often sought.  I can say with confidence, he will serve President Trump and the American people with dedication and distinction. I believe Mick will bring a needed voice to the President's Cabinet, a voice for fiscal responsibility after so many years of irresponsible sky-is-the-limit spending.  All that experience in the real economy gives him something more than a lengthy resume. He knows from personal experience what it takes to create jobs and create opportunities out of almost nothing. He knows the self-discipline it takes, the hard work, the perseverance. He knows what Americans have to go through every day just to earn an honest dollar. That is why he has been so protective of every taxpayer dollar ever put in his care. That is the kind of man we need as our next OMB  It is only when Washington appreciates what goes into making all of those taxpayer dollars that it will show the taxpayers the respect they deserve.

953,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, I recently read a story in the Wall Street Journal that I thought was so alarming it demanded action. Here is the headline: ``Marathon Pharmaceuticals to Charge $89,000 for Muscular Dystrophy Drug After 70-Fold Increase.''  Yes, that is $89,000 a year, and, yes, that is a 70-fold increase--70-fold, as in 7,000 percent.  For those of you who have not read the article, here is the story. There is a rare disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It affects about 12,000 young men in the United Most of them, unfortunately, end up dying in their twenties and thirties because of it.  We don't have a cure yet for Until recently, there was not even a treatment with FDA approval. So, for many years, patients and parents have been importing a drug called deflazacort, a steroid, from other countries. Even though it is not a cure, it at least helps treat symptoms and has been a welcome relief to many families.  Well, technically it is illegal to import a drug that doesn't have FDA approval. But there is a catch. The FDA does not quite enforce the ban against all unapproved drugs. In fact, it has issued regulatory guidance saying that you can get an exemption and buy an unapproved drug from overseas if you meet five conditions. First, you have to have a serious illness for which there is no other treatment available. Second, you can't sell the drug. Third, you can't pose an unreasonable risk to your health. Fourth, it has to be for you and you alone. Fifth, you can't buy more than a 3-month supply.  All of that sounds fair enough. But if someone comes along and gets FDA approval for their version of the exact same drug, the exact same chemical composition of the drug that is being imported, then you cannot buy it overseas anymore. That is exactly what happened here.  This was not a new drug. This was not a medical breakthrough. This was not a scientific advance. This was, plain and simple, an arbitrage opportunity. Other people had already gone to the trouble of making a drug that worked, but if you paid the expenses of getting FDA approval, you would essentially buy for yourself monopoly pricing power. That is what other companies missed, and now, to cover the costs of going through that approval process, Marathon is increasing the price from roughly $1,500 a year to $89,000 a year.  I don't think it is an overstatement to say that this turn of events is nothing short of outrageous. It defeats the very purposes of our FDA laws. The reason we offer people the chance to create a monopoly is to encourage innovation and medical breakthroughs, to generate new drugs that are going to solve diseases or illnesses.  What we are saying is, if you go to the pain and expense of developing a new treatment, we will give you the sole rights to sell it for a number of years so you can recover your costs, and, therefore, we will encourage more medical breakthroughs to alleviate the pain and suffering of the American people. In other words, monopoly rights are not merit badges. They are not a reward for business smarts. They are supposed to serve the interests of patients. They are supposed to expand access to treatment. But in this case, what we see in our system is, in fact, restricting access and driving up the price for that coverage.  I understand that many people with Duchenne are happy that Marathon has done this because now that the drug has FDA approval, insurance companies will likely cover it--unlike before when people had to pay out of pocket, meaning that poor kids didn't get access to deflazacort, whereas upper middle-class and rich kids typically did.  I also know that Marathon has promised to increase spending on research on a new drug and to help people of limited means afford that treatment. That, too, is all to the good.  I am not casting aspersions on anyone's motives here, but let's be real. Someone has to pay the full price of this drug at $89,000 a year. We have a drug that used to be available for $1,500 a year, and now it is $89,000 a year. Whatever happened, that is a systemwide failure. We as a Congress have to address it.  There is simply no getting around the fact that this story should never have been written in the first place because it should have never happened in the first place. We should be channeling peoples' ambition and entrepreneurial spirit into finding cures, not finding new and clever ways to make a profit. That is what our food and drug laws are designed to do. That is what they have clearly failed to do in this instance.  I just want to say that I am not going to let this story disappear. I am going to work with my colleagues to find a legislative solution to this mess and promote affordable, high-quality healthcare for all, for all families whose young children suffer from Duchenne and for every other orphan disease that has drugs that can be used for treatment and right now are being blocked from the market or for which we are paying way too much money as a society.

Agriculture is our largest industry, adding about $16 billion to our economy every year. But even those members--big as they are--can't give you a full appreciation of just how important the land is to our people. Sure, they make a living off it, but farming isn't just an ``industry'' to us--it is not just another statistical category like ``nondurable goods manufacturing.'' It is a way of life. The people of Arkansas cultivate the land. They nurture it. They teach their children how to care for it. These are people who get up at 5 a.m. to milk the cows. They have had these farms in their families for generations. They pass on the land--and the values they have learned along with it. They believe in the EPA's mission of preserving a healthy environment just as much as anyone.  Yes, they are stewards of the earth, these men and women, yet the EPA too often treats them as criminals. In the last 8 years alone, the EPA has been treating their property rights more like a form of parole. It has passed sweeping regulations that presume to tell farmers when they can plant and how often they can run a tractor. It has declared something as tiny as a mud puddle on a family farm as a ``navigable water''--thus under the EPA's jurisdiction it has put on a show of soliciting ``feedback'' from the people who have to live under its rules, while cavalierly dismissing most of their concerns, and all the while pursuing an activist agenda, whether through the Clean Power Plan or the waters of the United States rule, it has failed to fulfill its core mission: keeping our people safe. Just remember, the EPA helped bring criminal charges and a $15,000 fine against a North Carolina farm owner who accidentally spilled cow dung into a river; yet when it caused the wastewater spill into the Animas River, it stalled and withheld important information from investigators. If a company had acted like the EPA, it would likely have faced criminal charges--brought about by the  It is this state of affairs that our next EPA Administrator will inherit, and I want to take this opportunity to say President's Trump nominee, Scott Pruitt, has my support.

I believe he understands that Arkansas farmers and the American people know the needs of their land far better than Washington bureaucrats do. When I met with him a few weeks ago, we discussed the impact EPA regulations are having on Arkansas farms, businesses, and energy companies.

286,topic-id,748,"Mr.Speaker, as we are sitting here in this Chamber, right now off the coast of Groton, Connecticut, 30 miles from the Groton Navy Sub Base, which is the oldest submarine base in America, there is a Russian spy ship, the Viktor Leonov, that is loitering--as was reported this morning from the Navy and news sources--off the coast, again, within the bare minimum of international waters.  I can attest to the fact that--having just flown down from Connecticut a few days ago--anyone who would loiter off the coast of Connecticut is not doing it because of the great climate and weather. It is freezing weather out there. They are doing it, obviously, with aggressive intent, to say the least.  Mr.Speaker, this is part of a pattern that is going on right now not just off the East Coast of the U.S., but also overseas. The USS Porter, which is a Navy missile ship, was buzzed by military aircraft from Russia on February 10. They came within 200 yards of the ship. Again, because we have such incredibly competent and professional leadership that captain those vessels, an incident was avoided.  However, the danger of jet aircraft moving within 200 yards of a U.naval ship obviously is just common sense to anyone how high risk that is in terms of creating an incident that could have huge ramifications.  In addition to that, the news reported again just the last couple of days or so that the Russian military is now deploying intermediate medium-range nuclear warheads in different places throughout Western Russia, near Eastern Again, this is clearly in violation of treaties that go back decades.  As General Breedlove, who was the commander of NATO and the European Command who just stepped down, said that this new effort really just cannot go unanswered. It completely destabilizes the balance of power in that theater of the world.  Again, the folks in Connecticut woke up this morning with that news about the spy ship off the coast. As you can imagine, it has created a lot of consternation and questions.  Once again, I would reiterate that I have total confidence in our Navy leadership both at the Groton Navy base and here in Washington that they will react to this with total vigilance and professional competence to make sure that, again, our security is protected.  But I think it is time now for all of us in Washington, D.C., to understand that Vladimir Putin, during the 5 years that he has been in power, again, has taken a posture that is completely destabilizing any sort of global system of peace and security.  This new administration, which clearly has an infatuation with Putin--and this goes back during the campaign with President Trump talking on the campaign trail about his high regard for Putin's leadership--needs to basically move on and recognize that this is an emerging threat and that we have to take all necessary steps to respond to it both in the short-term and, obviously, as we take up defense policy and defense budgets, which is that the resurgence of the Russian Navy is a game-changer in terms of the demands on our fleet.  That is something that, again, on the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, which I am the ranking member, we are working hard in terms of implementing the Obama administration's boost to Navy shipbuilding and increasing the fleet size.  Again, we need to really, as I said, just disavow ourselves of any naive assumptions that somehow the Putin government is somehow something that we can trust, and shows any regard for international norms or international law.  Again, to the folks back home, I want you to know that we are monitoring this situation with our Navy team down here in Washington and I have total confidence that we are on top of this situation.  It is a reminder that the Russian Government and the investment that they have put into their Navy fleet is not a friendly gesture in terms of creating a system of global peace and security; and this administration needs to wake up and recognize that and move on to a bipartisan effort to respond to this threat.  They can do that by, again, disclosing all the background regarding General Flynn's interaction with the Russian Government because it is part and parcel of all those incidents which I listed in terms of aggressive actions that are happening in real time as we are here in Washington, D.C., today.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1189.txt,1836,OPEN BOOK ON EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT,2017.0,15.0,February

233,topic-id,653,"Mr.President, today I wish to urge support for H.40. The Second Amendment to our U.Constitution reads, ``A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' The fact that our Nation's Founding Father's penned this constitutional right to follow another central freedom--the constitutional right to free speech--speaks to the importance of this basic right.  H.40, the resolution currently under consideration, would protect Social Security beneficiaries from having their constitutional rights arbitrarily revoked by the Social Security As a cosponsor of the Senate companion resolution introduced by Senator Grassley, I support this critically important effort. The resolution would halt a rule issued by the Social Security Administration in the waning days of the outgoing Obama administration.  The previous administration, I might add, continuously sought to take away the Second Amendment rights of Americans through Executive orders and rulemaking. This is yet another example of an unjust leftover of that effort that needs to be corrected. In December 2016, under the direction of the Executive branch, the Social Security Administration issued a final rule to gather and submit information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, on individuals who are determined to be what NICS refers to as ``mentally deficient.'' In this case, a person can be reported to NICS simply for using a representative payee in managing their benefits.  It is not uncommon for the Social Security Administration to appoint someone to act as representative payee for a beneficiary who may need assistance to manage their benefits. The use of a representative payee is not indicative of mental deficiency. In fact, over 8 million beneficiaries need help managing their benefits, according to the Social Security Statute requires that, for an individual to be deemed ``mentally deficient,'' a court, board, or other lawful authority must find that the person is a danger to themselves or others or is unable to contract or manage their own affairs.  Under the rule that went into effect last week, SSA will be required to report individuals who have been appointed a representative payee to The Social Security Administration is not a court of law, and SSA officers are not a ``lawful authority.'' Equally alarming is the lack of an established appeals process to enable the removal of names from the system once entered. The Administration's lack of regard for due process is unacceptable.  We must reject the Obama administration's improper assumption that individuals are a danger to themselves or society because they participate in SSA's representative payee system. A January 2016 White House fact sheet estimated that SSA's rule would add 75,000 beneficiaries to the NICS list each year. The number of law-abiding individuals who will be added to the NICS list will likely be much higher. Thousands, if not millions, of Americans stand to lose their Second Amendment rights.  Over 91,000 comments were submitted to the Social Security Administration following the publication of the proposed NICS rule. I, along with several of my colleagues, wrote the Social Security Administration on four occasions to express our concerns about the proposed rule. Our concerns, and the concerns of 91,000 Americans, were clearly not factored into the rulemaking process.  Old age does not make someone a threat to society, and having a representative payee is not grounds to revoke constitutional rights. Millions of seniors are at risk of having their Second Amendment rights arbitrarily revoked on behalf of an Executive that is no longer in office. This is a brazen attack on our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Please join me in stopping this outrageous rule that was finalized in the waning weeks of a lameduck administration.

402,topic-id,545,"Mr.Speaker, sweetheart deals?  Since when is it a sweetheart deal to have a modicum of retirement for working poor and middle class people?  That is a sweetheart deal?  All I hear from the other side of the aisle is people talking about government overreach, executive orders, and unnamed bureaucrats. So it is surprising that today the Republican majority is creating a manmade roadblock toward helping working Americans save their own money for their own retirement.  We have all heard about the olden days when, if you worked for a company for life, you could retire with a guaranteed pension. Now, with the exception of union workers, the days of a guaranteed pension plan for most private sector workers are a thing of the past. Captains of industry don't offer them anymore. They line their own pockets instead.  Some employers have tried to fill that retirement income gap by offering 401(k) retirement savings plans. Not a bad thing, but it was not the answer that everyone thought it was going to be, the panacea that everyone made it out to be.  But for far too many companies, they don't offer any retirement package to their employees at all. Today, half of all Americans going to work are not offered a retirement plan from their employer, meaning these workers are not accumulating any nest egg outside of Social Security for their retirement years.  To address this growing retirement savings crisis, the Obama administration made it easier for States and large municipalities to sponsor their own 401(k)-style retirement plan for their residents who work in the private sector, but are not offered any retirement plan from their private sector job. They are not offered by their employer that 401(k) plan. They have nothing, no opportunity.  These rules do not require employees to participate, so the captains of industry who don't offer their employees a retirement plan, under the Obama administration rules, would not even have to participate. These rules do not require any employer contributions.  What these rules simply do is create a pathway for States and large cities, if they choose, to enroll private sector workers into a retirement savings vehicle so they can start saving early to enjoy the benefits of a more financially secure retirement. And what is wrong with that?  It is a universal fact that the most successful way to get people to save for their retirement is to enroll them in a retirement plan through their workplace and have a percentage of their pay taken out automatically and invested for the long-term future and for their benefit.  So these Obama administration rules were actually adopting best practices to help workers who had been offered no opportunity to save for their retirement, to start to build their own nest egg with their own money for their own future, potentially even investing in a private 401(k) plan down the road.  The cruel irony is, if these two bills pass, congressional Republicans will have prohibited States and local governments from trying to help those workers who have been forgotten about by some in the Federal Government and ignored by the private sector marketplace.

It is important because we are seeing a rise, quite frankly, of anti-Semitism not only around the world, but right here in the United It takes different forms in different places, but, in[[Page H1237]]the end, has the same result of targeting and hurting one of the historically most vulnerable groups in our world: the Jewish people.  One of the things that has been the most concerning to me is the minimizing of the suffering of the Jewish people during the Frankly, it is really outright disturbing--I don't know if that does it justice--that the White House of the United States of America, the home of our President, our present administration, representing the same country that defeated Nazi Germany, the same country that bore the Greatest Generation, the same country that led the fight against anti-Semitism worldwide, while recognizing from time to time it had to douse it here in the United States, our country, this same White House that I referred to deliberately refused to mention that the Holocaust was designed to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the Not a single mention of the Final The Final Solution was to obliterate, eliminate the Jewish people off the face of the  Yes, many people died in the Holocaust, as the gentlewoman made reference to so eloquently--disturbingly, but eloquently. Of the tens of millions of people who died, we know of them historically, but no race or religion was designated for elimination like the Jewish people were. The Final Solution was about ridding the Jewish people from the face of the It is that simple. It is imperative that this moment does not pass without some clarity.  What is clear is that the White House purposely removed the reference. They are proud of it. They doubled down. They tripled down. They removed the reference to the Jewish people in its statement on International Holocaust Remembrance  Why does this matter, you may ask? Well, first and foremost, it feeds the extremists. We know they exist. Let's face it, extremists have welcomed this White House statement. They love it, they glorify it, not just theoretically, but literally. Literally, White supremacists have welcomed the White House decision to leave any mention of the Jewish people out of the Holocaust remembrance.  Secondly, it matters because a lot of people in the world today either don't know that the Holocaust happened or don't believe that the Holocaust happened--not just theoretically, but literally don't believe that the Holocaust took place.  Literally, a 2014 global survey of anti-Semitic attitudes found that 35 percent of people around the world have never heard about the Maybe you can understand that. But an additional 32 percent, more importantly, believe it is a myth or greatly exaggerated.  Thirdly, it matters because there are many Holocaust survivors--I know them and their descendents--in the United States and throughout the world.  The actions behind the statement were just downright cruel and inhumane to them, not just theoretically, but literally cruel and inhumane.  Literally, groups that are dedicated to this issue are deeply, deeply disturbed. The Anne Frank Center and others have raised their voices.  This is not just coming from I don't want to mislead here at all. There are a range of Republican leaders--and there are four of them--and Republican groups that have expressed their anger at the White House position on the Holocaust, but one entity. We will come back to this House in a moment.  The White House hasn't seemed to have heard their outcry, but the gentlewoman from Ohio and I, the Democratic Caucus, we have heard.  What has taken place is wrong; simply wrong. You would think that the President would correct the situation. In fact, today, he had the opportunity to condemn anti-Semitism at his press conference with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and he didn't do it. In fact, when he was asked on this very subject of the failure to mention the Jewish people of the Holocaust, he used the opportunity not to clarify his position, but to make reference to how great his election victory was.  In watching that press conference, as disturbed as I was about the answer from our President, I was more than a bit disappointed, quite frankly, by Prime Minister Netanyahu's failure to challenge the President on that. I wish Prime Minister Netanyahu would have asked President Trump to change his statement; not to whitewash what was done, but to change his statement on the I still hope that the Prime Minister does that in the time that he is here.  So this Special Order tonight will help us set the record straight, not just on behalf of the millions of Jewish Americans across this country, but to send a clear message to all those who engage in this type of behavior.  I ask this question: Where are our Republican colleagues on this issue?  Do you hear that?  We have given them opportunity after opportunity to speak out against what the White House has done, but our Republican colleagues refuse to criticize the White House for the omission of the Jewish people in the Holocaust resolution.

The SCRUB Act would establish a $30 million commission of unelected--and I emphasize that, unelected--bureaucrats to duplicate work that agencies are already supposed to be doing.

That provision would require that, when an agency makes a new rule, it must offset the cost of that new rule for the repeal of an existing rule. This applies even if the new rule is in response to an imminent health or safety threat.  Agency compliance with this CutGo provision would also be subject to judicial review, which prolongs the process even more. This would inevitably result in lengthy delays, as both industry and nonprofit groups routinely file challenges to agency decisions.  President Obama has already issued two executive orders to eliminate unnecessary regulations. On January 18, 2011, he issued Executive Order 13563, requiring each agency to implement plans for reviewing existing rules. That executive order requires each agency to: ``periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed.''  In addition, President Obama issued Executive Order 13610 on May 10, 2012, requiring agencies to report twice a year to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on the status of their review efforts. In November 2014, a report prepared for the Administrative Conference of the United States highlighted the impact of these mandated reviews, concluding: ``Implementing President Obama's executive orders on retrospective review of regulations, agencies identified tens of billions of dollars of cost savings and tens of millions of hours of reduced paperwork and reporting requirements through modifications of existing regulations.''  Congress has the authority and certainly the responsibility to conduct oversight to review existing agency rules and to recommend or mandate reforms, yet this bill would create a new commission, a new commission that would cost taxpayers $30 million to do what agencies and Congress are already supposed to be doing.  In addition, the commission's report to Congress on the rules it recommends repealing would be subject to an up-or-down vote by the Congress would not be allowed to vote on each regulation individually, and this would usurp the authority of  One of the most troubling aspects of this bill is that it would entrust this unelected commission with extraordinary and virtually unlimited authority to subpoena witnesses or documents. Section 101(c) of the bill states: ``The commission may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence relating to the duties of the commission. The attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence may be required from any place within the United States at any designated place of hearing within the United States.''  Most agency inspectors general do not have such broad authority to compel witness testimony. Yet this unelected commission would have this authority. This means that it could compel an individual to testify on any subject. For example, a schoolteacher could be compelled to testify about education rules or a senior citizen could be compelled to testify about Medicare or Social Security rules. This extraordinary subpoena power is especially troubling because the commission's jurisdiction is limitless.  There is no restriction on what regulations the commission can review. Three prominent law professors with the Center for Progressive Reform sent a letter opposing an identical bill in the last The letter said this proposal would: ``create a convoluted,[[Page H1372]]complex, and potentially very expensive new bureaucracy to review existing agency rules and make recommendations for the repeal or weakening of those rules with little meaningful oversight, transparency, or public accountability to ensure that these recommendations do not subvert the public interest.''  In addition, Citizens for Sensible Safeguards, a coalition of more than 150 consumer, labor, and good-government groups, also oppose the bill.  This bill could have dangerous consequences for the health and safety of the American public; therefore, I strongly urge every Member to oppose it.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

This amendment would add another criterion to identify which rules the commission would recommend for repeal, specifically, whether an agency has complied with the requirements of title 5 U.S.C., section 801(a)(1)(A).  That section requires agencies, prior to promulgating a rule, to submit to each House of Congress and the Comptroller General a report containing a copy of the rule; a concise general statement relating to the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and the proposed effective date of the rule.  So this amendment would require this unelected commission to report to Congress on what information Congress has or has not received. This just underscores the point that Congress should do its own job rather than passing this bill to set up a commission to do our job for us.  Like the other criteria in the bill, Representative McSally's amendment does nothing to address the SCRUB Act's focus on the costs of the rules. The amendment fails to make sense of the CutGo provision, which would result in the repeal of rules with little regard for how these rules have benefited and protected the American public.  The amendment fails to address the fact that agencies are already doing a retrospective review of regulations.

On the good news side, we are here today to confirm Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the While he should have been passed through the Senate weeks ago, we are here now. We are here today. We are going to get it done in a couple of hours. That is good news.  As they say about Montana, we are a unique blend of Merle Haggard and John Denver, and mastering that melody is always a challenge. When you do, it results in a commonsense approach to environmental stewardship, and I can tell you Scott Pruitt is the guy to do it.  I literally left my office to come here and make these remarks, and guess who I was meeting with in my office. It was Scott  You know what we talked about?  He came into my office. When you come into my office, you can see Montana all over the walls. You are going to see me with a fly rod in my hand. You are going to see pictures of trout that we have caught and released back into the streams and rivers of our We talked about fly fishing in Yellowstone He loves to fly-fish.  In fact, he asked to me: Do you know where Cooke City, MT, is?  I said: Scott, Cooke City, MT? Let me show you. I have a map of the Beartooth in my office with pins in all the lakes that I have blown to. In fact, I spent 65 miles in the Beartooth Wilderness in August on horseback and on foot, above 10,000 feet, with an elk hair caddis and my fly rod, chasing golden trout and cutthroat trout. We spent a lot of time talking about that. We talked about elk hunting and deer hunting in  Scott Pruitt understands the important role that States play, especially in a State like I am confident he is going to restore this balanced focus, this Merle Haggard and John Denver balance that Montanans are pleading for. He will bring that back to the EPA, rather than this heavy-handed Gina McCarthy out-of-touch Federal approach.  Let me tell you a couple of stories of what is going on in Montana and why Scott Pruitt is exactly the right guy for the job. Today in the small town of Colstrip, MT, they face a real struggle to survive. Colstrip is a generating station and neighboring mine and the lifeblood of this small town.  Over the years, the Colstrip plant has continued to develop. They have adopted new technologies, and they made remarkable reductions in emissions and pollution. Yet it has been met with an onslaught of new environmental regulations that are having drastic compliance costs on our  Let me share some of those. Under this EPA power plan that was launched by Gina McCarthy, Montana needs to cut its emissions by 47 percent--the largest reduction in the Nation, leading almost inevitably to the entire shutdown of  In fact, according to a study conducted by the University of Montana, they said this plan will cost our State 7,000 jobs, $500 million in lost revenues, and $1.5 billion in gross sales for our And Montana moves from being an energy exporter to being an energy importer. That is outrageous, and the people of Montana know it.  For what? For what the Obama administration had projected to have a 0.02-degree impact on global temperature in the next 100 years--negligible. In fact, I confronted Gina McCarthy on that in a hearing, and she did not refute my data.  Similarly, the waters of the United States serves yet another example of the detrimental effects of Gina McCarthy's and President Obama's EPA, which has harmed Montana's farmers and ranchers. As I mentioned, one of my favorite things to do is get into the fresh air of Montana, the clean waters of Montana, up in wilderness country with my fly rod in my hand. We all want clean water. We all want clean air. I have yet to meet a single Montanan who says I don't want clean air; I don't want clean water.  The WOTUS rule was a clear effort by the Obama administration to gain control over Montana's livelihoods. It was a private property taking, seeking to regulate virtually every ditch and pond that could be occasionally wet across the State of  While, thankfully, this incredible overreach by the EPA and the Obama administration has been stopped by the courts, I am looking forward to working with Scott Pruitt to defend Montana farmers and ranchers and to defend Montana property owners from this unnecessary and harmful rule.  Scott Pruitt understands the important role our States play and not to levy unnecessary and overreaching Federal regulations--regulations that could decimate a State's economy. That is unacceptable.  I will tell what you else I talked to Scott Pruitt about; that is, the importance of cleaning up our Superfund sites. This is a critical responsibility of the We need to unleash American innovation, American cooperation--not cut off affordable energy sources at its heels.  Regarding Superfund cleanup, as Scott and I concluded our meeting, we talked about the Berkeley Pit in He has committed to getting that environmental disaster cleaned up. He assured me he will address these issues head-on.  The largest Superfund site in the United States is right there in Butte, We had snow geese that came across our State migrating. They landed in the toxic waters in the Berkeley Pit, and thousands of snow geese died just by landing in the water. Scott is committed to getting that fixed. It has been on the list for over 20 years. It is time to fix it, and Scott is committed, saying: Let's get this done.  That is why he is going to be a great Administrator, to protect the environment in  That is the good news. We are going to move Scott Pruitt through today, and I am looking forward to casting a ``yes'' vote for our next Administrator of the                        Nomination of Ryan Zinke  Let me share the bad news. Just this morning, Leader McConnell came here to move Congressman Zinke's nomination to be the next Secretary of Interior and debate that on the floor. Let's have unanimous consent; let's get that done.  Guess what. The Democrats objected. Why?  Ryan Zinke and I went to Boise State in 1979. He will be the first Cabinet appointee in the history of the State of Montana going back to statehood of 1889, and the Democrats are blocking us from getting that done today for no good reason.  He passed with a bipartisan vote of 16 to 6 in the Energy and Natural Resources He is going to be an outstanding addition to President Trump's I don't understand why it is being blocked.  We can get that done this afternoon--done. Let's get it done now. Instead, Ryan Zinke is being stopped from assuming his position as Secretary of the Guess what. We have a long list of things to do in  I am the chairman of the National Park We have a backlog of maintenance. We have to get Zinke in place now to start strengthening our national parks. He is going to be a great addition.  I am pleading with my colleagues. I am asking why. Give me a good reason why you are objecting to moving Congressman Zinke's nomination forward now? Why are you holding up this historic vote for Montana?  This will be the longest a President has waited for his team to be in place since George It is ridiculous. We need a Secretary of the Interior who will be a westerner, one who understands that Montana is that balance between Merle Haggard and John Denver; a Secretary who understands that, in Montana, our largest neighbor is the Federal Government; and a Secretary who understands how important our national parks are for us and for the 6 million folks who visit them every year. Ryan Zinke is a great guy for that job, but we can't even have a vote. So we wait.  We wait on the Democrats' political games to unfold. We wait on Democrats' political posturing.

I already fought a war over oil, and I would rather run my car on American-grown corn and soybeans than oil from the Middle During Operation Iraqi Freedom, 50 percent of all casualties occurred during convoy operations, and 80 percent of all convoy operations were conducted to transport diesel fuel. I think it is high time we invest more energy and more money and more support into development of biofuels like ethanol.  In addition to risking lives, we are wasting resources. Annually, we spend approximately $67.5 billion protecting global oil supplies. At home, Americans are using more gas than ever before. Yet OPEC has made it clear they are controlling the price we pay at the pump.  For example, in November of 2016, OPEC decided to cut its oil production to increase prices, and it caused a 10-percent increase in prices that very day. By December 12, prices had reached an 18-month high. We should not be risking lives and wasting money when we can use energy grown right here at home in States like mine. When we are producing more oil at home than ever before, that doesn't mean we can gut policies that are helping our Nation become energy independent. We need an EPA Administrator who will work with Congress to help us find ways to cut, not increase, our use of oil.  Scott Pruitt called the RFS unworkable. He clearly doesn't know that the renewable fuel standard is delivering triple bottom-line benefits. It is good for our security, it is good for our economy, and it is good for our climate. In my State of Illinois alone, the RFS employs more than 4,000 people and generates more than $5 billion in economic impact. Nationwide it is supporting 86,000 direct jobs. Those are good jobs with good wages. Those are people who are going home and paying their mortgages, sending their kids to school, and saving money toward retirement. It has helped to generate $8.7 billion in tax revenues that go to schools, roads, and first responders.  Mr.Pruitt's failure to support the RFS is not the only reason I oppose his nomination.  During his confirmation hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee, which I sit on, Mr.Pruitt gave vague, hollow, and evasive answers. It was clear that he either doesn't support or understand the mission of the very Agency he would like to lead.  Mr.Pruitt, the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency is to protect the basic ingredients that people need for a good life. It is to protect our air and our water. These issues, public health issues, are what he has spent his career in helping Big Oil to dismantle.  Take the issue of lead poisoning. One of the responsibilities of the EPA is to enforce our lead contamination laws that keep lead out of our air and water. When questioned at his confirmation hearing, I was shocked that Mr.Pruitt was unaware that there was no safe level of lead for children.  As a mom, this terrifies me. I remember sitting in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee when we had hearings on the Flint water crisis. I am a mom of a 2-year-old, and at the time my baby was just 1 year old. I remember being pregnant and having my daughter. I looked out into that audience, and I saw a mom holding a baby bottle that looked exactly like one my daughter drank out of--a little bottle with a pink top on it. The water in her baby bottle that she had to make her formula with was brown. It was brown. I thought about what it would have been like for me to have been drinking that water while I was pregnant and to have fed that water to my child and to have had the choice of: Could I have afforded bottled water or would I have to feed my daughter that water? It is not acceptable, not in the greatest country on the face of the  Mr.Pruitt doesn't know there is no safe level of lead allowed in the drinking water for children? Even low levels of lead can cause permanent brain damage in kids, lower IQs, and inflict other cognitive damage. There is no excuse for our Nation's EPA Administrator to not know that basic fact. That is a serious oversight, especially in the aftermath of the Flint water crisis. Lead in schools and in public waterways is a serious problem for Illinois children as well as for the children of It is a problem for families. It is a problem for families and for children all across this  The EPA should work proactively to prevent crises like in Flint and to protect America's water supplies, but Mr.Pruitt's record of filing lawsuit after lawsuit that challenge the EPA's authority to carry out its mission doesn't inspire much confidence that his goals are the same as the Agency's that he seeks to lead. The American people simply cannot afford to have someone with a well-documented history of putting corporate polluters' profits before our clean air and water leading the Agency that is meant to safeguard them--the  We are only starting to learn the extent of Mr.Pruitt's conflicts of interest, and we have an opportunity to learn more about these conflicts now that a State judge in Oklahoma has ordered Mr.Pruitt to release by Tuesday potentially thousands of emails he exchanged with fossil fuel interests in his job as the Oklahoma attorney general. Senate Republicans are forcing us to vote on Mr.Pruitt before Tuesday because they know the American people will be alarmed and shocked by what his correspondence will reveal.  Mr.Pruitt has shown he is unwilling and unable to do this job. I remember, during questioning in committee, he was asked what was the role of the He spent the majority of his answer talking about the Federal Government not infringing on States' rights and talking about pulling the Federal Government and the EPA out of the States' business. Only at the very end did he add, almost as an afterthought--oh, yes--``and to safeguard the water and the air.'' The name of the Agency is the Environmental Protection That should have been the first thing he said, not the last.  He doesn't understand the central public health and environmental challenges that face us. Instead of siding with people, he has chosen to side with corporate polluters. He doesn't have a single environmental accomplishment to his name. He is unqualified, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.  As someone who represents a farming State, I remember when President Trump came out to the Midwest and promised the American farmers that he would support the renewable fuel standard. I am deeply disappointed he has nominated someone to head the EPA who is clearly opposed to the renewable fuel standard.  I asked Mr.Pruitt several times in committee, in several different ways, if he would stand by the American farmer. I even told him what the right answer was--side with, stand with, protect the producers, and he refused to answer. He gave vague, evasive answers and refused to commit and refused to support the American farmer.  It is a no-brainer. Support the American farmer. Don't break the President's promise. Don't back away from the  Mr.Pruitt is continuing his administration's tradition of using alternative facts. The alternative to facts is fiction, and we cannot afford to have an Administrator who questions climate change. Climate change is an urgent threat to our Increasing temperatures are causing extreme weather events at alarming rates. We are witnessing more intense droughts, wildfires, and extreme weather across this country. If we put our heads in the sand and fail to curb the pollution that drives climate change, the effects will be devastating as our air quality will worsen, which will trigger more asthma attacks and other respiratory issues for our children; our coastal communities will be threatened by sea level rise; our national security will be threatened as climate change creates instability around the world.  ADM Mike Mullen, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Bush and Obama administrations, had this to say about climate change:[[Page S1322]]         Whatever the cause, climate change's potential impacts are      sobering and far-reaching. Glaciers are melting at a faster      rate, causing water supplies to diminish in Asia; rising sea      levels could lead to a mass migration and displacement      similar to what we saw in Pakistan's 2010 floods.  The National Intelligence Council's report, ``Global Trends 2030,'' made similar observations.  Their report states: ``Many developing and fragile states, such as in Sub-Saharan Africa, face increasing strain from resource constraints and climate change, pitting different tribal and ethnic groups against one another and accentuating the separation of various identities.''  Climate change, clean air, clean water, and fighting lead contamination are not partisan issues. We don't only have these issues in red States or blue States--they are universal--and the American people expect us to make sure the head of the Agency that is charged with safeguarding these vital health priorities will be able and willing to do the job.  Since Mr.Pruitt was nominated, I have heard concerns from thousands of my constituents. Let me share a few words that I have received from my home  This letter is from one of my constituents from  He writes:       I am asking you to vote ``no'' on Scott Pruitt's nomination      as Administrator of the Environmental Protection      America's clean water and air are a shining example for much      of the world, and the EPA is their defender. Mr.Pruitt      demonstrates no understanding of ocean acidification and the      urgent risk it poses to American marine life, fishermen, and      the communities that depend on them. Americans must protect      our water and air from further pollution while we work      collaboratively toward win-win solutions to challenges like      ocean acidification. Mr.Pruitt ignores established science,      and he is the wrong choice to lead the As my Senator,      please vote ``no'' on my behalf.  I hear you, and I share your concerns, and I will be voting no on Mr.Pruitt as Administrator of the  As you may know, EPA region 5 is based in my State, in I have heard from a number of EPA employees as well as from constituents--employees, both past and present--who are worried about the Agency they have served and loved. Here are some words from a former region 5 employee.  He writes:       Dear Senator Duckworth, I and many other former employees      of the Environmental Protection Agency want to share our      concern about Attorney General Scott Pruitt's qualifications      to serve as the next Administrator of the Our      perspective is not partisan. Having served under both      Republican and Democratic Presidents, we recognize the right      of a new administration to pursue new policies that protect      our environment, but the EPA's Administrator must act in the      public's interest and not simply advance the agendas of the      industries that it regulates.       Decisions that affect the public's health or natural      resources should respect the law and reflect the best      scientific evidence available. Mr.Pruitt's record and public      statements suggest that he does not share these values. As      Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr.Pruitt issued more than 50      press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn EPA standards      to limit mercury emissions from powerplants, reduce smog      levels in cities and regional haze in parks, clean up the      Chesapeake Bay, or control greenhouse gas emissions. In      contrast, none of Mr.Pruitt's press releases refer to any      action he has taken to enforce environmental laws or to      actually reduce pollution.       Of even greater concern, his statements frequently ignore      or misrepresent EPA's authority to regulate or its obligation      to do so under the Clean Air or Clean Water Mr.Pruitt      has shown little interest in the kind of scientific and      factual evidence that must guide EPA decisions. Mr.Pruitt      has said that humanity's contribution to global warming is      subject to considerable debate. That statement is at odds      with the consensus among scientists. Mr.Pruitt fails to      understand the difference between the public interest and the      private interest.  It is just amazing to me that we are even here, that this man was even nominated--someone who has sued the EPA, someone who has so clearly been in partnership with the fossil fuel industry and who has not put the interests of families and children first as opposed to the interests of the fossil fuel industry, which have been guiding him all the way.  I, in fact, was shocked to learn that Mr.Pruitt closed the Oklahoma Environmental Enforcement Unit established by his predecessor. Instead, he established a new litigation team to challenge the EPA and other Federal agencies. Let me say that again. When he became the Oklahoma attorney general, he closed the Oklahoma Environmental Enforcement Instead, he chose to start a new litigation team to challenge the EPA and other Federal agencies.  I did not see any indication from him, in his confirmation hearing, that he would not do the same once he gets to the Federal Perhaps that is the intent of the Trump administration, to bring someone in who will dismantle the That is why I am here tonight. That is why I am opposing him--because I put the needs of our children, the needs of our environment, and the needs of our national security in front of the needs of the biofuel industry. We need an Administrator who has the patience, skill, and commitment to public service in order to steer the EPA through challenges that are associated with protecting our public health.  I, too, cannot believe Mr.Pruitt has demonstrated that he has the qualities needed to lead the Environmental Protection I hope you will be happy to know that is why I am opposing his nomination.  A constituent from Deerfield, IL, wrote to me:       I am writing to ask that you raise your voice in Washington      against Scott Pruitt as President Trump's nominee for EPA            The EPA is an organization driven by science and dedicated      to protecting the climate and environment, not just for      Americans but for all citizens of the Mr.Pruitt, on      the other hand, disagrees with a vast majority of the      scientific establishment as to the extent of climate change      and humanity's role in it. He has made a name for himself by      opposing EPA's policies and missions in the past.       It is beyond me that anyone believes Mr.Pruitt could      effectively head the EPA and lead it further in its mission      to ensure we are responsible stewards of this planet's      environment and resources. I ask that you do your duty as a      citizen of this planet and vote ``no'' on Mr.Pruitt for this      position.       The EPA is an organization driven by science and dedicated      to protecting the climate and environment, not just for      Americans, but for all nations of the Mr.Pruitt, on      the other hand, disagrees with the vast majority of the      scientific establishment. Vote no on Mr.Pruitt for this      position.       I hope you all do your duty as representatives of the      American people by vocalizing our concerns with Mr.Pruitt to      your fellow Senators, urging them to see the fault in      President Trump's nomination.       Respectfully, Ethan, Deerfield,  Well, Ethan, I am doing exactly that. That is why I am here today--to make sure that our colleagues understand how poorly suited Mr.Pruitt is to this job of Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Here is a letter from a Ph.student from Northwestern       As a Northwestern University doctorate student, I have      chosen to devote my life to the pursuit of scientific      knowledge. I am deeply troubled by the nomination of Scott      Pruitt, and I am really concerned about the upcoming Senate      vote.       The head of the EPA must uphold basic science and should      not be colluding with the polluters they are required to      regulate. Scott Pruitt cannot be trusted to head the EPA, an      agency that is charged with protecting all Americans from      threats to their water, air, and health.       Pruitt is also out of step with the vast majority of      scientists, not only those working in the field of climate      change, but also those who have dedicated their lives to      protecting our air and water. As a scientific agency charged      with protecting the public's health according to the best and      most recent science, the EPA deserves to be headed by someone      with a scientific background, or at least an appreciation for      scientific truth.       I strongly urge you as my Senator to stand up for me and my      neighbors, and I oppose this nomination.       Thank you so much, Amanda Cook, from North Lakeview Avenue      in  Well, Amanda, I get it. I am with you. I, of course, did not pursue a Ph.in a scientific field, but it doesn't take a Ph.in a scientific field to know that a man who has sued the EPA over a dozen times is not someone suitable to lead the EPA; that a man who said that he doesn't know whether climate change truly is scientific fact should not be the man who is going to head the Agency enforced with dealing with the effects of global warming. He should not be the person who is in charge of the Agency that will be protecting our air and our water supply.  We have not even touched on what the costs will be to this Nation if we continue to neglect the well-being of our environment. Rising rates of asthma of our children will mean higher[[Page S1323]]medical costs. Lead in the water supply causing cognitive damage to our children will mean that additional resources must be spent in our schools in order to provide those children with the best opportunities that they can have to grow and thrive and will also result in greater medical bills to treat those children for the rest of their lives.  If you don't believe me, just ask the people of Flint, They are dealing with it every single day--every single day--those parents of children who have now been affected by the lead in that water supply. And Mr.Pruitt chooses to defend and protect the needs of the biofuels industry over the needs of our children. That is not someone worthy of representing the American people. That is not someone worthy of heading this  Let's just stick to Mr.Pruitt's own words, not the words of others, not the words of my constituents, but his own words. This is what he said about the Agency that he has been chosen to lead. Mr.Pruitt describes himself as ``a leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.'' He said this on his LinkedIn page. We accessed this in January of 2016.  On the role of the EPA he says:       I believe the EPA has a role to play in our Republican form      of government. Air and water quality issues can cross State      lines and can sometimes require Federal intervention. At the      same time, the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's      frontline environmental regulator.  This was his testimony before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in May of 2016.  I disagree with you. I disagree with you, Mr.Pruitt, because I was there at that hearing where there were both State EPA officials as well as Federal EPA officials trying to explain why they allowed Detroit's children to be poisoned. And the Federal EPA official knew about the lead in the water supply--in fact, had discovered it--and they were so timid about pursuing it that they waited too long and allowed the State to continue to move forward. Those Federal EPA officials were indeed on the frontline.  I asked the Regional Administrator, Would you not rather be in front of this committee today explaining why you acted too quickly to save the health and the future well-being of the children of Flint than to be here in front of us today explaining why you allowed them to be poisoned, and not exercise your right as the Federal EPA to step in when the health and well-being of American citizens were at stake?  So Mr.Pruitt, I disagree with you. The EPA was indeed intended to be one of our Nation's frontline environmental regulators.  On climate change, Mr.Pruitt has said:       Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists      continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global      warming and its connections to the actions of mankind. That      debate should be encouraged in classrooms, public forums, and      the halls of  He is actually arguing that we should be teaching false science and should be encouraging it in classrooms and public forums. I can't think of something that would be a greater disservice to America than for the EPA Administrator to be someone who actually looks at scientific data--proven scientific data, facts--and rejects them. Yet, we know why he does. We know from his history. We know from his record in He does it because the fossil fuel industry tells him so.  This is what he said about the Clean Power Plan:       The President could announce the most ``state friendly''      plan possible, but it would not change the fact that the      administration does not have the legal authority under the      Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions.  Yes, it does. Yes, it does, Mr. He just said that in August of 2015.  Here is what he said on methane regulation:       My concern is that EPA is employing its flawed methodology      in order to rationalize new and unjustified Federal      regulations to solve a methane emissions problem that simply      does not exist.  This man does not believe in global warming. This man does not believe in scientific data.  If you don't believe the scientists, at least look at what is happening with the storm systems, with what is happening to the climate that is changing and affecting this Nation with increased drought, increased flooding, more severe weather, and erosion. We had the first climate change refugees of Louisiana where people who have lived for generations in the gulf have now seen their islands washed away and have to be resettled.  Even if you don't believe in the data, believe your eyes and believe the facts.  Mr.Pruitt also said:       The record does not support EPA's finding that mercury      poses public health hazards. Human exposure to methylmercury      resulting from coal-fired EGUs is exceedingly small.  That is simply untrue.  On legislating, he has said:       Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make      clean air.'' That is what bothers me, that Congress gives      this general authority to  On Oklahoma's race to the bottom on environmental regulations--this has to do with the Federal regional haze standards--Mr.Pruitt said:       These standards threaten the competitive edge Oklahoma has      enjoyed for years with low cost and reliable electric      generation. This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma      manufacturers but gives us a considerable edge in recruiting      new jobs.  He would rather increase the haze and the pollution in the environment. He would rather have an economic edge at the expense of the people of Oklahoma who must live and breathe more polluted air.  This is what he said on the renewable fuels standard:       The evidence is clear that the current ethanol fuel mandate      is unworkable. The decision by the EPA to lower that standard      is good news for Oklahoma consumers.  What he means is that it is good news for Oklahoma's fossil fuel producers. In fact, the renewable fuel standards have been a success and we should be adhering to them and we should be keeping the renewable fuel standards and supporting the producers.  I will bet on the American farmer any day of the week. Our farmers work hard. Our farmers produce the corn for ethanol right here in the United I would rather invest in them than in foreign oil. I would rather invest in them and in a fuel that is clean-burning versus a fuel that pollutes the environment for the next generation of our  Even if you don't believe in the science, believe in the dollars. Ethanol and biofuels employ tens of thousands of hard-working Americans all across this great It accounts for large proportions of the economies of the farming States, including Illinois, Iowa, So even if you don't believe, you should at least support our farming communities.  It is a fact that Scott Pruitt is simply too extreme to lead the He once wrote an entire op-ed questioning the science of climate change. He said:       Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists      continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global      warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.  This is according to an op-ed written by Scott Pruitt in the Tulsa  He goes on:       Healthy debate is the lifeblood of American democracy, and      global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled.  I agree that healthy debate is important to democracy, but when that debate is over and becomes an item of fact, it is just simply silly, and in the case of clean air and clean water and climate change, it gets to be dangerous.  His climate denial goes against the scientific community. Ninety-seven percent of scientists, including those at NASA, agree that human activities are causing climate change.  The 18 major national scientific organizations issued a joint statement with the following conclusion:       Observations throughout the world make it clear that      climate change is occurring and rigorous scientific research      demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human      activities are the primary driver.  Mr.Pruitt's climate denial is also against the will of the American people. In fact, a New York Times/Stanford poll from 2015 showed that 77 percent of Americans support government action to combat climate change. This poll found that 83 percent of Americans, including 61 percent of Republicans, say that if nothing is done to[[Page S1324]]reduce emissions, global warming will be a serious problem in the future. Seventy-seven percent of Americans, according to this poll, say that the Federal Government should be doing a substantial amount to combat climate change.  In a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll from 2009, 67 percent of Americans stated that they supported EPA action to curb carbon pollution from powerplants, while only 29 percent opposed them. In that same poll, 57 percent supported requiring companies to cut emissions even if it means higher power bills. This was an increase from 48 percent in October of 2009 to the poll that was conducted in June of 2014.  Mr.Pruitt's blatantly anti-environment agenda threatens public health. He is unfit to lead an Agency that he sued at every turn to block protections for clean air and water. He sued the EPA over the legality of the Clean Power He claims that the EPA does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.  Since becoming Oklahoma's top legal officer in 2011, Mr.Pruitt has unsuccessfully attempted to stop vital protections of public health--unsuccessfully. This includes standards for reducing soot and smog pollution that crosses interstate lines; protections against emissions of mercury, arsenic, acid gases, and other toxic pollutants from powerplants; and standards to improve air quality in national parks and wilderness areas. Each time he has done this, he has failed. Yet he continues to file suit.  He did many of these suits in conjunction with the fossil fuel industry. Some of those suits are still outstanding. Yet he has said--he has refused to commit to recusing himself from any of these lawsuits that may come in front of the EPA while he is the Administrator of the That is a conflict of interest. He will simply become the plaintiff, the judge, and the jury if he does not recuse himself. But of course that is his goal. His goal is to dismantle the His goal is to dismantle the Clean Water His goal is to take away the authority of the EPA to regulate and protect those activities that affect our environment.  Mr.Pruitt launched three separate failed lawsuits against EPA's clean air rules, the regional haze cross-state air pollution rule, and the mercury and air toxics protections, otherwise known as The Supreme Court flat-out rejected Mr.Pruitt's challenges to the EPA's mercury standards. Thank God, because it protects millions of children from the effects of mercury, arsenic, and other dangers neurotoxins from coal plants.  Mr.Pruitt wants to block the EPA's clean water rule, which will protect the drinking water for over 117 million--that is one in three--One in three Americans gets drinking water from streams that lacked clear protections before the clean water rule.  According to analysis of over 1,200 peer-reviewed scientific reports, small streams and wetlands play a critical role in the health of larger downstream bodies, such as rivers, lakes, bays, and coastal waters.  Mr.Pruitt doesn't even want the EPA to study fracking's potential links to water contamination. As recently as 2014, he sent a letter to the EPA Office of Inspector General warning against preliminary research into threats to water resources posed by hydraulic fracturing. He said he believed EPA's efforts to study whether fracking was linked to groundwater contamination was politically motivated. He is even afraid of a study. Not only is he trying to block the EPA's ability to regulate, he doesn't even want the EPA to study it. He doesn't even want it to have the chance to develop the data to show that our water supply is under danger from fracking.  This man doesn't believe in scientific data, but he is afraid of it. If he weren't afraid of it, he would support these studies because they would show that he was right. But here is the problem: He is not right. He is wrong. The scientific data shows that such activities pollute our water supply.  Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly failed to act to protect the people of Oklahoma from increasingly powerful earthquakes caused by fossil fuel extraction through the process of fracking as well. We have had a string of level 5 magnitude earthquakes hit the State of Scientists have indicated that they are being caused by a dramatic rise in the use of hydraulic fracturing--fracking--to produce oil and gas. The problem lies in the massive volumes of wastewater unearthed in the process of unlocking oil and gas. Operators typically dump salty wastewater, injecting high volumes of fluid into the disposal wells dug thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, but the pressure from wastewater is wreaking havoc on Oklahoma's fault lines.  The Oklahoma Geological Survey bluntly concluded last year that it was very likely that the majority of earthquakes that ripped through the central and northern regions of the State were caused by this process of injecting wastewater into disposal wells. This was reported by NBC News in November of 2016.  In 2016, the National Review reported that Mr.Pruitt compared taking on Big Oil to offenses committed by the British leading to the American It said:       The United States was born out of a revolution against, in      the words of the Declaration of Independence, an ``arbitrary      government'' that put men on trial for ``pretended offenses''      and ``abolish[ed] the Free System of English laws.'' Brave      men and women stood up to that oppressive government, and      this, the greatest democracy of them all, one that is      governed by the rule of law and not by men, is the product.  Some of our States have forgotten this founding principle and are acting less like Jefferson and Adams and more like George  A group of Democratic attorneys general has announced it intends to criminally investigate oil and gas companies that have disputed the science behind manmade global warming. Backed by green energy interests and environmental lobbying groups, the coalition has promised to use intrusive investigations, costly litigations, and criminal prosecutions to silence critics of its climate change agenda. This is from the National  He is comparing the efforts to take on Big Oil to offenses committed by the British leading to the American I will take on Big Oil any day. I think it is important for our Nation's future.  As we have heard during the course of this debate, those of us who are troubled by the prospect of Mr.Pruitt becoming EPA Administrator believe that the process to this point has been marred by his failure to provide us with the information we feel we need to evaluate his suitability to serve in this critical role. Meanwhile, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that Mr.Pruitt has been fully forthcoming. So let's put this dispute aside and turn our attention to a question Mr.Pruitt did answer. It may be among the most revealing of his responses. Unfortunately, what his answer reveals is the precise reason so many of us and so many of the people we represent are opposed to his confirmation and convinced he is absolutely the wrong person to head the agency.  Senator Carper asked Mr.Pruitt: Are there any other EPA regulations that are on the books today that you do support?  Mr.Pruitt declined to name a single one. Not one. He has many that he could choose from. In fact, the question should have been something of a softball, in my view, giving him a chance to embrace the EPA's core mission as a public health He couldn't find a single regulation that he could support within the The man who is supposed to be heading the EPA could not think of a single regulation of this Agency that he could support.  Instead, what Mr.Pruitt does not seem to grasp is that EPA regulations are not simply policies to be litigated. In reality, they are lifesaving protections for so many Americans, and they create millions of dollars of net benefits.  Let's take a look at some of the public health environmental protections Mr.Pruitt cannot bring himself to support.  The mercury and air toxic standards have been projected to save up to 11,000 lives annually from premature deaths--11,000 lives annually from premature deaths, saved because of these regulations. They also prevent heart attacks and avoid 5,700 emergency room visits. That translates into over $80 billion in net benefits in a single year. That is a lot of lives saved, illnesses avoided, and economic benefits created that a[[Page S1325]]would-be EPA Administrator can't bring himself to support.  Of course, we should have expected Mr.Pruitt to name that rule since he has sued to block it twice, the second time being after EPA modified the rule to address concerns raised by the Supreme Perhaps the number of rules we could expect Mr.Pruitt to support is a bit smaller than we might have thought since he blocked so many of them. In case after case after case, he has sued to block the EPA from working to save lives, prevent illnesses, and create economic benefits.  He has sued on behalf of Oklahoma to block the cross-state air pollution rule, otherwise known as the good neighbor rule. That rule cuts the pollution that leads to dangerous, sometimes deadly, urban smog and soot. When he sued, he was suing to block the American public from enjoying the following benefits: up to 34,000 lives saved per year, along with some $280 billion in health benefits.  When Mr.Pruitt brought an action against EPA's health-based standards for ground-level ozone, he was standing in opposition to the protections that would help avoid 660 premature deaths and over 230,000 asthma attacks, while creating $4.5 billion in health benefits net of cost. Even if you don't believe in the science, you should at least believe in the dollars and cents of the lives saved. Yet he continues to sue the EPA to oppose these regulations.  Although Mr.Pruitt has been a tireless litigator, he has not challenged every one of EPA's public health protections. But still, when asked, the man who wants to become the Administrator of the EPA could not name a single regulation of the Agency that he is about to take charge of that he supported. That means, for example, Mr.Pruitt probably doesn't support a rule that reduces the sulfur in gasoline so that emission control devices on cars can work more effectively. Don't we all want cars to work effectively? I guess he doesn't. This particular rule stands to create net benefits of up to $17.5 billion by 2030. Those dollar figures include the benefit of saving up to 2,000 lives and preventing 2,220 hospital admissions and asthma-related emergency room visits.  In 2015, the EPA set standards for the emissions of toxic air pollutants at refineries. As a result, 1.4 million fewer people will be exposed to cancer risks, yielding a 15- to 20-percent reduction in cancer incidents linked to refinery air pollution. According to his answer, Mr.Pruitt--who is seeking to be the EPA Administrator--doesn't support those advancements in public health.  He also doesn't support rules that are protecting the brain development of our children from exposure to lead in both gasoline and paint. Otherwise, he may have answered my colleague Mr.Carper by saying that he supported the highly successful gasoline lead phaseout that dates all the way back to 1988. That regulation produced health benefits to the tune of over $6 billion. He didn't even indicate that he supports a rule addressing childhood lead exposure and renovation repair and painting.  Mr.Pruitt didn't even tell us that he supports rules that put or keep money in the pockets of families and businesses along with the environmental benefits they deliver.  EPA's greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards for cars and light-duty trucks are calculated to save families $1.7 trillion--that is a ``t''--in fuel costs.  The EPA's 2012 rule limiting the emissions of volatile organic compounds in natural gas production were calculated to create up to $19 million in cost savings in 2015 alone because of the value of the material recovered in the process of controlling emissions. Those benefits, however, did not inspire Mr.Pruitt to support them.  The list of health protections Mr.Pruitt does not support goes on and on. It includes health-based standards for fine particles or soot which will achieve between $3.7 billion and $9 billion in health benefits net of cost.  All of the rules I have mentioned are just a representative sample, nowhere near an exhaustive list.  When Mr.Pruitt declined to name a single environmental regulation he supported, he showed us how little he supports the central mission of the EPA, which is not to produce rules and regulations but to take action that creates health, environmental, and economic benefits for the American people.  Clearly, along with much of the rest of his record, Mr.Pruitt is declining to tell us he does support the health and environment protection EPA has established. It shows why he is not a suitable candidate to lead this He has shown throughout his career that he has a blatantly anti-environmental agenda, and this agenda threatens public health. He is not fit to lead this Agency--an Agency that he has sued every single chance he has gotten to block protections for clean air and water. I wonder why he does that. I wonder why.  Well, this might be a reason why. According to the National Institute on Money and State Politics--we accessed this in December of last year, just a few months ago--it appears that Mr.Pruitt has received over $314,000 from fossil fuel industries since 2002. According to them, Scott Pruitt has received a total of $314,996. He received $8,201 in 2002, $76,970 in 2006, $112,150 in 2010, and $117,775 in 2014.  It keeps growing and growing. I guess he is being rewarded by the fossil fuel industry for suing the EPA over and over. I can't imagine why they would continue to give him more money, other than the fact that he keeps suing the  He has used letters written by Devon Energy lawyers to send to the According to the New York Times, he sent a letter to the EPA from his own office that was written by lawyers of Devon Energy, one of Oklahoma's big oil and gas companies, and was brought to him by their chief lobbyist. Their chief lobbyist, Mr.William Whitsitt, at the time directed government relations for the company, and had presented a note to Mr.Pruitt's office. Mr.Pruitt had taken Devon's draft, copied it onto State government stationery with only a few word changes and sent it to Washington with the attorney general's signature.  I don't think that is acceptable, and I certainly don't think that it is a suitable way for someone who is going to head the EPA to conduct himself.

I am also deeply concerned that we are holding this vote so quickly, when not all of the evidence of Mr.Pruitt's activities has been brought to light.

I don't understand why we would hold this vote so soon, so quickly, when there are other nominees for other positions in the President's Cabinet whom we could vote on, who do not have 2,000 hidden emails waiting to be released, waiting to be reviewed.

Why are we so eager to have this vote? Do you just want him to start dismantling the EPA that much sooner? Can't we wait a week? I think we are doing a disservice to the gentlemen and women who serve in this body. They deserve to have complete information before we hold this vote. I think those emails that would be disclosed deserve to be looked at. They deserve the light of day--transparency--so that we can continue to evaluate and truly have more complete information on Mr.Pruitt and his time as the Oklahoma State attorney general before we pass this vote.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a February 6 letter from nearly 500 former employees of the EPA to Leader  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 6, 2017.     Subject: Concerns about Scott Pruitt's qualifications to          serve as EPA     Mitch McConnell,     Washington,       Dear Senator McConnell and the U.Senate: We write as      former employees of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)      to share our concerns about Oklahoma Attorney General Scott      Pruitt's qualifications to serve as the next EPA      Administrator in light of his record in Our      perspective is not partisan. Having served under both      Republican and Democratic presidents, we recognize each new      Administration's right to pursue different policies within      the parameters of existing law and to ask Congress to change      the laws that protect public health and the environment as it      sees fit.       However, every EPA Administrator has a fundamental      obligation to act in the public's interest based on current      law and the best available science. Mr.Pruitt's record      raises serious questions about whose interests he has served      to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of      U.environmental law.       Our nation has made tremendous progress in ensuring that      every American has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink      and uncontaminated land on which to live, work and play.      Anyone who visits Beijing is reminded of what some cities in      the U.once looked like before we went to work as a people      to combat pollution. Much of EPA's work involves preserving      those gains, which should not be taken for granted. There are      also emerging new threats as well as serious gaps in our      environmental safety net, as the drinking water crisis in      Flint, Michigan, painfully demonstrates.       Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that      requires EPA to set national standards and gives states      latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum      criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that      Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no      matter where they live, and allows states to compete for      business without having to sacrifice public health or      environmental quality.       Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to      allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which      is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is      reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even      when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,      EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit      the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its      harmfulness to public health was erased. His action spared      much of the harm that some countries still face as result of      the devastating effects of lead on human health. Similarly,      early action to reduce exposure to fine particle pollution      helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from heart and      lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those risks did      not become apparent until much later.       Mr.Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest      that he does not share the vision or agree with the      underlying principles of our environmental laws. Mr.Pruitt      has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws, a      critically important function for While serving as      Oklahoma's top law enforcement officer, Mr.Pruitt issued      more than 50 press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn      EPA standards to limit mercury emissions from power plants,      reduce smog levels in cities and regional haze in parks,      clean up the Chesapeake Bay and control greenhouse gas      emissions. In contrast, none of Mr.Pruitt's many press      releases refer to any action he has taken to enforce      environmental laws or to actually reduce pollution. This      track record likely reflects his disturbing decision to close      the environmental enforcement unit in his office while      establishing a new litigation team to challenge EPA and other      federal agencies.       He has claimed credit for an agreement to protect the      Illinois River that did little more than confirm phosphorus      limits established much earlier, while delaying their      enforcement another three years.       In a similar vein, Mr.Pruitt has gone to disturbing      lengths to advance the views and interests of business. For      example, he signed and sent a letter as Oklahoma Attorney      General criticizing EPA estimates of emissions from oil and      gas wells, without disclosing that it had been drafted in its      entirety by Devon He filed suit on behalf of Oklahoma      to block a California law requiring humane treatment of      poultry. The federal court dismissed the case after finding      that the lawsuit was brought not to benefit the citizens of      Oklahoma but a handful of large egg producers perfectly      capable of representing their own interests. To mount his      challenge to EPA's rule to reduce carbon pollution from power      plants, he took the unusual step of accepting free help from      a private law firm. By contrast, there is little or no      evidence of Mr.Pruitt taking initiative to protect and      advance public health and environmental protection in his      state. Mr.Pruitt's office has apparently acknowledged 3,000      emails and other documents reflecting communications with      certain oil and gas companies, but has yet to make any of      these available in response to a Freedom of Information Act      request filed more than two years ago.       Contrary to the cooperative federalism that he promotes,      Mr.Pruitt has suggested that EPA should refrain from trying      to control pollution that crosses state lines. For example,      he intervened to support a Farm Bureau lawsuit that would      have overturned a cooperative agreement between five states      and EPA to clean up the Chesapeake Bay (the court rejected      the challenge). When asked how a state can protect its      citizens from pollution that originates outside its borders,      Mr.Pruitt said in his Senate testimony that states should      resolve these disputes on their own, with EPA providing      ``informational'' support once an agreement is reached. But      the 1972 Clean Water Act directs EPA to review state water      quality plans, require any improvements needed to make waters      ``fishable and swimmable,'' and to review and approve plans      to limit pollutant loads to protect water quality. EPA's      power to set standards and limit pollution that crosses state      lines is exactly what ensures every American clean air and      water, and gives states the incentive to negotiate and      resolve transboundary disputes.       We are most concerned about Mr.Pruitt's reluctance to      accept and act on the strong scientific consensus on climate      change. Our country's own National Research Council, the      principal operating arm of the National Academies of Science      and Engineering, concluded in a 2010 report requested by      Congress that human activity is altering the climate to an      extent that poses grave risks to Americans' health and      welfare. More recent scientific data and analyses have only      confirmed the Council's conclusion and added to the urgency      of addressing the problem.       Despite this and other authoritative warnings about the      dangers of climate change, Mr.Pruitt persists in pointing to      uncertainty about the precise extent of humanity's      contribution to the problem as a basis for resisting taking      any regulatory action to help solve it. At his Senate      confirmation hearing, he stated that that ``science tells us      that the climate is changing, and that human activity in some      manner impacts[[Page S1328]]     that change. The ability to measure with precision the degree      and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are      subject to continuing debate and dialogue, and well it should      be.'' This is a familiar dodge--emphasizing uncertainty about      the precise amount of humanity's contribution while ignoring      the broad scientific consensus that human activities are      largely responsible for dangerous warming of our planet and      that action is urgently needed before it is too late.       Mr.Pruitt's indulgence in this dodge raises the      fundamental question of whether he agrees with the      precautionary principle reflected in our nation's      environmental statutes. Faithful execution of our      environmental laws requires effectively combating climate      change to minimize its potentially catastrophic impacts      before it is too late.       The American people have been served by EPA Administrators,      Republicans and Democrats, who have embraced their      responsibility to protect public health and the environment.      Different administrators have come to different conclusions      about how best to apply the law in view of the science, and      many of their decisions have been challenged in court,      sometimes successfully, for either going too far or not far      enough. But in the large majority of cases it was evident to      us that they put the public's welfare ahead of private      interests. Scott Pruitt has not demonstrated this same      commitment.       Thank you for considering our views.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,2123,TRIBUTE TO BRIAN AND JOANNE LEBER,2017.0,16.0,February

201,topic-id,1792,"Mr.President, November 8, 2016, was not just election day. It was a day that will live in cyber infamy because it turns out that one of the leading enemies of the United States, the nation of Russia, was directly engaged in the Presidential campaign that resulted in the election on November 8. This is not speculation. It is a fact based on conclusions that came from 17 different intelligence agencies that confirmed this reality. This is the first time we can point to where a foreign power has tried to influence the outcome of a Presidential election in the United Their goal was clear: to elect Donald Trump, to defeat Hillary They hacked into computers. They released information on a selective basis. They created fake news stories. They used WikiLeaks--everything within their cyber power to influence the outcome of the election. That was the reality.  This morning we were awakened to the headline that President Trump's head of the National Security Council, LTG Michael Flynn, has resigned. That is an incredible blockbuster of a story. And what was the reason for his resignation? It turns out that he had a direct conversation with the Russian Ambassador to the United States, Mr.Kislyak, and that conversation included references to sanctions that President Obama was imposing on Russia because of their involvement in our election. What led to his resignation, of course, was that he misled both the Vice President and the President about that conversation. When the facts came out, he was forced to resign.  This is not business as usual in What we are dealing with here is, in fact, a historic event--a powder keg in history--when it comes to the United States and its security. The obvious question is, Will this Congress of the United States, this branch of our government, respond? Will we initiate thorough investigations as to the involvement of the Russians in that election campaign and, specifically, any involvement with any Presidential campaign during that time?  Twenty years ago, when I was elected to the Senate, there was an investigation initiated by the Republicans at the suggestion--the suggestion--that the Chinese Government played some role in the Clinton-Gore campaign. The Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate was entrusted with the responsibility to do a thorough investigation of that allegation, and Fred Thompson, the Senator from Tennessee, was the chairman of that committee, with John Glenn as the ranking  The hearings went on for weeks--ultimately, for months--and then there was a formal report issued. No credible evidence was found of the suggestion, but it was taken that seriously by the Republican-led Congress that the Chinese may have been involved in a Democratic Presidential campaign.  How seriously is the Republican Congress taking the allegations and statements from our intelligence agencies that the Russians were involved in this last Presidential campaign?  It is time for us to have an independent, bipartisan commission beyond Congress to look into this and give us solid answers. We need to appoint people to head this commission of the stature of GEN Colin Powell and Sandra Day O'Connor, who served on the Supreme Court, who are credible people to lead this effort and this investigation and give America the truth.  A week or so ago the New York Times published the results of a recent poll that asked Americans what other nations they considered to be our closest allies and worst enemies. The results weren't surprising. Canada, the UK, and Australia topped the list of our best allies. Of America's enemies, the top nations were different, but they included North Korea, Iran, and That makes me wonder why President Trump, in the span of a week, managed to insult and hang up on the telephone call with the Prime Minister of Australia and then go on national news to once again defend Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, in light of what I just said earlier. Just a few days later, it is revealed that his National Security Advisor, General Flynn, the one who was fired by the previous administration and led chants unworthy of a great democracy about locking up a political opponent, was, in fact, speaking to a Russian official as a private citizen before President Trump took office.  Monday, we learned that former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, whom President Trump abruptly fired, had warned the White House that General Flynn had misled senior administration officials about his communications with the Russian Ambassador and warned he was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Understand what I have just said. The man who was picked by President Trump as his top National Security Advisor misled the President and the Vice President about a telephone conversation with the Russian Ambassador and, in the opinion of our top law enforcement officials, left himself vulnerable to Russian blackmail.  In the last days of the Obama administration, then Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan reportedly shared Yates' concerns and concurred with the recommendation to inform the Trump White Now that General Flynn has resigned, leaving an already chaotic National Security Council in even greater disarray, perhaps this isn't all that surprising anymore, but it certainly should be.  This President has a troubling habit of lashing out at everyone and anyone involved in a perceived slight--dangerous and unbecoming behavior when granted the privilege to become President of this great In fact, the number and range of those attacked or insulted by Twitter is so significant I wouldn't even start to list them, but it is important to note the list includes Republicans, Democrats, labor leaders, businesses, retired generals, and others in almost every conceivable category. Actually, one looks at the list and you quickly realize the only unifying factor is not about putting America first or America's image but instead about protecting a deeply fragile ego.  Listen to this excerpt from a vast list of those who have been attacked by President Trump: President George Bush, President George Bush, Speaker Paul Ryan, Florida Rick Scott, Federal judges, former Governor of New Hampshire John Sununu, the Republican establishment, NATO, Major League Baseball, Macy's Department Store, European leaders, Britain, Germany, New Jersey, the American delegate system, the ``Today'' show, ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``The View,'' Chief Justice John Roberts, Colin Powell, President of United Steelworkers Local 1999, ABC News, NBC News, FOX News, and seemingly every other media outlet.  Now that we are in the category of those who have been attacked, we can't leave Nordstrom off the list. The President even insulted the former Governor of South Carolina, then chose her to be U.In fact, there are hundreds upon hundreds on this list--a list that in a foreboding, Nixonian way keeps on growing.  So if you make any criticism or joke about President Trump, make any perceived slight, run a department store that doesn't carry his daughter's products, lead a labor union, or do just about anything, be prepared for an attack by a Trump tweet--except if you happen to be the former Communist KGB official who now leads the one nation that actually recently attacked our That would be Vladimir  How is it possible?  Russian President Putin launched a cyber attack of war on the United[[Page S1137]]He interfered in our election and tried to affect the outcome and pick the winner. The evidence is overwhelming. It has been available in increasing amounts over the last several months. Yet we have a President who not only denies the Russian attack but has a strange infatuation with President Putin--but is also suggesting policies that dangerously puppet those of  It is now revealed that Trump's National Security Advisor, LTG Michael Flynn, lied about discussing sanctions with the Russian Ambassador immediately after the Obama administration announced new sanctions for the attack on our election. Not only had General Flynn and the White House suddenly remembered the facts differently, but more dangerously, did Flynn's conversation undercut U.sanctions, especially after Russia's assault on our election? And who instructed General Flynn to have these suspiciously timed conversations with the Russian Ambassador?  It is deeply troubling to imagine what might have been insinuated in those talks, but given the blinders this President has shown in ignoring President Putin so far, I worry about a suggested or hinted trading for U.sanctions on Russia for little in return.  Quite simply, you don't make America great by selling out to a former Communist KGB official. You only negotiate with such a dictator from a position of strength, not denial or naivete.  So what has been the response to the cyber attack of war on America, Flynn's dalliance with the Russians, and the dangerous disarray at the Trump National Security Council from the party of Ronald Reagan, who knew the Communist mind pretty well? Near silence. The party of Ronald Reagan has spoken zero times about the Russian attack or Flynn's actions on the floor of the Senate since early I waited this morning for the Senate Republican leader to raise the obvious front-page story across America about the resignation of President Trump's National Security Advisor, and not a word was mentioned.  Compare this to the 36 times the Republicans have come to the floor to talk about stripping health care away from millions of Americans in the last several weeks. Even President Trump's new Attorney General, who brazenly changed his tune on Russia once having joined the Trump campaign, said he had not yet read intelligence reports on the Russian attack--a position even more stunning in light of the recent reports of Sally Yates' warnings. Yet, incredibly, his colleagues were ready to confirm him for the highest law enforcement position in the land.  I see the Democratic leader here, and I want to yield the floor to him, but I will close with this. Are we going to have a fulsome, honest, independent investigation of the Russian involvement in this election campaign? We know it happened. Seventeen of our intelligence agencies confirm it.  We also know that an investigation is underway by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about this campaign and the involvement of the Russians, and we know as well now that because of the conversations of our National Security Advisor with the Russian Ambassador, he was forced to resign in the first 4 weeks of this administration.  This calls out for a thorough investigation. The Republican Party in Congress, which spent hours and days and weeks and months in investigations involving Hillary Clinton, should at least acknowledge the gravity of this matter and bring this to a full investigation--an open and public one that can be trusted, an independent investigation--that stands up for our basic democracy and does not allow the invasion of the Russians or any other country into our democratic process.

206,topic-id,2024,"Mr.President, later today we are going to consider an effort under the Congressional Review Act to change America's background check system when it comes to the purchase of firearms.  For months, I have been listening to President Trump and the Republicans talk about gun violence in the city of It is a heartbreaking reality. More than 4,300 people were shot in Chicago last year and over 400 so far this year. It is not just The American Medical Association has declared that gun violence is a public health crisis in our  So what is Congress doing to save lives in Chicago and across the Nation from gun violence? What is the Senate doing to protect people from being shot?  Instead, the Republican Congress is trying to weaken one of the gun laws on the books--the NICS Improvement Amendments This is the law passed unanimously by Congress after the Virginia Tech massacre and signed into law in 2008 by President George  This law says that every Federal agency needs to let the FBI NICS background check system know when the agency has information about people who fall within the legal prohibitions on gun possession. Everyone agreed we needed to get these records into the NICS system, especially records about those who are seriously mentally unstable, such as the Virginia Tech shooter. That man had a history of mental illness, but he was able to buy guns and kill 32 people because his records were not in the background check system known as  There is a longstanding Federal prohibition on gun possession by those who are suffering from mental illness. This prohibition is so well established that the late Justice Antonin Scalia cited it in the Supreme Court's Heller decision as an example of a restriction that is presumptively lawful and consistent with the Second  There have been tragic cases where people with serious mental illnesses have used guns to cause great harm. The Newtown, CT, shooter showed signs of severe mental health problems that went untreated before he killed 20 students and 6 educators at Sandy Hook Elementary The Tucson, AZ, shooter, who shot Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and killed six others, was diagnosed after the shooting with schizophrenia. And it was 9 years ago today when a gunman who had been diagnosed and treated for mental illness killed 5 people and injured 17 in a classroom building at Northern Illinois University in  About two-thirds of shooting deaths each year are suicides. Last year, there were more than 21,000 suicides by gun. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that ``about 90% of individuals who die by suicide experience mental illness.''  Mental illness is a challenging issue for our society. I have worked to expand treatment and coverage for mental illness, including through the Affordable Care Act, one of the most important single laws we have ever passed to address mental illness. I wish those who are trying to repeal this commonsense gun safety regulation would drop that effort and join us in stopping this repeal of the Affordable Care We need more and better services for people with mental illness.  The reality is that the gun laws on the books are narrowly drawn when it comes to mental illness and so is the rule we are being asked to repeal today. Current Federal law says that a person who has been ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is prohibited from gun possession. The phrase ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is defined in the law as a determination by ``a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease: (1) is a danger to himself or others; or (2) lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.''  The 2008 NICS Improvement law, signed into law by President George Bush, directed Federal agencies to send their relevant records to the NICS system. Last year, the Social Security Administration issued a rule to implement this law after concluding that certain determinations by the Social Security Administration qualify as an adjudication of mental defectiveness.  Let me explain what the SSA rule says. Under this rule, starting in December of this year, the Social Security Administration will begin sending to NICS--the body which gathers information and records for background checks before the possession of firearms--the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of people who meet each of the five threshold criteria. The person must be between the ages of 18 and 65, have filed a claim with SSA for benefits based on disability, have been diagnosed with a serious, long-term mental disorder, have been determined by SSA to be disabled and unable to perform substantial work because of the mental disorder, and have been subject to determination by the Social Security Administration that the mental disorder is so serious that the person needs to have a representative appointed to manage the person's benefits.  This is not a situation where the Social Security Administration would notify NICS just because a person can't balance his checkbook. There must be a seriously debilitating, medically diagnosed mental illness involved.  The rule is prospective only. Current Social Security disability beneficiaries are not subject to it. The rule is predicted to cover about 75,000 Americans, once it takes effect, out of the estimated 10 million suffering from a serious mental illness.  I might add here for the record, I do not suggest that every person who has any form of mental illness is a danger. In fact, exactly the opposite is true. But we do know that those who suffer from serious mental conditions many times are engaged in violent conduct and many times with horrible results when they have firearms.  The rule we are being asked to repeal on the floor of the Senate provides for advance notice of the Social Security Administration determination and the right to appeal through an administrative process and in court. A person can[[Page S1139]]obtain relief from the firearms prohibition by having healthcare providers and character witnesses submit statements that the person is not a danger to himself or others.  Every politician claims they want to keep deadly firearms out of the hands of those who are seriously mentally unstable. A statement made by a Republican Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn, the senior Senator from Texas and my counterpart on the Republican side; he said in March 2013:       If there was a common thread in the Virginia Tech, Tucson,      Aurora, and Newtown massacres, it was the mental illness of      the shooter. . . . We should refocus our effort to make sure      the current background check system works to screen out the      dangerously mentally-ill.  Reasonable people can disagree over whether the SSA's rule gets it exactly right. There are mental health groups that have concerns about it, and I respect that. But using the Congressional Review Act is a blunt tool. Instead of fixing the rule, the Congressional Review Act would repeal the rule and--listen to this--permanently bar the Social Security Administration from adopting any substantially similar rule. So it likely would bar the Social Security Administration from ever implementing a rule to submit mental health records to NICS in the future.  If there are problems with this rule, they can be addressed by fixing it. But the Republican response is always repeal first. This time, they want to repeal a rule that doesn't start until December and its repeal would preclude the Social Security Administration from even fixing or positively changing it.  We also had disputes over the process the Department of Veterans Affairs used to submit names of people with mental illness to the same NICS background check system. Last December, we fixed it on a bipartisan basis. We passed language in the 21st Century Cures Act to ensure that a person can have his own doctor and lawyer involved in the process. If the Social Security Administration rule needs fixing, we can fix it too. But this Congressional Review Act is a sledgehammer, not a tool to fix it.  We are being asked to vote today to ban an agency permanently from complying with the NICS law that we enacted in 2008. We are being asked to undermine the gun laws that are on the books.  I urge my colleagues to listen to the opposition of this resolution of disapproval. Read the letter from the U.Conference of Mayors, who say that the Social Security Administration rule ``is critically important to the fabric of our nation's background check system.'' Read the editorials in newspapers across the country that oppose repealing this rule.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Chicago Tribune be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Tribune, 10, 2017]       Editorial: Guns and Mental Illness: Don't Scrap This Rule                          (By Editorial Board)       If someone has a mental illness severe enough that he      cannot work or manage his own money, should he be allowed to      own a gun?       In the waning weeks of his presidency, Barack Obama      answered that question. Motivated by Adam Lanza's bloody      rampage at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that      killed 20 children and six educators in 2012, Obama imposed a      rule that barred gun ownership for people who qualify for      Social Security disability insurance because their mental      illness keeps them from working, and who cannot manage their      benefits. That pool is small--just 75,000       The GOP-led U.House just voted to scrap that rule. Bad      move. The Senate now decides whether to back that bad move.      If it does, President Trump would decide whether to go along      or disagree.       Republican lawmakers hang their case on the argument that      the rule stigmatizes people with disabilities as dangerous.      ``There are people who need help and seek help, but that is      not a criteria for taking away one's constitutional right''      to own a gun, Texas Pete Sessions said.       Sessions implicitly exaggerates the impact of the rule. As      gun control measures go, the scope of this one is narrow. Its      goal is to keep guns out of the hands of people on record as      having a disabling mental disorder. The standard for taking      that gun away is steep--they have to be on Social Security      because their psychiatric disorder keeps them from working,      and they cannot manage their own affairs. Both conditions      must be met. Even if the rule keeps someone from owning a      gun, that person can pursue an appeal.       America has seen what can happen when someone with severe      psychiatric issues has access to firearms. Their names and      crimes live in infamy:       In 2007, Seung Hui Cho shot to death 32 people at Virginia      Tech University before killing himself. Two years earlier, a      judge had deemed Cho an ``imminent danger'' because of mental      illness and ordered him to seek treatment. But because he was      never committed, that assessment never got recorded in the      federal database of people ineligible to buy guns. Cho passed      the background check and bought the guns he would wield at      Virginia       In 2011, Jared Loughner shot U.Gabrielle Giffords      in the head and murdered six other people in Tucson,       In 2012, James Holmes strode into a packed movie theater in      Aurora, Colo., and opened fire, killing 12 people.       And there's Lanza, who went through months of hysterical      crying, stretches of lethargy and self-imposed isolation from      his family before unleashing terror at Sandy Hook Elementary      ``I didn't understand that Adam was drifting away,''      his father, Peter Lanza, told The New Yorker in 2014.       These crimes showcase the dangers in allowing severely      troubled individuals to buy firearms. The rule the House      voted to scrap doesn't cast so wide a net that it applies to      anyone seeking psychiatric treatment. It's specific in scope,      and anchored by a common-sense premise that many House      Republicans ignored: If a person's psychiatric disorder is      disabling enough that the individual cannot work or deal with      money-managing, bright red flags are being raised about his      or her capacity for sound judgment.       To us, that's a logical, well-grounded reason why he or she      shouldn't own a gun.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1138-2.txt,326,CLOTURE MOTION,2017.0,14.0,February
207,topic-id,665,"We can also read editorials in the Louis Post-Dispatch, the Charlotte Observer, the New York Times, and more.  Now listen specifically to the pleas of gunshot victims and their family members. Listen to Patrick Korellis, of Chicago, whom I have met. He was shot in a classroom 9 years ago at Northern Illinois University by a man who had a serious mental illness. He wrote to me and he said:       I was shot in my classroom by someone who was mentally ill,      and was able to obtain guns and a lot of ammunition because      the background checks weren't strong enough. Rolling back      some of these background checks doesn't make any sense, and      will allow more people to get through the loopholes.  Now listen to Janet Delana of Wellington, She wrote to Congress:       My daughter Colby, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who      lived at home with her father and I, received monthly Social      Security disability payments for her mental illness. In 2012      she used the money from her disability check to buy a gun at      a local gun dealer. Because she was ill and suicidal, I had      contacted the gun dealer and begged him not to sell her a      gun. However, my pleas were ignored and the dealer sold her a      gun anyway because Colby passed the background check. An hour      later, she shot her father to death and tried once again to      take her own life. She is now in an institution for life, and      my husband is gone.  Janet said:       This SSA Rule is vital. I am very concerned this resolution      would preclude SSA and possibly even other agencies from      enacting any future regulations on this or related matters.  We have a public health crisis when it comes to gun violence--in Chicago and in communities across the We have a responsibility to do what we can on the Federal level to reduce the violence and protect our citizens from getting shot. Voting for this resolution of disapproval today would be a step backward. It would weaken the gun laws on the books and make it easier for severely mentally ill people to get guns. On this, the ninth anniversary of the shooting at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, it is unthinkable that we are going to try to revoke a rule that would keep guns out of the hands of those who should have no business owning them.  Let me conclude with a statement from Bloomberg business magazine, published in an edition several weeks ago:       Advocates for the mentally ill caution that mental illness      shouldn't be equated with a penchant for violence. They're      right. But America's tragic experience with mentally ill      gunmen--from shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 to Newtown,      Connecticut, in 2012--shows the folly of simply dismissing      the danger.       In recent years Republicans have prioritized instant      gratification for anyone who desires to buy a gun. Last year      the National Rifle Association spent $50 million on the      campaigns of Donald Trump and six Republican senators. NRA      leader Wayne LaPierre, who met with Trump this week, wants      payback.       The Obama rule established a process for identifying only      Social Security beneficiaries who would be prohibited from      possessing guns under existing law. It required[[Page S1140]]     that beneficiaries be notified of the prohibition, and it      provided means to appeal the determination before an      administrative law judge or a federal court.       Such provisions would safeguard individual rights. But they      offend the fundamental principle that drives the NRA, and      thus Republican, gun politics: Anyone should be able to get a      gun at any time for any reason and bring that weapon, loaded,      anywhere.  Common sense dictates that we be careful to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them. I sincerely hope that gun owners across my State and across the Nation--and I respect them and their constitutional right--will understand that reasonable limitations on the possession and ownership of firearms is in the best interest of protecting their Second Amendment rights as well.

570,topic-id,4213,"Mr.President, pending before the U.Senate is the nomination of Mick Mulvaney, a Congressman who is seeking to be the Director of the Office of Management and  If you were to ask the people of America about the Cabinet positions filled by the President, the one they probably would miss is the Office of Management and It turns out to be one of the more important positions, but it is not as well known historically as Treasury Secretary, Secretary of State, and Attorney It is an important job. It is one of the most consequential jobs because the Director of the Office of Management and Budget is responsible for preparing the President's budget, setting the priorities of the Federal budget, and overseeing the performance of Federal agencies. It is a big and challenging job.  Many other nominees for positions in the Cabinet are well known and have been debated on the floor of the Today I come to say a few words about the record of this Congressman, Mick Mulvaney, who is seeking this directorship of the Office of Management and It is a very interesting record.  It is not unusual for Members of the House and the Senate to have unusual positions on issues. I guess each one of us has something we believe intensely that other people question. When it comes to Congressman Mulvaney, there is a long litany of positions he has taken that are far out of the mainstream of either political party. Yet President Donald Trump decided this is the man, this is the person he wanted to head up his budgeting effort. This is the person he wants to set the priorities for spending in the United States of America during his  If you look at the record of Mick Mulvaney, you will find that he has had an eagerness to dictate large and draconian cuts across the Federal Government in some of our most important and most cherished programs. Let me tell you about a few that highlight his record in Each one of these that I will speak to, if advanced by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, would have far-reaching consequences on families and individuals across the United States, not only in the operation of government but also in the effectiveness of our Federal workforce.  To start with--and this, I think, is the right place to start--Congressman Mulvaney, who seeks the position of Director of the Office Management and Budget, has repeatedly led efforts to shut down the Federal When Mr.Mulvaney and the Republicans succeeded in shutting down the government for 16 days in 2013, it cost the American economy $20 billion. Do you remember that?  Rush Limbaugh got on his radio show and said: If they shut down the government, no one will even notice.  Guess what, Mr.They noticed.  All across America, working families paid the price for that foolish political act of shutting down the government. The real cost of the government shutdown is not just measured in dollars. The real cost is in hardships unnecessarily created, hardships for Federal employees who didn't receive their checks on a timely basis, hardships for people struggling to survive in America, who relied on programs like food stamps. We call them SNAP benefits now. They had their food in jeopardy and endangered because Congressman Mulvaney and his friends thought that a display of political power--shutting down the government--was the right recipe for  These government shutdowns delayed 2 million Federal workers from receiving their checks, real people with real families to feed. Congressman Mulvaney doesn't seem to care about these real-world consequences of a shutdown. Instead, he called the shutdown of the Federal Government ``good policy.'' Those are his words: ``good policy.''  Then, when we finally reached an agreement to reopen the government, he was one of the few Members of the House to vote against the compromise in reopening the government.  In recent years, he has repeated his calls. He is willing to shut down the government of the United States of America to defund Planned This man wants to craft our national budget, and he would shut down the government over one provision in that budget? That is what he said.  Time and again, he has taken extreme positions on the Federal budget. We have a standing tradition in the House and the Since not one of us can predict when the next natural disaster is going to occur, we try to help one another.  I have voted for funds during the course of my congressional career for disasters in probably every State in the union. Do you know why? Because I knew the day would come--and it did, several times during my tenure in the House and Senate--when there would be a natural disaster in my State, and we needed a helping hand, emergency disaster assistance. That is a tradition which has been around Congress--I can go back almost centuries to see it in past history.  Listen to what Congressman Mulvaney did. He tried to block emergency disaster assistance to States that desperately needed the help of the Federal Government in their recovery efforts. He offered a poison pill amendment to the Hurricane Sandy relief package that would have required across-the-board cuts in military spending--military spending--to pay for disaster relief from Hurricane Then he went further and said: Not just military spending, I want cuts in entitlement programs--Medicare, Let's cut the healthcare assistance for Americans to pay for that disaster. That is his idea of social justice.  Despite President Trump's campaign promises to rebuild the Nation's crumbling infrastructure, Congressman Mick Mulvaney has taken an extraordinary and extreme view. He wants to eliminate Federal funding for transportation projects. He cosponsored a bill that would slash the Federal gas tax. That is how we pay for repairing Federal roads and mass transit across He isn't interested in fixing the highway trust fund solvency problems. His solution is to bankrupt it.  This is the man who wants to write the budget for America? His extreme ideology would threaten billions of dollars that my State receives in Federal transportation funds. We put money into the Federal highway trust fund,[[Page S1195]]too, every time we buy a gallon of gas in He would cut back on the resources coming back to my State and others to repair the very roads we drive on.  He has consistently supported across-the-board cuts for the Department of Defense, regardless of those affected. Just a few minutes ago, Senator John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, came to the floor to announce that because of Congressman Mulvaney's positions on cuts in the military, he--Senator McCain--would oppose the appointment of Mulvaney as head of Senator McCain said that it is a rare day when he comes out against a Presidential nominee of his own party. But he thinks Mulvaney's record is worrisome, and I couldn't agree more. The positions that Congressman Mulvaney has taken are reckless and would jeopardize the economic security of working families and put our Nation and economy at risk.  Possibly one of the most troubling positions that Congressman Mulvaney has taken is the fact that he is opposed to the Federal Government spending funds for medical research. Last year when Congress was deliberating how to combat the Zika virus, Representative Mulvaney wrote this on his Facebook page: ``Do we really need government-funded research at all?''  Let's think about that for a moment. Do we really need government-funded medical research in the United States? Do we need the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the Veterans' Administration investing in trying to find new cures for diseases?  Government-funded research in the Department of Defense has produced fascinating insights into the biology of breast cancer that have greatly impacted the treatment of that disease and saved lives in Look at the revolutionary Department of Defense-funded work that led to the development of the innovative drug Government-funded research, which Congressman Mulvaney does not believe we should do, at the National Institutes of Health has accomplished the following. It has cut the U.cancer death rate by 11 percent in women and 19 percent in men. And Congressman Mulvaney says: Do we really need to do that? Is that important? I would guess that his family, like every family in America, has a story to tell about cancer--what it has meant, the devastation it has created, the deaths that have resulted.  But Congressman Mulvaney doesn't get it. He just doesn't understand anything as basic as investing in medical research to save lives. HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence in I saw Magic Johnson just a few weeks ago at a farewell party for President I remembered the day in the House of Representatives when I was told that he had We assumed he would die in just a short period of time. But that was over 25 years ago. He has survived because of research that was done at the National Institutes of Health, and he is not alone. There are thousands just like him.  When I was a kid, polio was something every mother and father were frightened of. What in the world was happening? How could your child be infected with polio and end up being crippled for life? Our Republican leader here, Mitch McConnell, went through that in his childhood and has talked about that episode in his life and how devastating it was. He has had a full life since then, but he has overcome the problems of that disease. I remember as a kid in grade school, when they announced that our government research had come up with a vaccine that would protect kids from polio. That, to me, was a breakthrough, and one that I welcomed and our family welcomed.  Congressman Mulvaney questions whether or not medical research should continue, even in the light of the achievements in eradicating polio and small pox and other diseases in our country. These advances didn't just magically happen because of the miracle of the marketplace. They occurred because of sustained taxpayer investment in Federal medical research.  I will tell you this. If he wants to make a referendum in the Senate or the House on medical research a part of his budget debate, I welcome the challenge. I believe that Members of both political parties would stand up for medical research, despite Congressman Mulvaney's extreme positions.  So when someone asks if we really need government-funded medical research, the answer on behalf of cancer patients who are beating the disease, on behalf of HIV/AIDS patients who are living longer and normal lives, on behalf of all those families hoping and praying that some Federal researcher will come up with a breakthrough for Alzheimer's, for autism, or Parkinson's or diabetes--the answer, Congressman Mulvaney, is unequivocally, yes. America needs to invest in medical research. And the fact that you would question it really raises the question of your judgment.  Let me tell you another thing that he is for, which I think is the single most irresponsible budgetary position he has taken. He has been an opponent of raising the country's debt ceiling.  What is the debt ceiling? That is America's mortgage. That is the amount of debt we incur as a nation. It is a mortgage that is incurred for things that we have already spent money on. So when we come and vote for $600 billion for the Department of Defense and the intelligence agencies and we don't have enough money coming in taxes to pay for it, we have to extend America's mortgage to cover it. Congressman Mulvaney says that is the wrong thing to do--extending the debt ceiling of this country. While running for Congress, Congressman Mulvaney, who now wants to manage our Nation's budget, pledged he would never ever vote to raise the country's debt ceiling. He voted against it four different times.  In 2011, when we were just about to breach the debt limit and default on our national debt for the first time in the history of our country, Mulvaney was a leading voice in support of default. He called it a ``fabricated crisis,'' and accused both parties of ``fear mongering.''  I am not sure what is more disturbing--Mr.Mulvaney's willingness to default on our country's obligations, the full faith and credit of the United States, or his lack of appreciation for the devastating economic consequences which would follow. I can tell you what is at risk with that kind of reckless attitude toward our Nation's debt. What is at risk are the savings and investments and retirement accounts of ordinary Americans across the Mr.Mulvaney may be willing to gamble the full faith and credit of the United States; I am not. Forcing the Federal Government to default on the Nation's debt would harm the economy and affect the government's ability to make payments to Social Security and Medicare recipients, military personnel, veterans, Federal employees, defense contractors, State governments, and to the bondholders of the United States, here and overseas.  We would lose our credibility if Mr.Mulvaney had his way and allowed us to default on our national debt. We should not ever consider confirming an OMB Director who has repeatedly risked the economic security of our Nation to score political, rhetorical points.  Throughout his campaign, President Trump promised to protect Medicare and Social Security and make decisions that would ``benefit American workers and American families.'' That is a quote. However, instead of making good on the promise, President Trump has chosen a man to head the Office of Management and Budget who has led calls for devastating cuts to Federal programs that millions of Americans rely on every day.  Mr.Mulvaney has said he wants to ``end Medicare as we know it,'' and he has called Social Security a ``Ponzi scheme.'' He has called for raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70, from the 67 that it currently is. Well, 3 more years at work may not mean much to a Member of Congress, because we sit down a lot in these comfortable chairs and people bring us things when we need them. But 3 more years of working before you qualify for Social Security means something to a waitress, whose hips and ankles and knees have been bothering her for years, but she has no choice but to get up every morning, go to work, carry those trays, and try to bring enough money home to help a family. It means something to someone who works in a coal mine--I guarantee you that--3 more years at work, exposing yourself to the lung diseases and other things[[Page S1196]]that might come with the job. It means something to a truckdriver, spending days and nights on the road. It means something to people who have to move freight around. It is the kind of thing that means a lot to ordinary working people. It clearly doesn't mean anything to Congressman Three more years working, as far as he is concerned, is an acceptable alternative.  He wants to privatize Medicare and turn Medicare back into the loving arms of private health insurance companies, and let's see what seniors end up experiencing. Almost 60 million Americans now rely on In Congressman Mulvaney's point of view, the guarantee of Medicare would end. This is the man President Trump has chosen to head the budget for the United States of Mulvaney has called repeatedly for cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, including a ``cut, cap, and balance'' budget, which would cut each of these programs by 25 percent. When you say the word Medicaid, people have an image in their mind: Oh, that is health insurance for poor people. And that is generally correct, although it also covers disabled But do you know who the major recipients of Medicaid are in America? The largest single group of people receiving help from Medicaid are children--children in poor, low-income families who get medical care through The biggest expenditure for Medicaid is not children though. The biggest expenditure is for the elderly Americans who are living largely at institutional settings, in these care homes, nursing homes. Medicaid keeps them in that place with adequate medical care. So now comes Congressman Mulvaney and says: Let's just cut those by 25 percent. There is one good way to reduce Federal spending.  Really? So that means fewer immunizations for children. What does it mean for your mother or your grandmother in the nursing home when it is announced that we don't have enough money to cover the cost to keep her here in a good, safe, positive environment? For Congressman Mulvaney, it is just numbers on paper. For real families across America, it is the reality of life.  Much like our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman Price, Representative Mulvaney wants to dramatically undermine the Medicare Program for our Nation's seniors. Let's look at what Medicare has meant to our country since it was created in 1965. Before Medicare, only 51 percent of Americans 65 and older had health care coverage. Nearly 30 percent lived in poverty. Today, 98 percent of seniors have health care, and less than 10 percent live below the poverty line. Has Medicare work? You bet it has. It has provided health insurance for seniors, and it has given people dignity and independence in their senior years--something that everyone should value. And, incidentally, the life expectancy of Americans has grown by 5 years since we created It is working. Medicare helps seniors, helps their families, and it helps But Congressman Mulvaney doesn't get it.  This man has been chosen by President Trump to write the budget of Why is Congressman Mulvaney so hell-bent on ending a program like Medicare that 98 percent of our Nation's seniors depend on? Well, I can tell you, if his comments on Medicare scare you, on Medicaid he is even worse. This program, combined with the Children's Health Insurance Program, ensures health coverage for 70 million One out of every five nationwide depend on It helps low-income families, pregnant women, children, and those with disabilities. Currently, if you qualify for Medicaid, you are guaranteed to get health coverage. Congressman Mulvaney thinks he has a better idea. He wants to change that.  Congressman Mulvaney wants to significantly cut the Federal funding for Medicaid and leave States to fend for themselves when it comes to caring for these 70 million Faced with less Federal funding, States would be forced to find ways to cut spending and save money. They might start Medicaid waiting lists or impose work requirements or slash benefits. At the end of the day, the result would be catastrophic.  I just spent the last weekend in Southern We had a roundtable down there to talk about the impact of the repeal of the Affordable Care These hospital administrators from smalltown hospitals came in to tell me that losing Medicaid reimbursement could force them to dramatically cut their workforce and maybe even face closure. Here is Congressman Mulvaney suggesting: Let's just do that across I wonder where he lives. I wonder if there are any small towns or rural areas near him. I wonder if he values those hospitals the way the people living in communities that I represent value them. These are not only lifelines for people who desperately need timely, professional medical care, but they are the source of the best jobs in the community. Congressman Mulvaney could care less: Let's just keep cutting on Medicaid and see what happens.  What will happen will be devastating.  Mr.Mulvaney isn't content with just throwing seniors off Medicare and low-income families off He wants to punish women by taking away their healthcare providers and inserting his own decisions into their medical decisions. Mr.Mulvaney has repeatedly attempted to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide women and men with important cancer screenings, family planning, STD testing, and other important health care services.  The laws of the United States of America provide that not one penny can be given to Planned Parenthood for abortion services--not one penny under the law. Most people, if asked what percentage of the Planned Parenthood budget is actually spent on abortion services would get it wrong. The actual number is 3 percent. Ninety-seven percent of what Planned Parenthood does, in terms of family planning, cancer screening, STD screening, has no relation directly to abortion services, and that is compensated, but abortion services are not under the law. Congressman Mulvaney could care less. He would close down the sources of family planning in small towns and communities around  The concerns I have laid out today are just a few that I have about this nomination. The millions of hard-working Americans who believed President Trump's campaign promises, and as a champion for the most vulnerable, deserve far better than Congressman  There are real problems facing this Far too many people are struggling, and there is a lot of work to do. We cannot afford to risk our economic recovery, the retirement plans and savings of working Americans, the health of our children, the kind of care we want for our mothers and grandmothers--we cannot afford to risk them by appointing OMB Director Mick  I have no choice but to oppose Mick Mulvaney's nomination for Director of the Office of Management and  Mr.President, Mick Mulvaney is a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, which has made repeal of the Affordable Care Act--without a replacement--one of their main causes. This is not about good policy or the real consequences for people around the country. This is about ideology.  Mr.Mulvaney wants to rip health insurance away from nearly 30 million people and deny people the important consumer protections they have come to depend upon. He would once again allow insurers to impose pre-existing condition exclusions and discriminate based on gender and cut off coverage when someone gets sick and needs it most.  His answer to fixing our health care system is ``free-market competition'' and ``crackdown on frivolous lawsuits. Those might make good talking points, but they will not stabilize our insurance market and help people in need.  The Illinois Hospital Association estimates that Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in the loss of up to 95,000 jobs in Illinois--in hospitals, doctor's offices, construction, real estate, and beyond.  Over the last month, I have been going around my State, meeting with hospitals and providers, talking to them about what repeal would mean. They are worried.  You see, Illinois hospitals and health systems generate nearly $90 billion in the State and local economies each year, and 1 in 10 jobs in Illinois is in[[Page S1197]]health care. Hospitals are vitally important to our State's economy and vitally important to patients in need.  Don't just take my word for it, Franklin Hospital CEO, Jim Johnson told me:       In our community, at the time that the hospital in West      Frankfort closed, we [Franklin Hospital in Benton] managed to      stay open . . . they're just eaten up that they don't have a      hospital anymore. It's incredible what the loss of a hospital      can do to a small community. And I'm down there talking to      those guys every day because naturally I like them to use our      hospital . . . but those conversations, it has just torn this      community apart.  In Illinois and nationwide, rural hospitals would be particularly hurt by Mr.Mulvaney and Republicans' prescription for chaos.  In Illinois, 62 of our 102 counties are rural. We have 51 Critical Access Hospitals, which are the hubs of their communities. Rural hospitals typically are more reliant on Medicaid and Medicare, and have tighter operating margins.  So what has the ACA meant for them? In States that expanded Medicaid, like Illinois, rural hospitals have seen greater financial stability thanks to the decrease in uncompensated care--or charity care--costs.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate in rural communities has dropped by nearly 40 percent. This is not only great for those individuals obtaining insurance, it is also great for the rural hospitals who are now getting paid for the health services they provide.  Community Health & Emergency Services CEO Fred Bernstein told me:       You can look at Cairo as the ghost of the future. Because      there is not much left that we have to lose . . . We've lost      the only grocery store, and the only drug store in If      this Affordable Care Act thing isn't resolved and if we go to      block grant in the Medicaid program, there's not going to be      any resolution to those problems down there. We are not going      to be able to stay open. At least 72-74 percent of my      patients depend upon Medicaid . . . Without the expansions of      Medicaid that we've already seen, and without some of the      subsidies that those who can get some insurance will get to      keep that insurance, there's not going to be the ability to      afford any care for most of the people we serve.  Since 2009, the number of rural hospitals in Illinois operating in the red has decreased by 46 percent. Put another way, 16 rural hospitals in Illinois are now on much more solid financial footing thanks to the  I yield the floor.

933,topic-id,717,"Mr.President, this may be one of the most important votes in this new session of the Senate relative to the Trump administration. It is a Cabinet position most people are not aware of, except if you work here. It is the Director of the Office of Management and  This individual has the authority to write the President's budget, to establish priorities, and to review Federal spending governmentwide. It is a big job. It is an awesome responsibility. The way it is executed will not only lead to an accounting of our Federal expenditures, but it will have a direct impact on America's economy.  The choice of Congressman Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina for this job is wrong. It is wrong based on his record in the House of He was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus in the House of That is a group which led to the resignation of Speaker Boehner and continues to tie the House of Representatives into knots. Why? Because they have certain tactics they believe are credible tactics, which Congressman Mulvaney signed up for. Let me give one of them.  They think closing down the government is a good way to get people's attention. Well, they are right. It sure gets attention. But it does it at the expense of innocent people across America--taxpayers, those who are receiving critical programs, and Federal employees who are waiting for their paychecks. Congressman Mulvaney signed up for that.  Once every year or so we have to decide to lift what is called the debt ceiling, which is the indebtedness of the United States, the full faith and credit of our government--really, the credibility of our government when it comes to financing. Congressman Mulvaney, who wants to head the Office of Management and Budget, has said we can default on our national debt, and it really won't cause that great of a problem. That is just the beginning of some of his bizarre views.  He said he wants to end the Medicare program as we know it. He calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He has called for a 25-percent reduction in reimbursement for Medicaid; that is health insurance for children, the disabled, and the elderly in He also has questioned whether the United States as a government should continue to invest in medical research.  I am not making this up. This man who wants to set the priorities for the Trump administration and deliver the budget for America's future questions whether our Federal Government should invest in medical research.  When it came to paying for natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy--and it happens to every State--he decided that instead of coming to the rescue of people in an emergency, we would have to cut entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--as well as military spending, in order to pay for disasters. That is how shortsighted he has been, and President Trump has chosen him to write the budget for  I just have to say that his priorities as a founding member of the Freedom Caucus disqualify him for this job, in my consideration. The fact that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement and leave some 30 million insured Americans without the promise of healthcare security for their families is another indication of an extreme point of view which should not be defining our government in  I have no doubt Republicans are going to march in lockstep, with maybe one exception. Senator McCain has said he is going to vote against him. I think they will end up giving President Trump his man as head of the Office of Management and But we are in for a battle royal over the values in You can judge that values of a nation not by political speeches but by our budget.  Congressman Mulvaney will cut some of the most basic and fundamental programs of our government, would endanger our economy by questioning the full faith and credit of the[[Page S1227]]United States, and is prepared to shut down the government to get his way.

948,topic-id,1852,"Mr.President, I rise again to speak about the epidemic of gun violence in the city of Chicago and across  The American Medical Association has declared gun violence as a public health crisis in Every day, almost 300 men, women, and children are shot in this Gun violence touches every American community, but no community has suffered more than the city of  I am honored to represent that city. I love it, and I think it is a great city. I spend a lot of time there to get to know the people who were born there and live their lives there and call it home. It is a great honor to call it part of my State that I am honored to represent.  The stories that are coming out of the city of Chicago are heartbreaking stories--and none worse than this week. This week there was a slaughter of the innocents. In a 4-day period earlier this week, three beautiful children under the age of 12 were fatally shot.  On Saturday night, 11-year-old Takiya Holmes, sitting in her mom's car, was shot in the head and killed. A 19-year-old suspect in custody has been charged. He reported that he was shooting from across the street at rival gang members, and a stray bullet hit She died on Tuesday morning.  On Saturday, 12-year-old Kanari Gentry-Bowers was shot while playing basketball in the West Englewood neighborhood. She passed away just yesterday.  On Tuesday at 1:30 in the afternoon, 2-year-old Lavontay White was shot and killed while sitting in the car with his pregnant aunt and uncle. Lavontay's uncle was also killed. His aunt was wounded.  These shootings are senseless, devastating, and heartbreaking. Already this year there have been over 400 shootings in Chicago--so far this year. That is after there were more than 4,300 shootings last year.  My thoughts and prayers, of course, go to the victims and their families. I have attended so many marches and parades, funerals, and memorial services. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need to do something to reduce this epidemic of gun violence. There have been too many funerals, too many families who have lost that baby they loved, too many children who suffered the physical and mental trauma of gunshot wounds and witnessing violence. Many of these shootings could have been prevented, but it is going to take changes in our laws and changes in our attitude for that to happen.  We have absurd loopholes in our gun laws that make it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on guns. We have obvious gaps in our gun background check system. We have inadequate Federal laws to stop gun trafficking and straw purchases of guns. These factors allow a flood of illicit guns to come into Chicago from other towns and States, from gun shows in neighboring States where there is no background check. These drug gangs drive over to these locations and fill up the trunks of their cars with guns to take them and sell them in the neighborhoods to kids who shoot and kill one another day in and day out.  We have gun dealers--federally licensed gun dealers--who look the other way when someone comes in to make a straw purchase. That is the purchase of a gun that the purchaser is not going to use but is going to give it to somebody who is prohibited from buying a gun.  In light of the epidemic of gun violence in our country, Congress should be working around the clock to fix these gaps in our Federal law. But the Republican-controlled Senate is doing nothing to address gun violence in Chicago or anywhere else. Instead, look at what we just did yesterday. Just yesterday, this Senate, on this floor, voted to weaken the gun background check system instead of strengthening it. It is hard to understand how the Republican Party can have its priorities so wrong when it comes to gun violence.  We can respect Second Amendment rights of individuals. We can respect the rights of people to own a gun for self-defense, for sporting and hunting purposes. I have gone hunting. I have used a firearm. I complied with every law in the books, all of them. The hunters who were with me did too.  Why is it so hard to ask before we sell a gun to someone whether they have a criminal record, whether they are buying it for another person who might have a criminal record, or whether they have a history of mental instability, which would disqualify them from owning a gun?  We are facing a crisis in Chicago and across the Nation because of this violence. We in Congress have a responsibility to do everything we can at the Federal level to protect our constituents, our neighbors, from getting shot. We can't ignore this responsibility, and we certainly shouldn't be weakening gun laws as the Senate did yesterday.  We also need the Federal Government to be an engaged partner with cities like Chicago to help reduce violence and expand economic options in depressed neighborhoods. You can pick out three neighborhoods in the city of Chicago that account for almost 50 percent of gun violence--three neighborhoods. I visited some of them. They warned me: Don't get out of the car. They are right. Random gunfire is a reality of life in those neighborhoods. We know where they are. We know where the shooters live. We know where the victims are. We can do more.  President Trump sends out a lot of tweets. He likes to tweet about Chicago, and I am not quite sure why. Tweeting doesn't save lives. Saying that you are going to send in the Feds may be one of those short tweets that is catchy, but it doesn't mean a damned thing to the people who are being shot and are dying in the city of  Last week I joined my colleague Senator Tammy Duckworth, and we sent a letter to the President asking him to do more than tweet when it comes to  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.     President Donald Trump,     The White House,     Washington,       Dear President Trump: During the 2016 presidential campaign      and in numerous tweets and comments since the election, you      have lamented the recent surge of gun violence in Chicago and      said the federal government could help stop the violence.      While the level of shootings and homicides is clearly      unacceptable, tweeting alone will not fix it. Tweeting does      not break cycles of violence; tweeting does not help lift      people out of poverty; tweeting does not save lives. We urge      you instead to provide a surge in federal support and      resources for Chicago to reduce violence and expand economic      opportunities for neglected communities.       Public safety is primarily a local responsibility, but the      federal government must be an engaged partner in public      safety efforts alongside local officials, law enforcement,      and community stakeholders. There is much the federal      government can do to help.       Instead of tweeting, you could begin by directing your      Administration to enhance U.Department of Justice (DOJ)      programs that improve community policing, such as the COPS      Hiring Program to help local police departments put more cops      on the beat, and the Byrne-JAG grant program to enable local      law enforcement to purchase or upgrade equipment. We note      that in his first year in office, President Obama pushed for      a surge in COPS and Byrne-JAG funding through the Recovery      Act and the appropriations process that provided Chicago with      $13.256 million in COPS Hiring funding and $35.637 million in      Byrne-JAG finding. This is more than four times the amount of      COPS funding and 15 times the amount of Byrne-JAG funding      that the City received last year. You could push for a      similar funding surge.       We also urge you to direct DOJ to promote mentoring and job      training programs for youth and the formerly incarcerated. We      are ready to work with you to strengthen the Office of      Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to improve      mentoring and violence prevention initiatives and to boost      funding for recidivism reduction programs under the federal      Second Chance We urge you to direct DOJ to abide by its      commitment to help implement policing reforms[[Page S1239]]     recommended by the Department's Civil Rights We      also request your support for legislation to close gaps in      the FBI gun background check system and in federal firearm      laws that enable straw purchasers and gun traffickers to      flood Chicago's streets with illicit guns.       Federal efforts must also transcend law enforcement and      criminal justice programs to focus on causal factors,      including the lack of economic opportunity. We urge the U.     Department of Education and the U.Department of Labor to      prioritize important career and youth training programs that,      if properly funded and expanded, would address the role that      poverty plays in the violence epidemic facing Chicago and      other communities around the country.       Before you send your next tweet, you could request a surge      in additional federal resources for these public safety and      economic development efforts in But so far, your      Administration has refused to commit to spend any additional      resources to combat Chicago's violence and has actually      threatened to cut federal funds for the Now is not the      time for the federal government to abandon its support for      Chicago and its people.       This week, you reportedly attributed Chicago's crime      situation to the presence of undocumented immigrants. This      coincides with your January 25 executive order that makes up      to eight million immigrants priorities for deportation and      seeks to create a mass deportation force by tripling the      number of immigration agents. The vast majority of immigrants      in our country are peaceful and have strong family values,      and studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to      commit serious crimes than native-born individuals. We are      aware of no evidence that undocumented immigrants are      responsible for any significant proportion of the murders in      Chicago, and claims otherwise do nothing but distract from      efforts to meaningfully reduce the City's recent increase in      violence.       We note that you have urged Congress to fund the      construction of a wall on the Southern border that would      reportedly cost at least $21.6 billion, even though the wall      would not fix our broken immigration system and even though      Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district covers 800      miles of the border, has said ``building a wall is the most      expensive and least effective way to secure the border.'' If      your Administration were to take even one percent of this      funding and devote the resources instead to help Chicago's      public safety efforts, it would make a dramatic difference in      reducing Chicago's violence. We urge you to reprioritize      federal resources that you would request for wall      construction and commit those resources instead to reducing      gun violence in Chicago and other violence-prevention efforts      around the nation. Doing so could save many more lives than      tweeting.       Thank you for your consideration on this important issue.           Sincerely,     Richard Durbin,       U.    Tammy Duckworth,       U.

If that is the case, then we have a responsibility to your State to make it whole again. And whoever the EPA Administrator is should face that responsibility. I will join you in that effort.  But to go from there to say Scott Pruitt is the man to head the EPA because he is going to acknowledge this one fact, is to ignore his record, to ignore his position on the environment.  The Senator from Colorado, I know has to leave the floor, but I want to continue on this vein. Yesterday, the President of the United States decided to sign a resolution. He had a big gathering. He had Senator McConnell, the Republican leader and other Members of the Senate and the It was a big celebration. Representatives of mining companies, coal companies, even mine workers were there celebrating the repeal of an EPA rule. What was the repeal of that rule? The repeal of that rule related to what the mining companies could dump into rivers and streams from their mining operations. What was the fear? The debris in toxic waste that they would dump in the rivers would end up killing rivers, just like the river that the Senator from Colorado has given a speech on.  I might add that he voted to repeal that rule. So now we have the President of the United States saying we are going to revitalize the mining economy by eliminating a rule that restricts mining companies from dumping debris and toxic waste into rivers and streams. Now, that doesn't follow.  If you are dedicated to keeping our rivers and streams healthy and pure and reliable sources for safe drinking water, you don't do what President Trump did yesterday. You don't do what the Republicans in the Senate did just a few days ago and remove this rule. I struggled to understand.  I see my friend from Delaware is here. The Senator and I have been in this business for a long time together. I won't say how many years.  He knows, I know, and some others know, but most people would be surprised of the following: Which President of the United States created the Environmental Protection Agency? Richard Milhous Nixon, 1970. A Republican President created this Agency which has become the bete noire for the Republicans--the most hated Federal agency, created by a Republican  Why? Because at that moment in time, America was awakening to Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring'' and to so many other factors, when we finally concluded there was something we were doing to the environment that was harmful, not just to the environment but to the Earth, which we hoped to leave our children.  We joined together on a bipartisan basis--this is before I was in Congress--to create this Agency which Scott Pruitt seeks to lead. Now, what has happened? What has happened is there has been a role reversal here. The Republicans, who used to be part of environmental protection and safety, have now abandoned it.  In fact, that is the drum they beat on most often, when they talk about overregulation, the Environmental Protection Yesterday, this President--28 days into his Presidency--could not wait to sign a rule that allows mining companies to dump toxic waste and debris into rivers and streams. You know the argument: It is just too expensive not to. If we are going to make a profit, if we are going to employ people, then you have to let us dump this into the rivers and streams.  I don't buy it. The reason I don't buy it is that I can remember many years ago, the first time I went across my State of Illinois and took a look at abandoned mine lands. These were lands that were strip mined, which means they brought in bulldozers and really just found the coal deposits, not just that for below the surface of the land. They ripped out the coal and left the mess behind for future generations.  It was horrible--a horrible environmental disaster. They walked away from them after they made the money. They went out of business and left that mess behind for the next generation or the one beyond it.  I am all in favor of mining. Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with it at all. But responsible mining means that you are responsible when it comes to the environment. You just don't make your money and leave, you accept the responsibility to leave behind something that is as good as or better than the way you found it. It is known as stewardship. It is  This is kind of a moral responsibility which we accept on this Earth that we live on, to leave it better than we found it. The Environmental Protection Agency is there for that purpose.  I would say to the Senator from Delaware, they did a survey in Chicago a few years ago. They asked the people of Chicago: What is the one thing unique and defining about that city? Overwhelmingly, the response was Lake Michigan, as it should be--this magnificent great lake which borders the city of  It is a source of so much fun and joy and aesthetic beauty.

It took passengers and automobiles across that beautiful great lake. It moved them from Wisconsin to The name of the ship was the SS It had been around for decades. It was kind of an institution.  Come the summer months when people would cross that lake to head over to Michigan or back over to Wisconsin, they would pile on and bring on their automobiles and families. It was a great excursion. But we came to learn that there was another side to the story. The SS Badger was the last coal-fired auto ferry on the Great It burned coal to run the engine to move the ship across Lake  That, in and of itself, raises some interesting questions about pollution coming off the smokestack of the SS It turned out that wasn't the worst part. The worst part is that for decades, as the SS Badger trekked across Lake Michigan, it not only burned coal, it dumped the coal ash overboard while it was going across the lake.  This potentially dangerous and toxic coal ash was being dumped into Lake Michigan day after day after day. The Environmental Protection Agency came in and gave us the facts. It turned out that the auto ferry, that one ship, was the dirtiest ship on the Great It created more pollution, more damage to the Great Lakes and[[Page S1359]]its environment, than any other ship. Believe me, there are plenty of ships that traverse the Great This was the filthiest, dirtiest ship.  The EPA said to the SS Badger: We know you employ people. We know you perform an important function. But clean up your act. So what did the SS Badger do, in light of this EPA finding? Well, they fought them all the way. They came to Congress and asked that Congress designate the SS Badger as a historical monument. A historical monument? Well, it was an old ship. There is no doubt about it. But the notion that came from the Congressmen from Michigan and Wisconsin was, by designating it a historical monument, it would be exempt from environmental protection laws.  So the dirtiest ship--the SS Badger--on the Great Lakes would somehow have historical status and continue to pollute Lake I thought it was outrageous. A number of us joined in stopping that effort. Instead, we said to the EPA: You have given them years to clean it up. Now do something about it.  Next thing, surprisingly, the owner of the SS Badger asked to meet with me in my office. I said sure. He came in and he said: Senator, we employ 100 people. We have been doing this for years. We cannot technologically clean up the SS It just can't be done. We would lose too much money.  I said: I am sorry, but that is unacceptable. You cannot tell me that because of profitability you need to continue to create a bigger mess in the Great Lakes than any other ship on the Great  So he went back and lawyered up and decided he would fight the I stood with the EPA, the regional office out of We had a battle on our hands. A rule was issued by the  I hear so many Republicans come to the floor bemoaning rules and regulations. Let me join that chorus. Are there too many rules and regs in some areas? Are there some rules and regs which I could never explain or even try to defend?  But the rules and regulations of the EPA many times are critically important. In this case, that was exactly what we found. So the EPA issued a rule and regulation that said to the SS Badger: You have been given years to clean up, and you will not do it. So now the clock is ticking. There will come a moment when you will be subject to a substantial fine if you don't clean up your act.  Do you know what happened because of this onerous EPA regulation? Do you know what happened to the SS Badger, whose owner said that it was technologically impossible for them to clean up this mess? They came up with the most basic, simple solution. You wonder why they waited so long. They now hold the coal ash on the SS Badger as they go back and forth across Lake They remove it once they get to shore and put it into an environmentally acceptable waste disposal.  This was an obvious answer for decades, but they would not do it. It took the Environmental Protection Agency to step up and threaten it with a rule and a fine. Now they are finally doing it.  So I say to those who loathe government rules and regulations: This was a good one. For the health of the Great lakes, for God's gift to us of that beautiful body of water, we did the right thing and the EPA was there to do it.  Yesterday, when President Trump signed this new resolution that repealed the rule, he was reversing what I just described to you. He was saying to mining companies across the United States: Be my guest. Dump toxic waste and debris in our rivers and streams.  He did it in the name of job creation. We all want to create jobs, but if we are creating jobs at the expense of the health of rivers and lakes, if we are creating jobs at the expense of safe drinking water, that is a bargain I will not be part of.  Many times I have had a conversation with my wife and friends. I guess it reflects the fact that we have been on this Earth a little longer than some. You wonder out loud. You say: Why in the world do we have more autism today than we once had? Why do we have more cancers than we once had? People have a lot of theories. Some of them are wild and unfounded. But many times people say: Could it possibly be the chemicals in our drinking water? I do not know.  I am a liberal arts lawyer. Don't get me near a laboratory; I would not know what to do with it. But it is a legitimate question, whether there is some contamination in our drinking water, which has a public health impact. Someday we may discover that.  Isn't it best for us to err on the side of keeping our drinking water as safe and clean as possible? I think so. I don't want to turn on the tap and drink the water and think that I am making myself sicker or more susceptible to a disease. I sure as heck don't want to do it for my kids and grandkids. What Agency is responsible for that? It turns out to be the Environmental Protection That is the Agency that Scott Pruitt seeks to head.  He is a terrible choice. I am sorry to say that. I shook hands with him once. I don't know him very well. But when you look at what he has done--I think of a letter I received from Dale Bryson in I don't know him personally. He wrote to me and he said:       Having served under both Republican and Democratic      Presidents, we recognize each new administration's right to      pursue different policies or ask that Congress change the      laws that protect our environment. But EPA's administrator      must act in the public's interest and not simply advance the      agenda of any specific industry that EPA regulates.  Mr.Bryson goes on to say:       The agency is lucky to have had EPA administrators,      Republicans and Democrats, with the patience, skill and      commitment to public service that is needed to steer through      these challenges and deliver the clean and healthy      environment that Americans want at a price they are willing      to pay. We do not believe Scott Pruitt has demonstrated that      he has the qualities needed to lead the Environmental      Protection  He was not the only one who wrote to me. I have heard from constituents who believe that sensible environmental regulation is critical for us to have a clean planet to live on and leave to our kids. Tim Hoellein, a professor at Loyola University in Chicago, conducts research on water pollution in city environments. He wrote to me and said:       I note our city, State and county have made some major      advances toward better infrastructure and policy for clean      water. However, we are still not meeting our obligations to      our neighbors and future generations by rising to the best      standards of water stewardship.

1129,topic-id,1100,"Mr.President, yesterday the President of the United States had a long and eventful press conference--77 minutes--talking about the issues before us in this country and his administration. He referred to his administration as ``a fine tuned machine.'' That was his 28th day in office.  I will observe the following: This so-called fine-tuned machine was forced to dismiss the Acting Attorney General of the United States in the first 3 weeks. This fine-tuned machine was reprimanded by three different Federal courts for an Executive order on immigration and refugees which they found to be inconsistent with the law and the Constitution of the United This so-called fine-tuned machine had to accept the resignation in the first 24 days of the National Security Advisor to the President of the United Mr.Trump is making history. No President has been through those experiences. I wouldn't say it is a fine-tuned machine; I would say it is a history-making machine. And sadly this fine-tuned machine, as he calls it, has had some rough spots. That is not all.  This issue about the Russian connection in President Trump's campaign is not going away. Seventeen different intelligence agencies have verified the fact that Vladimir Putin and the Russians expressly tried to invade on a cyber basis the United States of America and to influence the outcome of an election. And it wasn't an equal opportunity effort--they were there to elect Donald Trump and defeat Hillary  To make the record perfectly clear, as they say, there is no evidence that the Russians had any actual impact on the actual casting or counting of votes, but they did everything else they could dream of. They tried to invade and hack sources of files and information and to disclose and release them in a timely fashion.  There was that horrible episode involving ``Entertainment Weekly,'' or whatever the name of that operation was, where they had a recording of then-candidate Donald Trump saying some awful things. It was no coincidence that 2 hours after that recording was released, they started releasing John Podesta's emails and files--the Russians did--to try to resurrect the Trump campaign that hit some pretty[[Page S1362]]rocky shoals. So we know that happened.  We also know there was contact with General Flynn, the National Security Advisor to Donald Trump, prior to the President being sworn in. The extent of the contact, we don't know. The number of people in the Trump campaign who may or may not have had contact with the Russians, we don't know, but we do know this: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has an investigation underway into this very question because it raises some big issues.  This is the first time we know in the history of the United States that a foreign power has tried to invade our electoral process. And it isn't just a benign invasion; this is one of our major enemies when it comes to national security, and the reason is obvious. Travel to the Baltics, travel to Poland, travel to Ukraine, and talk to them about Vladimir He isn't this great hero, as President Trump has characterized him, from their point of view; he is a threat to their existence. They know what happened when the Soviet Union had the power. It controlled the It controlled It controlled They don't want to see that day return. They want the United States and NATO to stand up and help make sure they have a way to continue their democracy and continue making their own sovereign decisions. Meanwhile, our President of the United States, Donald Trump, is tossing political bouquets and sweet little kisses to Vladimir Putin and his Russian regime. Is this worth looking into? You bet it is.  This week we made a leap of faith right here in the We have decided to give to the Intelligence Committee of the Senate the authority to move forward on this investigation. I reluctantly agreed to that approach. I am skeptical. I will tell you why I am skeptical. I served on the Intelligence It is a critically important committee, but the Intelligence Committee, 95 percent of the time, meets behind closed doors in a secret space without a sign on the door, and the proceedings of the Intelligence Committee necessarily are secret. This is not an issue that should be kept secret. We need to make sure the American public understands in an independent and transparent way exactly what happened when it came to the Russian involvement in America's election, who was involved in the Trump campaign, if anyone. We need names, and we need people to be held responsible.  The second thing is, the Intelligence Committee--if and when it finally issues a report, that report is going to be classified to some extent. We have seen pages, I am sure, of redacted materials, big black lines and maybe one or two words emerging from a single page. Who decides to take away the black lines and tell the American people exactly what they found? The ultimate decision on declassifying documents in the Intelligence Committee is made by the White  So here is the White House, President Trump and his people under investigation by the Intelligence Committee, and they have the last word about what the American people will see. Isn't it interesting--when it came to the investigation of Benghazi with Hillary Clinton, when it came to the investigation of emails with Hillary Clinton, the Republicans couldn't wait to have week after week and month after month of public hearings. Now they want a secret hearing in the Senate Intelligence Committee and no hearing in the House Intelligence It is a big ``shrug your shoulders; boys will be boys'' moment for the Republicans in control of the It shouldn't be for the American people. The American people have a right to know what the Russians did, and they have a right to know if and when members of the Trump campaign or his close associates were engaged and involved in what he has dismissed as a ruse. Seventeen intelligence agencies don't dismiss it.  We need an independent, transparent investigation of what happened. The American people have a right to know. And we ought to say to this President: You may conceal your income tax returns, unlike any other Presidential candidate in modern memory, but you cannot conceal from the American people the facts as to whether the Russians were attempting a cyber attack on the United States during the course of our last election. That is too critical a question to ignore.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,326,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February

This morning, Bob Michel, who served as the leader of the U.House of Representatives for the Republican Party, passed away at age 93.  His replacement as Republican leader in the House marked the end of an era of civility--Congress has never been the same--but his life as the son of an immigrant, as a decorated veteran of World War II, and as a person who was first a staffer, then elected to Congress, and rose to leadership is a testament to his talent and his commitment to  I had known Bob Michel for 35 years.

The codels in those days--the congressional delegation trips--were often bipartisan and had both Speaker O'Neill and the Republican leader, Bob Michel, hosting them as they went to important places in the world.  There was a time when Bob Michel was a Congressman and wanted to get home to Peoria every weekend but couldn't afford the airfare. Do you know what he did?

1212,topic-id,1336,"Mr.President, ``Hidden Figures'' has been lodged at the top of the box office charts for 2 months now--and with good reason. ``Hidden Figures'' tells the fascinating, true story of three mathematicians who worked as ``human computers'' at NASA in the early years of America's manned space program.  Their job involved double-checking the accuracy of intricate calculations made by NASA's computers. And they carried the weight of awesome responsibility. Fifty-five years ago this week, their calculations helped launch John Glenn into the heavens and return him safely after he had orbited the Earth three times.  Coming in the midst of cold war tensions and the real fear that the Soviet Union was winning the space race, that historic flight was a source of intense pride and relief to It made John Glenn a national hero and an international symbol of American ingenuity and ambition.  But the brains behind that flight remained largely unknown--until now. Why? It is because those formidable mathematicians--those ``human computers''--were three African-American women. They served this Nation at a time when racial segregation was the law of the land and gender-based discrimination was almost as common as air.  As America marks Black History Month, this month seems a good time to say thank you to Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Katherine  America's history is filled with the stories of men and women whose contributions have been minimized or overlooked entirely for the same reason the ``Hidden Figures'' of NASA remained unknown for so long--because our Nation's tortured history with race blinded us to large parts of our own national story.  Ninety years ago, an historian and scholar by the name of Carter Woodson suggested a way to overcome this historical myopia. Woodson and other prominent African Americans proposed that 1 week each February be designated Black History  This is the first Black History Month since the opening last fall of the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, This remarkable new museum represents America's first official attempt to tell the African-American story. In the not quite 5 months since the museum opened, more than 900,000 people have visited. My wife and I toured the museum over the Thanksgiving holiday. We spent hours there--what a moving experience.  The history of African Americans is a story that stretches back 600 years. It is a story of brutal subjugation, racial violence, and discrimination. It is also story of a resilient people who survived those horrors and created a rich and vibrant culture and who have enriched our Nation by their contributions in every walk of life.  In a speech a few months ago, then-First Lady Michelle Obama alluded to the vast and inspiring sweep of that history when she said, ``I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves and I watch my daughters--two beautiful, intelligent, black young women--playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.'' It was a simple but powerful image that captured how far we have come on questions of race since our founding.  As America's 44th President, Barack Obama grappled honestly with complex challenges facing America and the world and delivered solutions that has improved the lives of millions. He and Michelle served our Nation with uncommon dignity, wisdom, and compassion. I am proud to call them both friends.  The Obamas' story is just one of the stories told in the new African-American History Other famous African Americans are featured as well, from Crispus Attucks, the first patriot to give his life in the American Revolution; to the great abolitionists and women's suffrage champions, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman; from Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and singlehandedly shattered the racist myth of Aryan superiority; to the Tuskegee Airmen, who helped democracy defeat fascist tyranny in World War  The museum tells the stories of other prominent men and women, including Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King; Malcolm X; Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Justice of the U.Supreme Court; Congressman John Lewis, my friend, an icon of the civil rights movement; and Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman ever elected to Congress--in 1968. Some of the best advice I have ever heard about making a difference came from Shirley She said, ``If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.'' I think Shirley Chisholm would have loved to see the way the women of America are making their voices heard today and changing the debate in this country.  The new African-American History Museum and Black History Month give us a fuller, truer picture of our past. They also give us hope and guidance for today. Here are just a few quick examples of what I mean.  Ida Wells, born into slavery in 1862, was a journalist, activist, and feminist who led an antilynching crusade in the 1890s, speaking throughout the United States and She reminds us that brave journalists, armed with the First Amendment, can shine a light on wrongdoing and change history.  Garrett Morgan had only a sixth-grade education, but he also had a natural mechanical genius and an entrepreneurial bent. In 1914, he invented a ``safety hood'' that protected wearers from smoke, gases and other pollutants. It became the prototype in World War I for gas masks and for the breathing devices that firefighters wear today. His inventions have saved untold millions of lives.  While some argue that we should cut funding to public schools that serve low-income children, Garrett Morris reminds us that American genius and ingenuity isn't limited by race, or gender, or family income. Our future prosperity depends on our willingness to invest in the potential all of America's children.  Finally, Philip Randolph organized and led the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first predominantly African-American labor union. In 1941, he was part of a group that convinced President Roosevelt to ban discrimination in the defense industries during World War In 1948, that same group persuaded President Truman to issue an Executive order ending segregation in America's Armed And in 1963, Philip Randolph helped led the March on If you want to know how to raise the wages of working people and mobilize ordinary Americans to create a more perfect union, study the life of Philip  Black History Month actually started as Black History Week 90 years ago. The choice of the week had special significance; it included the birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and the mighty abolitionist, Frederick Douglass.[[Page S1393]]  President Lincoln once predicted that, if history remembered him for anything, it would be for issuing the Emancipation With that great promissory note of freedom, President Lincoln declared that the 3 million persons living in bondage in the rebellious states ``shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.''  The Emancipation Proclamation marked a turning point in America's Civil War; it transformed the fight to preserve the Union into something even larger and nobler: a battle for human freedom.  But without Frederick Douglass, the ``Great Agitator,'' there might never have been a ``Great Emancipator.'' Frederick Douglass was one of the best-known men in He was a powerful and respected speaker and journalist. He criticized Lincoln frequently and publicly for what he viewed as the President's timidity in denouncing slavery. But rather than denouncing Douglass, Abraham Lincoln sought his counsel, and their respectful relationship changed history.  Without Frederick Douglass's prodding, Lincoln might not have issued the Emancipation Lincoln might not have agreed to allow free men of color to serve in the U.Without Frederick Douglass, it might have been harder for Lincoln to see that the Civil War could not end until slavery had ended, that only ``a new birth of freedom'' could redeem the carnage of Civil  The relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass shows us the good that can be achieved when patriotic citizens dare to speak truth to power and leaders are secure enough to listen. That is a lesson worth pondering during this Black History Month and beyond.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1392-3.txt,326,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,16.0,February

1482,topic-id,314,"I thank my colleague from the State of Vermont and, for many years, my fellow colleague on the Senate Judiciary Committee for his statement. I couldn't agree with him more that we need an independent, transparent investigation of this Russian invasion into the body politic of America in an effort to subvert our sovereignty. It was made by a country that is not our friend and was made at a time when they were trying to influence the outcome of an election.  I just want to note to my colleague and friend from Vermont that during the break I visited Poland, Lithuania, and It was interesting. In Poland, they put up with the notion of Putin's interference on a daily basis. The most frightening prospect, of course, is the movement of military forces, which we hope never occurs, but they look at it as a very real threat. They have what they call the hybrid war. They said it isn't just the military; it is also his cyber attacks on our country, and it is also his propaganda on our country.  One of the Polish leaders asked me a question: We have been wondering, Senator, if the United States is not willing to confront Russia with its invasion of your sovereignty in your Presidential election, would you be willing to stand up for your NATO allies if there is an effort of aggression by Putin? Would you be willing to stand up against Russia in those times?  I think that is a legitimate issue. If we don't take what the Senator has raised very seriously about putting independence in the investigation of this matter, and we don't do it with dispatch, shame on us.

He does it in the tradition of Senator Bob Dole of Along with George McGovern, they were two of the most unlikely political allies. They really dedicated a large part of their public lives to fighting hunger.  I am happy to join him in the memory of Paul Simon, who did the same for the State of So I am looking forward to joining the Senator in this effort. I hope the Senator doesn't have to suffer another midlife crisis in the future. Let's continue this in a good bipartisan spirit.  I thank the Senator from  Mr.President, I have come to the floor repeatedly in recent months to raise concerns about the Russian cyber act of war against our Nation, about Russia's aggression elsewhere against the West, this President's disturbing alliance with Russia, and the majority party's incredible silence on the Senate floor on these matters.  Well, I just spent several days visiting our allies in Eastern Europe--notably Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine--and return even more concerned.  You see, regardless of the partisan leanings of who is in government in these nations, the concern is the same.  Is the United States, history's champion of democracy and collective security in Europe, backing away from these values and commitments just as Russia is more aggressively challenging them?  Is the American President really using phrases like ``enemy of the people'' to describe a free press--a term used by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, that was so ominous that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later demanded the Communist Party halt its use because it ``eliminated the possibility of any kind of ideological fight''?  Are the Trump administration's bizarre blinders to Vladimir Putin's aggression and true nature--and the silence of too many of my Republican colleagues on this danger--a harbinger of some kind of Western retreat to the Russians?[[Page S1438]]  Well, I met with many of our dedicated diplomatic and military personnel in the region who, as part of ramped up reassurance efforts by the previous administration, are working to keep Putin in check.  These included more than 100 U.military personnel working with their Lithuanian counterparts about an hour outside of the capital in These U.troops and their colleagues rotate out of Poland and throughout the Baltics to augment their NATO partners in deterring a Russian attack.  Mr.President, the concerns about Russian aggression are legitimate and warrant serious attention. Let's take a look at just recent Russian actions in One day after President Trump spoke to Putin on the phone in late January, Russian-backed separatists increased their fighting in Ukraine--1eading to the highest death toll in months.  After Vice President Pence tried to reassure allies at the Munich Security Conference the other week, Russia agreed to start accepting identification documents issued by the separatists in eastern Ukraine--one step closer to annexing the illegally seized territory.  Putin is strong-arming Belarussian President Lukashenko to allow Russian troops to remain based in Belarus following an upcoming significant military exercise. Russia is putting more and more sophisticated weapons into Kaliningrad, which when combined with permanent troops in Belarus, will significantly increase security threats to the region. Russia just announced a referendum to rename land it illegally seized by force in  Putin is trying to stir unrest in Kosovo where NATO is trying to maintain stability after the horrific violence of the Balkan war. He attempted a coup in And Russia continues its aggressive disinformation campaign and cyber attacks throughout Europe, trying to manipulate elections and sow instability and lack of trust in democratic institutions. One Polish expert summed all this up wisely, saying ``if the United States does not respond to the Russian attack on its election, Putin will feel he has a free hand to keep taking such destabilizing actions in the West.'' I worry that is what is already happening.  So, what is the response to these actions by this White House and the majority party--the party of Ronald Reagan who understood the Russians so well?  So far, with the exception of a few important voices, largely silence.  In fact, as I have mentioned here before, since October when the first intelligence reports came out about the Russian attack on our election, not a single Republican has come to the floor to discuss this act of cyber war by a former KGB official on our country.  And our President, who has attacked hundreds by Twitter for even the most benign perceived slight, has refused to say anything negative about  Obviously, we need to get to the bottom of the Russia attacks on our election and if anyone in the Trump campaign had inappropriate contact with the An independent commission led by respected individuals such as Sandra Day O'Connor or Colin Powell could lead such an effort. And we need to see the President's tax returns to clarify what his son said in 2008 regarding Trump's businesses seeing ``a lot of money pouring in from Russia.''  We need to pass the bipartisan Russian sanctions bills pending in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--one that tightens sanctions on Russia for its actions here and abroad and one that requires congressional approval before any sanctions on Russia are lifted.  And we need to make sure we include continued support to Ukraine and for the European Reassurance Initiative in our next appropriations bills.  Mr.President, I remember as a young Congressman trying to get into Lithuania more than 25 years ago when it courageously tried to hold an election breaking free from the Soviet  Those brave Lithuanians had little but their idealism and a few rifles to protect themselves from the Soviet tanks.  But in the end they prevailed, and one by one, Eastern European nations freed themselves from Communist tyranny, a struggle Ukraine is still fighting against  Today one can still visit the KGB museum in the capital of Lithuania--a hall of horrors that nobody should ever forget. One Lithuanian member of parliament I met, who remembers life not only under the Soviets but also under the Nazis, recalled how his mother had survived 4 years in a Nazi concentration camp.  He emotionally said that he had always seen the United States as the champion of freedom, democracy, and a Western global order. I could tell he was deeply worried about any backsliding on that important role and any possibility of returning to the darker days in  I don't know exactly what Steve Bannon is whispering in Trump's ear regarding his dark world view and indifference to the transatlantic Western alliance, but this post World War II partnership has served American and global interests. The relationship has brought stability to Europe after decades of horrific war. It has brought democracy and common markets and served as a check against the Soviet Union and now  I am glad Vice President Pence made some references to this at the Munich Security Conference, but those words will not be enough on their own. Quite simply, any sympathies in the White House with Russian efforts to undermine the transatlantic relationship are outrageous and dangerous, and I will oppose them here in the  To reiterate, Mr.President, during the Presidents Day break, I took a trip to three capitals, which I consider to be timely and important visits: Warsaw, Poland; Vilnius, Lithuania, and Kiev, I have been to these cities many times, and I have a particular attachment to them. My mother was born in Lithuania, and so returning there, as I have for over 35 years, I have seen a sweep of history as that small Baltic State has moved from a republic of the Soviet Union to a free and independent nation today. I am so proud of the courage of Lithuanians that had brought them to this moment.  Going to Warsaw, Poland, is natural for a Senator from We have more Polish Americans in that city and in our State than anyplace outside of We are very proud of our Polish heritage. They are wonderful people. They are not only hard-working, good Polish Americans, but they are also always thinking about their own homeland, which was under the control of the Warsaw Pact, a Soviet-inspired alliance, for decades, at the expense of their freedom.  I also visited Kiev, That capital has become well known to many of us since the invasion by Vladimir Putin, which is the point I would like to make.  The thing that ties these three countries together, despite their differences in history, is the fact that if you ask each of these countries today to identify the major external threat to their existence and to their freedom, they would identify Vladimir Putin of I found that in Warsaw, again in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, as well as in  It was interesting--and Senator Jeanne Shaheen joined me on my trip to visit Poland--that as we met with the leaders of that nation, we heard repeatedly their concerns about Russian aggression. It was something that was critically important to them. They were heartened by statements made by Vice President Pence at the Munich conference about the future of the NATO alliance, but let's put it in context. The reason the Vice President had to travel from Washington to Munich, Germany, to say to the Western world that was gathered there that the NATO alliance was still strong was because the current President of the United States, Donald Trump, had tweeted that NATO was obsolete, and one of his followers, Steve Bannon of Breitbart fame, had questioned whether we should be engaging in these kinds of alliances.  Well, I think those alliances are critical. The NATO alliance has been one of the most successful in history. So when Vice President Pence went to Munich to assure our NATO allies that we were still on their side, it was an important message.  I did find one other thing telling and memorable about that trip to One of the Polish leaders said to me: We have read that the Russians invaded your election. We are used to this. He called it the hybrid war. He[[Page S1439]]said: It isn't just aggression by Russians with military aggression, which is scary enough, but it is a war of cyber aggression and a war of propaganda, and clearly Vladimir Putin believed in your last Presidential election that he could use some of those same tactics that he uses against Poland and the Baltics in the United This leader in Poland then challenged me: What are you going to do about that? Now that you know that Vladimir Putin has invaded your election, now that your intelligence agencies tell you that, will you do something? Will you take this seriously? Will you investigate it? He said: Our worry in Poland is, if you will not respond to Vladimir Putin's invasion into your cyber space, what will you do if he invades Poland? Will you stand by us as you promised in article 5? If you don't take him seriously when he invades your sovereignty, will you take it seriously when he invades ours?  It is an important question and a right question. I hope we take a lesson from it--not to take Vladimir Putin for granted, not to view him as a superhero or great leader but to understand that people around the world are watching to see how we react to this Russian invasion of our election.  In Lithuania, they face propaganda on a daily basis. German troops under the flag of NATO are now in Lithuania making it clear that we are committed to the future and security of that nation. What did Vladimir Putin and the Russian propagandists do as soon as these German troops moved into Lithuania? They created an absolutely false rumor that a German soldier had raped a Lithuanian woman. It wasn't true, but it was the kind of false information that they have spread in the hopes of undermining the confidence of Lithuania and the NATO alliance.  I met with the President of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaite, and she is a very decisive leader. I thought of Margaret Thatcher's style when I met with President She is an ``Iron Lady'' in her own right to protect Lithuania and other Baltic States from Russian aggression.  The last trip we made was to Ukraine, and Congressman Mike Quigley of Chicago joined me in that visit. In that visit, we had a chance to meet late at night, 9 o'clock at night with the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, who was kindly waiting for us to get off the plane and come join him at his Presidential offices. They are struggling even to this day. As President Trump is in conversation with President Putin about future relationships, sadly, at that very same moment, aggression by the Russians in Ukraine was growing. Over 10,000 people have been injured or died now because of the Russian invasion of There is speculation, and I hope it is just that, that some backroom negotiations are underway to recognize this Russian aggression in I sincerely hope that never happens. We should never condone what Vladimir Putin has done to that country of They are struggling now to get back on their feet. They are making reforms that are unpopular but necessary. They are strengthening their economy and at the same time they are fighting a war.  I left there with two resolves. One was to make sure we provide military equipment necessary for Ukraine to be successful to ward off this Russian aggression; 2, to continue to work with them in terms of building their economy and reform; and, 3, that we have a visible physical presence with those NATO forces in the Baltic States and in We have a great alliance in these countries. In Poland the Illinois National Guard has been a longtime ally of the Polish forces, and we are very proud of that relationship.  When it came to Lithuania, we were able to see a group from Fort Carson in It was a tank command. I never saw prouder soldiers in my life--American soldiers anxious to show this Senator the Abrams M1 and the fighting vehicles they were using preparing for the possibility of defending Lithuania and the It was an inspiring moment.  I made my statement part of the record, and I know the Senator from South Dakota is seeking the floor, but I left there committed to the NATO alliance and committed to the effort to stop the aggression of Vladimir Putin, committed as well to come home to the United States and say to my colleagues in the Senate and House that we have to take it seriously when Vladimir Putin tries to change the outcome of an American election. It is a sad day in American history. I believe November 8, 2016, is a day that will live in cyber infamy for what Vladimir Putin tried to do in the United For us to ignore it, to sweep it under the table, to hide it behind some committee door, when no one knows what is going on inside, is not the appropriate answer. We need an independent, transparent investigation of what the Russians did, a special prosecutor at the executive level, and an independent commission like the 9/11 Commission, headed by notable Americans like GEN Colin Powell or Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who will bring all the facts to light so we know once and for all the truth of what happened and make certain it never happens again.

1706,topic-id,1086,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to address the nomination of Congressman Ryan Zinke to lead the Department of  As Secretary of Interior, Representative Zinke will be the steward of our Nation's precious public lands, national parks, tribal lands, and historical and cultural resources. These lands not only play an important role in preserving habitat, landscapes, and history, they also create jobs and invigorate nearby communities.  During his confirmation hearing, I was excited to hear Congressman Zinke refer to himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist.  We all know the important role Teddy Roosevelt played in protecting our natural resources. During his Presidency, Roosevelt established 230 million acres of public lands. In 1901, he created the U.Forest Service and established 150 national forests. In 1906, he signed into law the Antiquities Act, legislation that allowed either the President or Congress to set aside ``historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest'' in order to stop their destruction. With this act, he designated 18 national monuments, including several iconic areas.  A modern version of Teddy Roosevelt would be a wonderful selection to head the Department of But, after closely examining Representative Zinke's record, he doesn't appear to be a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist.  Last Congress, Representative Zinke voted in favor of an amendment to the House Interior appropriations bill that would have rolled back the authority of the President to use the Antiquities Act in seven Western He also supported a bill that would have effectively eliminated public review of hardrock mining activities on Federal lands. And he supported the Keystone XL pipeline.  Conservationist groups seem to have similar concerns about Congressman Zinke's record.  The League of Conservation Voters gave him a 3 percent rating for 2015 and a 5 percent rating for 2016--hardly what you would expect from a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist. This troubles me, as Representative Zinke, if confirmed, would be responsible for managing new monuments of great importance--namely, the Pullman National Monument and the Bears Ears National  The Pullman National Monument was designated by President Obama in 2015 in a Chicago neighborhood that has played a significant role in our country's African-American and labor history.  It represents the culmination of a collaborative effort by businesses, residents, and other organizations seeking to restore and preserve this unique community.  The Pullman neighborhood was originally developed a century ago by rail car magnate George Pullman as a factory town that would help shape our country as we know it today.  It was the birthplace of the Nation's first Black labor union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which is credited with helping to create the African-American middle class and making crucial civil rights advancements in this county.  Pullman workers also fought for fair labor conditions in the late 19th century. During the economic depression of the 1890s, the Pullman community was the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in the United States, which eventually led to the creation of Labor Day as a national holiday.  The Pullman National Monument not only highlights stories from communities that are rarely represented in other national parks, but its location on Chicago's South Side--easily accessible to millions of people by public transportation--also makes it particularly unique. Following its designation, the Pullman neighborhood joined the National Mall and the Statue of Liberty as one of the few DOI-managed lands in an urban area.  But Pullman now needs an Interior Secretary who is committed to dedicating resources that will ensure the monument is a driver of tourism and job creation in the community.  Public lands have certainly been a great economic driver in Utah, and the Bear Ears National Monument will no doubt build on this success.  The 1.35 million acre swath of land, declared a national monument by President Obama, covers forested mesas to redrock canyons and will protect the region's abundant cultural resources, which include well-preserved cliff dwellings, rock and art panels, artifacts, and Native American burials.  Bears Ears is special, as it is the first monument of its kind to be proposed and advocated for by a united coalition of five tribes, who sought its protection because of its important place in all of their respective cultures.  Congressman Zinke is well aware of the monument and has said his first priority as Secretary would be to go to Utah and make a recommendation regarding the status of the Bears Ears National  While this monument designation has been met with opposition from Utah politicians, the attacks on the Bears Ears Monument do not reflect the views of all  Recently, Utah's paper of record, the Salt Lake Tribune, called the political fervor a ``blindness.''[[Page S1467]]  ``That blindness can be sourced to Utah's one-party political system that has given us leaders who are out of touch with their constituents.'' It continues, ``The Bears Ears monument may be with us forever, and there is no bucket of gold waiting if it does go away. The presidential proclamation bent far toward the same boundaries and shared management [Utah Rob] Bishop pursued with his Public Lands Initiative.''  Sadly, attacks on monument designations are nothing new.  One of our greatest conservation Presidents, Teddy Roosevelt, faced a great deal of opposition to his designation of a national monument you may be familiar with, the Grand Most Americans can't imagine an America without the iconic Grand Canyon, a true national treasure.  But, at the time of its 1908 designation, groups were opposed to protecting this area. For years after its designation, oil and gas miners fought against additional protections for the Grand In the end, conservationists won out, and by 1919, the Grand Canyon was made into a national park to be protected for future generations.  Roosevelt said, ``It is also vandalism wantonly to destroy or to permit the destruction of what is beautiful in nature, whether it be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird. Here in the United States we turn our rivers and streams into sewers and dumping-grounds, we pollute the air, we destroy forests, and exterminate fishes, birds and mammals--not to speak of vulgarizing charming landscapes with hideous advertisements. But at last it looks as if our people were awakening''  Since Roosevelt's time, we have made a lot of progress in protecting our lands and waters, but still have a long way to go. That is why the next Interior Secretary needs to take a step forward in protecting more of our public lands, not backwards.

1712,topic-id,1672,"Mr.President, it has now been almost 5 months since our intelligence community first detailed how Russia launched a cyber act of war on America and our last Presidential election--5 months. In those 5 months, how many times have my Republican colleagues come to the floor of the Senate to discuss this national security threat, this cyber attack by Russia? How many times has the party of Ronald Reagan--who so clearly understood the threat of the Soviet Union--spoken on the Senate floor about this Russian cyber attack on America? That is right--zero. They have found more than 35 occasions to talk about stripping health care from millions of Americans, and they made time to urgently rush votes dismantling environmental and anticorruption regulation, but to talk about how a former KGB official launched a cyber act of war against America aimed at eroding trust in our historic democracy and electing the candidate seen as more sympathetic to Russia--zero. Not once.  Why would Russian dictator Vladimir Putin favor President Trump in the last election? Well, I just returned from a week visiting our allies in Eastern I can tell you, they are puzzled by this, too, and they are worried. They are worried that Donald Trump, the new President, is already advancing and will further advance policies sympathetic to Vladimir Putin's dangerous agenda, specifically weakening the Western transatlantic democratic alliance.  Regardless of the partisan leanings of who was in government in the nations[[Page S1468]]I just visited--populist, social democrat, conservative, liberal--the concerns in each of these nations of Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine were the same. Is the United States' history of championing democracy and collective security in Europe ending? Are we backing away from those values and commitments just as Russia is more aggressively challenging them? Is the American President really using phrases like ``enemy of the people'' to describe the free press in America?  You see, the countries that I visited were once in the Eastern bloc, Warsaw Pact, or Soviet They are familiar with that term, ``enemy of the people.'' That was a term used by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin that was so ominous that the Soviet Premier, Nikita Khrushchev, later demanded that the Communist Party stop using it because it eliminated the possibility of any kind of ideological fight.  Think of that. Here was Khrushchev saying: Stop using the Stalin term ``enemy of the people''; it is too divisive. Now it is being used to describe the media, a description that has been offered by the new President of the United Are the Trump administration's bizarre blinders to Vladimir Putin's aggression and true nature--and the silence of too many of his colleagues on this danger--a harbinger of some kind of Western retreat when it comes to Russian aggression?  It is hard to believe this is happening in 2017. President Trump has called NATO obsolete. That is a stark and completely wrong statement, so bad that it required the Vice President of the United States to travel to Munich, Germany, last week and reassure our allies who have been part of our alliance since World War II that NATO was not obsolete.  When has it happened in history that the President of the United States would make such a sweeping, erroneous, dangerous statement about the most important alliance in the world and then send his Vice President out on a repair job? The President has surrounded himself with people like Steve Bannon, who reportedly once called himself a Leninist and seems bizarrely sympathetic to Putin's dictatorial model and weakening the European alliance.  It turns out that the just-resigned National Security Advisor, LTG Michael Flynn, the one who was fired by the previous administration, the one who led chants unworthy of a great democracy about locking up Hillary Clinton, was, in fact, speaking to Russian officials before he or Donald Trump had taken office and, suspiciously, just after President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its attack on our election.  President Trump still refuses to release his tax returns to clarify what his son said in 2008 regarding Trump's businesses seeing ``a lot of money pouring in from Russia.'' President Trump even said yesterday: ``I haven't called Russia in 10 years.'' That is hard to verify. He spoke to Vladimir Putin on the telephone just a month ago, which was followed, incidentally, a day later by renewed fighting by the Russian-backed separatists in  President Trump visited Russia in 2013. He tweeted at the time: ``I just got back from Russia--learned lots & lots.''  Clearly, he did not learn enough about Vladimir As if that were not enough, this President still refuses to acknowledge Russia's attack or to criticize Vladimir You see, the President of the United States has trouble, a real habit of lashing out at everyone and anyone involved in a perceived slight, a dangerous and unbecoming behavior when granted the privilege to be President of this great  In fact, the vast number and range of those attacked or insulted via Twitter is so significant that I need considerably more time here on the floor of the Senate to list all of the targets of President Trump's attacks on So if you make any criticism or joke about President Trump, make any perceived slight, run a department store, lead a labor union, do just about anything, you may be a victim of one of his Twitter attacks, except, of course, if you happen to be a former Communist KGB official who now leads Russia, a nation that recently attacked our election.  How is it possible? How is it sensible? How is this not an abdication of the President's responsibilities? Russian President Putin launched a cyber attack and war on the United States and its democracy. November 8, 2016, is a day that will live in cyber infamy because of this Russian attack on the United States of  President Putin interfered in our election and tried to influence the selection of the American people in choosing their leader. The evidence is overwhelming. It has been available in increasing amounts for almost 5 months. The White House is silent, in denial.  Republican Senators are largely silent, and not one of them has come to the Senate floor to even address this issue. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin continues his aggressive military cyber disinformation campaign throughout  Just last week, the Washington Post reported that the White House led an effort to discredit news stories that described contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian Government officials. The House Intelligence Committee chairman, Congressman Nunes of California, a Republican, went so far as to dismiss these claims of Russian interference in the campaign for the President of the United States and to condemn the leaks that have brought this information to the attention of the American people. Rather than doing their part to ensure an impartial, independent investigation of these chilling facts, the White House has tried to spin it out of existence. In fact, yesterday, it was reported that the White House Press Secretary asked CIA Director Michael Pompeo and the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to help discredit news articles about the Trump campaign aides' contacts with Russian officials.  John Brennan, who was head of the Central Intelligence Agency under President Obama, was asked in an interview last night if he could imagine being contacted by the White House and asked to spin a story one way or the other. He said it was unthinkable. It just wasn't done under previous administrations. Here we are, not even 6 weeks into this Presidency, and it is already happening.  Can anyone here--anyone--imagine what would happen if the situation had been reversed? I can just imagine the howls of ``treason'' and ``impeachment.'' Not a single nominee would be confirmed until there were answers and accountability if this had happened and there was an effort by the Russians to influence an election in favor of the  What has happened to my friends on the other side of the aisle?

A Polish expert who I ran into during my journey summed all this up wisely when he said: If the United States does not respond to the Russian attack on its own election, Putin will feel he has a free hand to keep taking destabilizing actions in the  There was a time in Washington when national security issues were bipartisan.

We know that some 17 different intelligence agencies have told us unequivocally that Russia did everything in its power to try to change the outcome of this last election. We are told that there could have been up to 1,000 Russian trolls sitting in headquarters in Moscow, trying to hack into the computers of people in the United States to influence the outcome of this election.  We know that, coincidentally, some 2 hours after a very controversial, negative story came out against Donald Trump, the Russians released information that they had hacked from the campaign of Hillary  Two hours.

Leber Jeweler has been instrumental in not only serving as a model for responsible and ethical sourcing in the jewelry industry, but Brian and Joanne also have a deep history of activism and philanthropy, advocating for important policies that support human rights.  In 1999, Brian and Joanne developed and launched Earthwise Leber Jeweler was the first company in the United States to use conflict-free Canadian diamonds, and the landmark collection also utilizes fairly traded gemstones and recycled precious metals, all sourced, mined, designed, and produced with concerns for both the environment and fair-labor standards.  Brian and Joanne also have been notable advocates for laws related to the responsible sourcing of precious stones and metals, including of rubies and jadeite from Burma and gold and tungsten from the Democratic Republic of In 2007, Brian testified before Congress in support of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, and in 2009, he advocated for the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Kimberley Process for its human rights abuses in the Marange diamond fields. Then, in 2010, Brian supported efforts to pass bipartisan legislation that would create a mechanism to enhance transparency in the sourcing of conflict minerals and help American consumers and investors make informed decisions.  I have had the privilege of traveling to the Democratic Republic of Congo twice, in 2005 and 2010. It is a nation of breathtaking natural beauty, but like too many others, it has suffered from the paradox of the resource curse. Despite being rich in natural resources that should seemingly promote growth and development, the Democratic Republic of Congo has faced decades of weak governance, poverty, and incomprehensible violence. And fueling much of the violence, at least in part, has been the contest for control of these resources and their trading routes. Sadly, this violence had coined a dubious distinction for eastern Congo, known as the Rape Capital of the  I have seen firsthand the efforts of people like Jo Lusi and Denis Mukwege, who founded the HEAL Africa Hospital and the Panzi Hospital, respectively, restoring health and dignity to the survivors of sexual violence. When I chaired the first-ever hearing in the U.Senate about the uses of rape as a weapon of war in 2008, Mukwege stressed the importance of not just treating the consequences of sexual violence in the Congo, but addressing the root causes.[[Page S1474]]  Most people probably don't realize that the products we use and wear every day, from automobiles to our cell phones and even our wedding rings, may use one of these minerals and that there is a very real possibility it was mined using forced labor from an area of great violence. In 2009, I joined with then-Senators Brownback and Feingold--a Republican and a Democrat--along with then-Congressman Jim McDermott, to pass bipartisan legislation that would help stem the flow of proceeds from illegally mined minerals to those perpetuating such violence. For the first time, companies registered in the United States were required to report in U.Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures any usage in their products of a small list of key minerals from the Congo or neighboring countries. Companies also had to include information showing steps taken, if any, to ensure the minerals are legitimately mined and sourced and that, by responsibly sourcing these minerals, they are not contributing to the region's violence. It wasn't a ban, but a transparency measure aimed at giving consumers choice and fostering a cleaner supply chain.  It took time for the SEC to thoughtfully craft the rule for this simple and reasonable law, and disappointingly, as is increasingly too often the case with the rulemaking process, some tried to gut the law in court, but its core provisions have been repeatedly upheld.  A look since then at the filings submitted to the SEC indicates that some companies had already been leaders on this for years--Apple Inc., Intel Corporation, Motorola, Inc., KEMET Corporation, just to name a few. Leber Jeweler has been a trailblazer in its own right from the start as well.  It has been 7 years since passage, and we are seeing this law make a difference. According to the nongovernmental organization the Enough Project, an expert on the issue, more than 70 percent of the world's smelters and refiners for tin, tungsten, tantalum, or gold have now passed third-party conflict-free audits. In addition, the International Peace Information Service found that, as of 2016, more than three-quarters of tin, tantalum, and tungsten miners in eastern Congo are working in mines where no armed group involvement has been reported.  There is new concern today that the President may sign an Executive order suspending this simple reporting requirement; and yet many companies have come out in support of its continuation, including Brain and Joanne of Leber Jeweler  I am grateful to Brian and Joanne, for their support and advocacy on this important cause. They and others like them in the industry have been stalwart advocates for the responsible sourcing of minerals, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on ways to stem the horrific violence in the Democratic Republic of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgS1473-2.txt,326,COMMITMENT TO CIVILITY,2017.0,28.0,February

If someone doesn't believe in abortion, then make that choice for yourself. If someone believes in something else, then they have the right to make that choice. So eligibility for title X funding should be based on a provider's ability to provide family planning services, period. Whether a provider offers safe and legal abortions with private funds should not be used to prevent women and men from getting preventive care like cancer screenings or HIV tests. That is all the rule requires.  It should not be controversial. Yet, here we are.  What effect would this Congressional Review Act have?  Well, Kansas has given us an ominous preview. When Kansas defunded providers that offered abortion services, the number of Kansans accessing cancer screenings, STI tests, and other care through the title X program plummeted by thousands. A vote for this CRA is a vote to multiply that number.  The Americans who will be affected by this CRA will lose the opportunity to see the provider of their choice, sometimes the only viable provider.  Why would we want to put women--why would we want to put anybody in that category, where they cannot see the only viable provider because someone else doesn't like what the doctor can do?  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' My Republican friends always talk about individual freedom and how important it is.

That is what the American people want: a government that grapples with tough issues in a constructive way.  Unfortunately, since January 20, the new administration has shown no interest in working with the Congress on both sides to tackle problems, including Russia's unlawful interference in last year's election. That is why I decided not to stand on the aisle in the House Chamber to shake the President's hand during the joint session of Congress, as I have done in the past through Democratic and Republican administrations alike. This will be the first time during my 29 years in this House I have made this decision.

He has moved to gut the Affordable Care He has looked the other way when threats against the Jewish community have increased in the recent year.  This isn't part of our normal political discourse.

540,topic-id,1168,"Mr.President, I rise today as the Senate considers the nomination of Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be the Director of the White House Office of Management and That is We are long overdue in confirming Mr.Mulvaney to this key post because our Nation has so many pressing budgetary issues requiring the attention of this new administration. First among them is the staggering $20 trillion debt burden we are now faced with after 8 years of anemic economic policy and growth--and growing at the rate of half a trillion dollars a year. Confirming an OMB Director we can work with will put America on a more responsible fiscal path.  With their unprecedented attempts to delay the new Cabinet, Senate Democrats have ensured that the President has now been without an OMB Director longer than any other President in the past 40 years. That is how long the Budget Act has been in place. According to Senate records, from President Jimmy Carter to President Obama, the longest it has ever taken to approve a first budget director for a new President was 1 week--1 week. We are now in week 4, with little or no movement. As Majority Leader McConnell said last week, this is the slowest time for a new Cabinet to be up and running since President George Washington--and that was last week. It is even slower than that, and we are still not done.  It is vital that we fill this position as soon as possible because the Director of the Office of Management and Budget will help set the President's budget priorities and play an important role in working with Congress on setting the appropriate spending levels for the This position is crucial to helping the Federal Government function in what is shaping up to be a very challenging fiscal environment that requires all of our attention.  Some may wonder why Democrats are opposed to Mr.It could be because he has been a vigilant budget hawk during his 6 years in Congress, focused on the question of how we ultimately stop the Federal Government from overspending while continuing to fund the country's core priorities and responsibilities. They could be worried that the White House Budget Director will be a prominent voice, arguing for fiscal restraint, for responsible budgets, and for honest budgeting that avoids the use of gimmicks, such as emergency funding designations for nonemergencies.  I am hopeful Mr.Mulvaney and the OMB will ensure the taxes the hard-working Americans send to Washington are spent in the most efficient and effective way. The Federal Government has not been currently focused on making sure hard-working taxpayers get the best deal for their money. A new OMB Director focused on responsible budgeting can help ensure that when duplication in government programs and agencies is discovered, it is addressed. This will help make the Federal Government more accountable and effective.  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, every year outlines tens of billions of dollars in savings that can be achieved through various efficiency measures. OMB can play an important role in ensuring that spending programs do not duplicate each other while protecting hard-working taxpayers. Additionally, reforming and consolidating these programs can ensure that they focus on real needs and be managed with an eye on real results.  The Federal Government has grown so large and so complex that no one seems to know how many Federal programs exist. Even the executive branch can't tell us how many programs it administers. I have directed a lot of questions to the past administration, trying to find out exactly that. Of course, I would like to not only know how many programs they administer, I would like to know how many dollars are involved, I would like to know how many people it employs and how many customers they serve. There ought to be some kind of relationship there that means we are making a difference, but nobody is looking at it.  Several years ago, Congress even passed a law requiring the administration to publish a list of all Federal programs on a central governmentwide website, along with related budget and performance information--some of what I was just talking about. Unfortunately, when the program lists were put online, GAO reviewed the information and discovered that the inventory, in their words--listen to this carefully--was ``not a useful tool for decision making.'' What were they afraid of? But even if the government can't answer that question, we can find strong evidence that the number is on the rise, and Mr.Mulvaney will be able to play a crucial role in taming the unchecked growth of the Federal  I also look forward to working with him on the urgent need to reform the broken budget process, which has contributed to the budgetary stalemate and recurrent continuing resolutions to which Congress now routinely resorts in order to postpone hard decisions about spending and debt, which delays agencies from being able to plan.  There is an urgent need for important reforms to the process, such as implementing biennial budgeting so they can plan 2 years at a time, and the overhaul of outdated budget accounting concepts that have outlived their usefulness. Ultimately, my goal is to have Congress work with this new administration to produce comprehensive and lasting budget reform that can put our Nation on a better fiscal path. The Budget Committee has been working on that for a year in a very bipartisan way. It is time for us to put some of those into place.  Despite its significance, the preparation of the President's annual budget submission is only one of the responsibilities of As an entity within the Executive Office of the President, OMB has numerous governmentwide management responsibilities, in addition to budgeting and spending, that[[Page S1171]]concern various activities carried out by Federal agencies. These include agency rulemaking, agency contracting, agency grants management, agency financial management, information technology, program assessment, personnel policy, property management. We don't even have a list of what property we have, let alone when it is probably going to outlive its usefulness and when it needs to be replaced. That would be capital budgeting. I hope we can do that at some point.  It is for these reasons and more that I encourage the Senate to exercise its constitutional duties to provide their advice and consent on this key Cabinet-level position and confirm Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be Director of the Office of Management and  I have talked to him extensively. I have known him for a long time, and I know he will do a spectacular job with this at providing good advice to the President so we can do whatever we can do and bring as many people together in meeting the responsibilities of this government.

Then we got a little more sophisticated out West, and we said: You know, we need to give that person a fair trial and then hang him.  Sometimes I feel like these Cabinet position hearings are exactly that. They let the person ask questions. They ask very leading questions. I am not sure anybody listens to the answers. Then they have to answer a whole bunch of questions. I am not sure anybody reads the answers to those questions, and if they do, any time you read something, there can be a certain bias that is built into it. I am sorry that is happening to Cabinet after Cabinet after Cabinet position.  Traditionally, a President has gotten the Cabinet that he wanted, often in the first week that he was in. Some of them got it on the first day they were in.  This is a key position for the But we have to remember that he doesn't get to make any final decisions. He gets to recommend to the President and make a presentation to the President on what there ought to be, and then the President presents a budget.  Looking back over the last 8 years, we have voted on the President's budget. For 7 years, the President got zero votes. That means his budget did not go into place. In the eighth year, he got one vote. I am hoping that Representative Mulvaney can do a considerably better job than that in outlining what our needs are, presenting it to the President, and getting some agreement so that we can get this country on a plan to where we can quit increasing the $20 trillion debt burden which faces us because of the 8 years of anemic economic and policy growth we have had.  With unprecedented attempts to delay the new Cabinet, Senate Democrats have ensured the President has been without an OMB Director longer than any other President in the past 40 years. The reason I use 40 years is that is as long as that position has been in place.

I remember walking over to the inauguration next to the new Senator from Maryland, who talked to me about Mulvaney and said that he was kind of impressed that the two of them had agreed on some budgetary principles. That was a bit of a shock to me.  The Government Accountability Office every year outlines tens of billions of dollars in savings that can be achieved through various efficiency measures. OMB can play an important role in ensuring that spending programs don't duplicate each other. That is what Mulvaney is excited about. Additionally, reforming and consolidating these programs can ensure they focus on real needs and be managed with an eye toward real results.

747,topic-id,240,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.43 which is another baseless and dangerous attack on women's health care providers.  The title X Family Planning Rule, passed almost 50 years ago, already requires states to base title X funding on a provider's ability to provide title X services. This rule protects title X providers from facing unwarranted discrimination and allows them to continue doing the important work 4 million Americans rely on every year. Title X services include family planning services, cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and basic care. To diminish these services will result in women, men and young people with the greatest need being denied the opportunity to have any health care.  Whether or not a provider provides safe and legal abortions with private funds is irrelevant to their ability and capacity to provide title X services. In fact, it is preventive services and family planning offered through title X programs that help to lower the number of unintended pregnancies. But attacks on these providers and the services they offer in their communities persist.  This resolution rolls back protections that should already be guaranteed, but repeated attacks on family planning providers have resulted in the need for rules like the one this resolution dismantles.

I rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that this bipartisan bill that I have written, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, can be made in order for immediate floor debate and a vote.  The Presidential Tax Transparency Act would require the President and all future Presidents and Presidential nominees of the major parties, Democrats and Republicans, to publicly disclose their tax returns. It came as a surprise to many Americans, during the 2016 campaign, that this disclosure was not required by law. Instead, we have had a tradition of voluntary disclosure among every President of both parties since the post-Watergate era. Until now, our Presidents have recognized that those who seek or hold the most powerful office in the world should be held to the highest standard of transparency.  Donald Trump is the first President to refuse to release his tax returns since Gerald Ford, a man of the I remember when his remains were brought to the Capitol where he rested in the rotunda but came by the doors of the He was a man of the House and a man of integrity.                              {time}  1245  He along with a host of others, Democrats and Republicans, voluntarily released their tax returns. But Mr.Trump's 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission shows that he has 564 financial positions in companies located both in the United States and around the world, including relationships with state-affiliated businesses in several countries.  Why is this important to note? The President had an opportunity to resolve these potential conflicts of interest by divesting and placing his business assets into a true blind trust, as other Presidents have done, Republicans and Instead, he chose to turn over control of his business to his sons in an arrangement that the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics called ``wholly inadequate'' and ``meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.'' Since he is taken office, these ethics concerns have been borne out in the form of his and his campaign's connections to Russia, deeply, deeply troubling to all of us and to the American people, legitimately so; his family's potential new business dealings in the Dominican Republic and Uruguay; and the hiring of a ``director of diplomatic sales'' at his Washington, D.C., hotel to attract high-priced business among foreign diplomats. This is deeply unsettling, to say the least.  Simply put, the President's business empire makes him more susceptible to conflicts of interest than any other President in the history of our country. Three of the President's nominees have already withdrawn their names from consideration due to potential financial conflicts of interest. Only a full release of the President's tax returns will provide the public with clear information as to his potential conflicts of interest and his potential entanglements with foreign governments and foreign businesses.  Last night, here on the floor, the House voted along party lines, unfortunately, to block an effort to obtain the President's tax returns under the House's existing authority. Today, we have another chance to honor the will of the American people and write this important disclosure tradition into law--into law.  According to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 74 percent of Americans believe the President should release his tax returns--74 percent. The top petition on the White House website has over 1 million signatures to it, calling on the President to release his tax returns.  I think the voice of the people, the American people, is clear. As their representatives, they deserve to have us take action on this because we all want a conflict of interest-free  I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question so we can hold an immediate vote on the Presidential Tax Transparency  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1363-4.txt,355,P.M.,2017.0,28.0,February

If passed, H.67 will nullify a Department of Labor rule, just 1 month after it went into effect, that supports the efforts of large cities or counties, like New York City, in establishing retirement savings plans for their residents.  This rule is narrowly applied to jurisdictions that are populous enough to be their own State and whose States do not already have provided statewide payroll deduction saving plans. This is to ensure that the policy only goes into effect in cities where the people are in real need.  In New York City alone, 1.5 million private sector workers--almost 60 percent of the private sector workers throughout the city--do not have access to a retirement plan through their employer or business.                              {time}  1545  This rule gives New York City the ability to expand access for private sector workers to retirement savings plans. Rolling back this rule rips the opportunity to save for retirement out of the hands of millions of people.  Mr.Speaker, rushing to overturn this innovative rule without offering a single constructive alternative is irresponsible. This is just another example of Republicans attempting to hastily undo provisions that have helped people in real need without even providing a replacement plan to ensure working families have financial security after their retirement.  To make matters worse, using the Congressional Review Act to roll back this rule will prevent the Department of Labor from reissuing any substantially similar rule in the future. This is all on top of last year's Congress' abuse of the CRA in an attempt to nullify the fiduciary rule, which ensured that the advice workers receive is in their best interest.  This only further solidifies that House Republicans are not interested in helping workers. Instead, they are interested in deconstructing rules that protect our workers. House Republicans have failed to pass comprehensive and potentially bipartisan legislation to address our Nation's retirement security crisis and, instead, are pushing partisan legislation that is harmful to our Nation's workers.

529,topic-id,921,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to defeat a Congressional Review Act resolution that would weaken the FBI's gun background check system and make it easier for individuals with severe mental illness to buy guns.  Gun violence is an epidemic in our communities--killing more than 30,000 people each year; yet this resolution would prevent the. Federal Government from taking even the most basic steps to improve enforcement of current gun laws.  It blocks a rule that requires the Social Security Administration to report to the FBI background check system individuals who have a severe mental illness that prevents them from managing their own affairs. This determination is made during the application process for Social Security disability benefits.  This policy could have prevented tragedies like that of Janet Delana and[[Page S1168]]her daughter Colby was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 201l. She received Social Security disability payments as a result of her mental illness and lived with her parents in A year after her diagnosis, Colby used the money from her disability check to buy a gun at a local dealer. Her mom called the dealer and begged him not to make the sale. Janet explained that her daughter was mentally ill and suicidal and that she would likely use the gun to harm herself or others. Nonetheless, Colby passed her background check and bought the gun. Just an hour later, Colby shot her father to death and tried to kill herself. Janet's now a widow, and Colby lives in an institution. Their story didn't have to end that way. We should all agree that severely mentally ill individuals like Colby should not have access to guns. Federal law already says that individuals with severe mental illness are barred from purchasing or possessing guns. Yet time and again, we have seen prohibited purchasers like Colby pass background checks. That is because the background check system does not have records of all mentally ill individuals barred from buying guns.  While the background check system has denied gun transfers to 1.3 million prohibited individuals--including felons, drug addicts, and fugitives--it isn't perfect. There are individuals like Colby whose information should be in the system--but isn't. We need to improve the background check system and ensure information that is supposed to be in the system is in fact included.  A recent report by the Police Foundation and Major Cities Chiefs Association noted that this is critically important if we are going to reduce violent crime in our country. The 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech--the second deadliest mass shooting in our history--could have been prevented if we had a better background check system. Seung-Hui Cho, an angry, mentally disturbed individual, slaughtered 32 students and teachers and wounded many others. After the massacre, we learned that Cho in 2005 had been ordered to attend psychiatric treatment and a judge ruled that he presented ``an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness.'' As a consequence of this judge's determination, Cho's name should have been entered in the NICS database. But it wasn't--that is because the FBI didn't have the records.  In response to the shooting, Congress in 2007 unanimously approved the NICS Improvement Amendments Act to improve record keeping in the background check system. Senators Ted Kennedy, Pat Leahy, Chuck Schumer, and Tom Coburn worked together on the bill, and President Bush signed it into law. The bill was supported by both the National Rifle Association and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun That never happens.  It is this bill--passed unanimously and supported by the gun lobby--that required the Social Security Administration to issue the rule we are debating today. The Social Security Administration engaged in a painstaking process over the past year to develop this policy. It received more than 90,000 comments from advocates and members of the public. The rule was carefully crafted to identify individuals like Colby, while protecting due process.  The majority of individuals with mental illness do not commit acts of violence, and they would not be affected by this rule. The rule covers only individuals with serious conditions, including schizophrenia, who need additional assistance to manage their affairs. This determination is made following an extensive review of medical evidence, which takes place before the person is approved for Social Security disability benefits.  The rule further specifies that it would only apply to prospective claimants--starting in December 2017. That means it would not apply to individuals who already receive disability benefits. Repealing this rule through the Congressional Review Act would not only overturn the policy that's been developed. It would block the Social Security Administration from ever taking action to implement the NICS Improvement Act and report mentally ill individuals to the  Time and time again, my Republican colleagues respond to horrific mass shootings by saying that we don't need any new gun laws. We just need to better enforce the gun laws we already have. That is exactly what this rule aims to do--improve enforcement of current law and make sure people already barred from buying guns can't buy guns.  So, the question comes: What won't Republicans do to appease the gun lobby?  We lose more than 30,000 people to gun violence each year in this country, many of whom are mentally ill and commit suicide. It should shock the conscience of the American people the Senate is considering weakening our Federal background check system in response to this unabated epidemic of violence.  I urge my colleagues to vote against repealing the Social Security Administration's rule. Thank you.

1137,topic-id,983,"Madam President, I rise today to voice my concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the Environmental Protection  More than 74,000 Californians have contacted my office expressing serious concerns about Mr.Pruitt's nomination.  Californians want an EPA Administrator with a demonstrated commitment to protecting public health and the environment. Unfortunately, Mr.Pruitt's record shows the opposite: a clear hostility to public health and environmental protections at both the Federal and State level.  Californians rightfully fear that Mr.Pruitt's only plan for the EPA is to dismantle the Agency from within and give polluters free rein.  The EPA is the lead enforcement agency for bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Safe Drinking Water The EPA works with States, local communities and tribes to provide funding and expertise for fulfilling these environmental laws that keep our communities healthy and safe.  Based on his record as Attorney General of Oklahoma and his past statements, including in his confirmation hearing, Scott Pruitt is not the right man for this very important job.  As the Oklahoma Attorney General, Mr.Pruitt eliminated the State's environmental protection unit, which enforces State environmental laws, including suing polluters for criminal negligence.  Meanwhile, he's led or participated in over 14 partisan lawsuits against the EPA, challenging the Agency's ability to implement Federal environmental protections, lawsuits that challenged protections against mercury pollution, ``polluter pays'' clean-up requirements, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water  And his rhetoric matches his record. Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly questioned the validity of widely accepted science that undergirds EPA action. He routinely treats the scientific consensus on climate change as merely a debate. In an interview with Exploring Energy, Pruitt stated: ``There are scientists that agree, there are scientists that don't agree, to the extent of man's contribution and whether it is even harmful at this point.''[[Page S1370]]  He dismissed the dangers of mercury pollution, arguing in one of his lawsuits: ``The record does not support EPA's finding that mercury . . . poses public health hazards. . .''  At his confirmation hearing, when asked whether there is any level of lead exposure that is safe for children, he could only reply ``that is something that I have not reviewed nor know about.''  Even on his public profile, he described himself as ``a leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.''  We are supposed to trust someone to enforce our environmental laws who considers himself the primary foe of the EPA? That record is troubling enough, but Mr.Pruitt also faces many conflict of interest issues that he has refused to commit to recusing himself from as EPA Administrator, including: conflicts that would exist over ongoing lawsuits that he brought against the EPA as Oklahoma's Attorney General or matters or cases under the EPA's authority that involve organizations from which Pruitt has solicited campaign funding.  During his hearing, Mr.Pruitt deflected questions over potential conflicts of interest by stating the ``EPA ethics counsel will evaluate that if a matter or case comes up in the future.'' This is an inadequate protection against conflicts of interest.  The Environmental Protection Agency is very important to the health and well-being of the people of  For example, California received over $100 million in loans from the EPA last year to maintain and improve our water infrastructure, including wastewater treatment systems, drinking water systems, and water recycling facilities. Those funds were vital as our State grappled with an historic drought.  The EPA has also been a vital partner with California in developing stronger motor vehicle efficiency standards. One of my proudest accomplishments was enacting landmark fuel economy legislation, the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, which raised fuel economy standards to the maximum achievable rate. This law marked the largest increase in fuel efficiency in more than two decades and led to an administrative program expected to raise average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.  This program is the greatest tool we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, and it is working. An important technical review concluded this July that automakers are already exceeding Federal benchmarks for improved fuel economy by 1.4 miles per gallon.  A large part of its success is the cooperation between the Federal Government and California to establish a single, coordinated, national program that is strong enough to satisfy all parties and stable enough to guide investment decisions by the auto makers.  During his confirmation hearing, my colleague Senator Harris asked Mr.Pruitt directly if he would commit to upholding California's right to issue its own regulations, which is the way we participate in creating the national program. He declined, committing only to review the issue, which is not acceptable.  We in California know that climate change is real and is happening now. It is contributing to more volatile weather, including longer, stronger droughts and harsher bursts of rain.  We have a limited amount of time left to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of our transportation and energy systems. If we allow the world to warm by more than 2 degrees C, we will be locking in a future of unacceptable disasters for our children and grandchildren.  Now, more than ever, we need strong leadership as other major countries like China and India have begun to engage on the issue, and we cannot allow the EPA to reverse course and go backward after the progress we have made.  In his words and actions, Scott Pruitt has demonstrated more interest in fighting against the mission of the EPA than in fighting for it.  Mr.Pruitt has done little to nothing to protect the people of Oklahoma from the dangers and health problems caused by pollution, preferring to sue on behalf of corporate interests. There is nothing to suggest he would do anything different for the American people as EPA  For this reason and many more, I will vote against Scott Pruitt's confirmation to head the  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1332,UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,16.0,February

560,topic-id,776,"Mr.President, as I did last week and as I will continue to do until he is confirmed, I rise to support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream jurist. I look forward to helping make sure he receives an up-or-down vote here on the Senate floor.  After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and learning more about his judicial philosophy, I continue to be impressed by his humble respect for the law and by his commitment to service.  Before the Judiciary Committee begins our hearings, I want to highlight aspects of his jurisprudence that qualify him to serve on our Nation's highest Court and make him an ideal candidate to fill such a consequential position.  Earlier this month I spoke about his fitness to fill Justice Scalia's seat, as well as his respect for the separation of powers. Today I would like to focus on his approach to religious freedom.  I have always supported religious freedom as a universal principle. It doesn't matter if we are defending our own First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion here at home or standing up for the religious freedoms of people under repressive regimes abroad, our country has always valued the right of individuals to practice their faith as they please.  Just as religious freedom is part of our national character, it also provides insight into the character and judicial philosophy of a prospective justice. When I had the privilege of meeting with Judge Gorsuch last week, I asked him about his thoughts on religious freedom. I was struck by his ability to plainly articulate his understanding of the law and the He explained his religious liberty opinions by telling me that he simply went ``where the law led him.'' His explanation was indicative of his fundamental approach to interpreting the law. Judge Gorsuch doesn't make the law; he follows the law. He reads the Constitution as the Framers understood it. He interprets laws the way they were written.  Lately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been vocal about the importance of respecting our independent judiciary. I couldn't agree more. They have decried the perils of discriminating on the basis of religious belief. Well, they are in luck. The Supreme Court nominee before us would be a staunch defender of independent courts and religious freedom. All they have to do is help us confirm him.  I don't blame them for wanting to do their homework on a Supreme Court nominee. They should, as should we all. They will find that studying Judge Gorsuch's record will make for enjoyable reading.  On the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Gorsuch has authored a number of judicial opinions respecting the fundamental principles of religious liberty. His most notable was a concurring opinion in the Hobby Lobby case. In this landmark legal case interpreting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Judge Gorsuch ruled that the Federal Government cannot force individuals to assist in conduct that violates their deeply held religious convictions. I note that this law used to be noncontroversial. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was introduced by Senators Ted Kennedy and then Congressman Chuck It was passed almost unanimously in 1993 and signed into law by President Bill  In his concurrence, Judge Gorsuch wrote: ``The [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] doesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance.''  Religious tolerance--that is what our country stands for, and that is what Judge Gorsuch stands for. Judge Gorsuch's position was later vindicated by the Supreme The Court agreed that it is the government's job to protect an individual's ability to practice their religion, not to instruct them on how to practice their religion.  In closing, let me reiterate that I believe Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream jurist who will uphold the Constitution to ensure justice for all, regardless of an individual's religious beliefs or which administration is in power. As someone who embraces religious freedom, it is a privilege to support and confirm a judge like Neil Gorsuch, who respects this central constitutional principle. As I have said before, and I will say again, Judge Gorsuch deserves fair consideration by those who serve in this body, and he deserves an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. He should be confirmed overwhelmingly, and I am confident he will be.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

As a different public policy approach, I am considering a new idea called the zero-emissions energy credit, or                              {time}  1600  The more that we can do, I believe, to stop waste and pollution through conservation and innovation gives us peace of mind in regards to the proper use of our resources.  This ZEEC concept would reward reduced emissions through a tax credit[[Page H1284]]system. In this way, the government is not picking one technology over another or fighting over one regulation versus another, but positively valuing the diminishing externality cost of polluting emissions.  Mr.Speaker, environmental initiatives can also take many other forms. I am very proud to be recently named the co-chair of the International Conservation Caucus, called the It is one of the largest bipartisan caucuses in the  The ICC works to ensure the sustainability of both persons and wildlife, works to promote market innovation, as well as proper stewardship of our precious natural resources.  As an example, not long ago, in the African country of Mozambique, in the midst of a civil war, the Gorongosa National Park was completely stripped of wildlife and devoid of people. A once lush microecosystem is dead, primarily due to political disagreement.  Interestingly, fascinatingly, extraordinarily, a mere 10 years later, thanks to the work of a major philanthropist and a receptive government, a park system now teams with wildlife, with indigenous people reintegrated back into their homeland, who are engaged in now good and sustainable farming methodologies, engaged in park management, as well as conservation, all creating an atmosphere in which the entire ecosystem once again thrives.  Mr.Speaker, I don't know anyone in this body or anywhere else who wants dirty air or dirty water. However, as another example, if you live in Beijing, polluted air alone costs you 5\1/2\ years off your life. Parts of India are perhaps worse.  By the way, the Chinese Government was infuriated with the United States because we created at our embassy a pollution monitoring device, and then publicly released that data to Chinese society. It had a major effect. As one Chinese person once whispered to me: What is the point of all this economic development if it kills you?  Economic development without a soul strips us of the capacity to fully prosper. On the other hand, one of the prime contributors to environmental desecration is economic underdevelopment. Persons who have diminished economic options will use the resources at hand, sometimes merely to survive.  The tragedy of the commons occurs when there are fractured social linkages, a lack of access to technology and information to feed, clothe, and house in a more sustainable way.  Mr.Speaker, I believe this: as new technologies emerge, we may see exciting opportunities to build our own sustainably sourced microenergy economy, one that harmonizes with the environment and creates new economic opportunities and linkages.  This doesn't mean we all live on game preserves, but through proper public policy and innovation, we may be on the trail to environmental, economic, and community security, and perhaps create a new type of Great Plains Energy  Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congressman King, for the various aspects of leadership he has provided, particularly today, on an essential issue: a pro-life issue.

336,topic-id,281,"Mr.Speaker, in a time when so many Americans are looking for ideas and policies we can unite around, one point of agreement stands out. There is strong consensus among Americans that they do not want their taxpayer dollars being used to fund abortions. A Marist poll released in January revealed that 61 percent of Americans feel this way.  States have always had the freedom to direct funds away from abortion providers, such as the Nation's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, and there are many reasons States may wish to do so. The most important reason, one that we should all carefully consider, is that abortion is not health care. Abortion takes the lives of unborn children and hurts women. Many States have recognized this tragic reality and, as a result, have chosen to award funds to health clinics and organizations that do not provide abortions.  But in December, the Obama administration issued a regulation that forces many States to drastically alter their previous course of action. The regulation requires States to include abortion providers as recipients of title X grant distributions. Not only does this regulation ignore the American people's wish that their tax dollars be directed away from abortion providers, it also denies States the flexibility to choose to allocate title X funds in a way that meets the needs of their citizens.  H.43 disapproves of this unacceptable regulation, allowing States to return to the status quo under which they were operating prior to the rule's issuance. If States wish to disburse title X funds away from abortion providers, that wish should be respected. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule and H.43.

353,topic-id,511,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.66.  The Obama administration spent a lot of time and taxpayer dollars emphasizing the need to protect retirement savers, but as was often the case with the previous administration, their rhetoric rarely matched their actions.  For example, the Obama Department of Labor spent years advancing a flawed rule that will limit access to affordable retirement advice for low- and middle-income families. Despite repeated calls for a more responsible approach, the Department pushed forward with an extreme, partisan rule. Then, late last year, the Department finalized two additional rules that will also negatively impact the retirement security of workers. The administration crafted a regulatory loophole that allows States to establish government-run IRAs by circumventing protections workers and employers have enjoyed for decades.  As was usually the case, the actions of the previous administration hurt the very people it claimed to be helping. First, this loophole would lead to fewer protections for retirement savers. Working families will have less information about how their retirement plans are managed, and they will have fewer options if those plans are not managed well. They will also have less control over the money they worked so hard to put away.  We need to honor hardworking taxpayers, Mr.Speaker, who save for their retirement and not have the Federal Government do things to harm them.  The loophole also threatens to inflict significant harm on small business employees. It is already hard enough for many small businesses to provide their employees with retirement options, and this regulation only makes it less likely they will do so. In fact, many small businesses could actually be discouraged from offering 401(k)s or other private sector options. Others could cancel their retirement plans and dump their employees into government-run retirement plans.  Finally, the Obama administration's regulatory action puts taxpayers at risk. We already know that many government-run pension plans for public employees are woefully underfunded. Let me repeat that, Mr.We already know that many government-run pension plans for public employees are woefully underfunded. If government-run IRAs for private sector workers are mismanaged, does anyone seriously believe hardworking taxpayers won't be asked to foot the bill?  These may be unintended consequences, but they will be detrimental to workers, retirees, and small business all the same. Too many hardworking men and women struggle to plan for the future and retire with financial security and peace of mind. The resolution under consideration today will close a loophole that threatens that security and peace of mind.  To be clear, these resolutions will not prevent States and cities from providing workers and retirees with new, innovative retirement options. These resolutions will simply ensure that all workers and retirees enjoy the same protections that have been guaranteed for decades.  I want to thank Representatives Walberg and Rooney for leading this effort and working to protect the retirement security of hardworking men and women across the country. I urge my colleagues to support both resolutions.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1206.txt,1791,SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS,2017.0,15.0,February

986,topic-id,2340,"Mr.President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection The Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, is tasked with[[Page S1260]]protecting human health and the environment, including our precious air, land, and water. This is clearly one of the most critical missions in the Federal  Americans believe that a great country deserves safe drinking water, clean air, and to know that the products we use are safe. And Americans care about continuing this legacy for future generations, believing that we should leave the environment in good shape or better than we found it, and that is where the EPA comes in.  Before the Agency was created in 1970, a hodgepodge of inconsistent State and city regulations proved to be inadequate for protecting the right of Americans to have a clean, safe environment. Before the EPA, in some cities in this country, the air was so polluted that during the day, drivers could barely see the car in front of them. Studies indicate that the air in the 1950s in Los Angeles, as measured by particulate matter and ozone pollution, was worse than it is in Beijing today. Our rivers, including the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, caught fire. Schools were built on toxic chemical dumps. I know the thought of public health risks like these sound preposterous today, but this was all the case back before the It took parents and regular citizens standing up and demanding better to finally force action. In 1970, President Richard Nixon and a Democratic Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to create the  Let me be clear. The EPA is not perfect. There are many instances when I have stood up to the Agency because I felt its actions were not in the best interests of That said, since the creation of the Agency, the EPA has significantly improved our public health and our environment by cleaning up our air and cleaning up our water.  We still have a lot of work left to do. Yet we are now faced with a President and an EPA nominee who want to gut the Agency and reverse the progress we have made. President Trump has repeatedly attacked environmental protections and the He has called to ``get rid of'' the And during an interview with FOX News, Candidate Trump said of the EPA: ``What they do is a disgrace.'' And now he is in a position to try to implement his stated goal of gutting the EPA--gutting the EPA, that is right. He wants to slash critical public health and environmental safeguards, and to do this, he handpicked Mr. Mr.Pruitt intends to prevent the EPA from protecting public health and the environment by reducing the budget by two-thirds. Trump transition team member Myron Ebell made these plans clear. Mr.Pruitt will cut and then cut some more and then cut some more, until the Agency we trust to keep us safe is no bigger than it was when Richard Nixon was  So what exactly should we cut? Which aspect of public health and our environment is in need of less protection and research? Well, let me tell you about some of the things the EPA has accomplished since its creation.  The EPA helps protect us from toxins. From 1948 to 1988, 30 million homes were treated for termite infestation with two related, very longlasting chemicals: heptachlor and chlordane. These chemicals are among the 12 worst known persistent organic pollutants--a rogues' gallery called the dirty dozen. A long-term study found that millions of Americans have these chemicals in their blood and in their fat and that the higher the levels, the more likely a person is to suffer from dementia, type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, breast cancer, or lymphoma.  The problems arising from heptachlor and chlordane are still with us, but at least they are not getting worse. Why? Because hard work by EPA scientists helped expose the risks of these chemicals and led them to be banned in the United States in 1988. The world didn't catch up to the protection offered to the American people by our EPA until an international ban came into effect in 2001.  The Agency also determined that lead in our paint and lead in our gas caused terrible public health problems, and they got the lead out. In the 1970s, 88 percent of American children had elevated levels of lead in their blood. Now the number is less than 1 percent.  However, we know that the battle against old toxins is far from over, as the disastrous lead poisoning in Flint, MI, tragically reminds us. We also know that new risks appear every year. That is why Congress recently passed bipartisan legislation to allow the EPA to take action on the most concerning toxic chemicals, including asbestos. Slashing the EPA budget endangers future progress and will not make us better off, will not make us safer, will not make our children safer.  The EPA has also made our air cleaner. Thanks to the EPA, we have reduced air pollution--like smog and ozone and particulate matter--by more than 70 percent since 1970, thus preventing millions of asthma attacks, hospital visits, lost workdays, and more than 100,000 premature deaths every year. At the same time, the American economy has grown 240 percent.  The Agency was also instrumental in the phaseout of harmful substances responsible for depleting the ozone layer. The ozone layer shields us from harmful ultraviolet radiation that leads to sunburns or, worse, skin cancer. Thanks to the work of the EPA and other Federal agencies in cooperation with the international community, ozone depletion has now stopped and the layer has begun to regenerate.  The EPA has also made our water cleaner. The Agency invests billions in drinking and wastewater infrastructure every year through the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving These funds are particularly important to rural communities.  What is more, the EPA is actually saving consumers money. Take the fuel efficiency standards that require car companies to manufacture vehicles that go farther on a gallon of gas. These standards both reduce air pollution and save people money. Thanks in part to the EPA, from 1975 to 2013, the average fuel economy of a car sold in the United States more than doubled. Further increases in fuel economy standards under the Obama administration mean that if you buy a new car, you can expect to save an average of $7,300 on gas during the lifetime of that vehicle. As a whole, Americans will save $1.7 trillion at the pump.  This is just a small subset of what the EPA has accomplished over the years to protect public health and the environment. And I didn't even mention cleaning up toxic waste sites or testing foreign products for lead and mercury. But if Mr.Pruitt is confirmed to lead the EPA, all this progress and continued work is at risk.  As the attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt put the will of his corporate donors above the public interest time and time again, suing the Agency 18 times--suing the EPA 18 times--to block clean air and clean water protections. Now Mr.Pruitt wants to run the EPA, but he refuses to say that he will permanently recuse himself from those lawsuits that are still pending. Thus, he would be both the defendant and plaintiff in those cases. This is a bizarre world nomination. We cannot allow this type of conflict of interest at the  As attorney general, he failed to take environmental protections seriously. He dismantled the environmental protection unit within the AG's office, and in particular Mr.Pruitt's record shows a disdain for protecting the air we breathe. He filed three lawsuits to block EPA health standards for smog, soot, mercury, arsenic, lead, and other air pollutants. His actions directly threaten those who suffer from asthma and other lung conditions. We can't go back to the air we had in the 1970s. We can't afford the air Beijing has today.  Mr.Pruitt is so ideologically driven to protect the interests of oil, gas, and other polluters that he even gets in the way of clean energy projects that would create jobs. Take for example the Plains & Eastern Clean Line, a high-voltage transmission project that President Trump has identified as an infrastructure priority. It will bring clean wind power from the heartland to power-hungry cities. As Oklahoma attorney general, Mr.Pruitt did everything he could to kill that very same project.  Even more concerning to me is Mr.Pruitt's years of opposition to the renewable fuel standard, the This program is vital in our fight against dirty air, and it also greatly benefits Minnesota's rural economy. It is certainly better to drive our cars on[[Page S1261]]biofuels from the Midwest than on oil from the Middle I know that Mr.Pruitt pledged during his hearing to honor the RFS, but this same law provides him with an important loophole: The RFS permits the head of the EPA to reduce the congressionally mandated levels of biofuel production. I, for one, do not trust an avid opponent of the RFS to now be responsible for its implementation.  During the confirmation hearings, my Democratic colleagues pushed Mr.Pruitt on climate change. His answers were not reassuring. Unlike our new President, Mr.Pruitt did not call climate change a ``hoax.'' Instead, he was more subtle, repeatedly saying: ``The climate is changing, and human activity impacts are changing climate in some manner.'' Those words are intentionally deceptive. They are meant to sound reasonable but also to excuse inaction. If we look at Mr.Pruitt's record, it shows that he has been steadfastly against action on climate change, including a suit to block the first requirements for powerplants to reduce their carbon emissions. Let me remind you that these requirements are based on Supreme Court rulings from a conservative majority Court at that.  In a 2007 decision, Massachusetts v. the EPA, the Supreme Court found that the EPA had authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air It also directed the EPA to assess whether climate change endangers public health, which the Agency correctly determined it does. The Court further ruled that because of this hazard, the EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gases.  During his hearing, Mr.Pruitt made clear that all he wants to do is transfer more environmental protection duties to the States, but there are two major problems with that. First, 50 States each implementing different requirements is both inefficient and likely to lead to a race to the bottom. There are many States that will be tempted to trade away the long-term public health of their citizens for the quick financial rewards that will come if they are able to lure businesses from other States with the promise of lax environmental regulations.  All Americans deserve a clean environment. If States want to innovate, free them to do better than our national standards, but there needs to be an EPA that can make sure they don't do worse than our national standards.  While my State of Minnesota has been a leader in environmental protection, the second problem with the State-by-State approach is that pollution doesn't respect State boundaries. The people of my State should not suffer ill effects of pollution from States upwind.  Mr.Pruitt also implied during his hearing that the EPA's regulations are killing jobs, suggesting we must either choose employment and economic prosperity or public health and environmental protection, but this is a false choice. We know we can and must in fact have both. Addressing environmental challenges like climate change will not only help prevent unprecedented damage to our economy but will also spur economic growth and innovation.  My home State of Minnesota has shown how we can do this. In 2007, under a Republican Governor, we established a renewable energy standard that produced 25 percent of our power from renewable sources by 2025. We established an energy efficiency resource standard requiring utilities to become a little more efficient every year. We established an aggressive target to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050, and we are national leaders in biodiesel blending requirements. These policies have not led to economic ruin in They have led to economic development--rural economic development--as we harvest the wind and Sun and convert our biomass into energy. We are investing in clean energy technology not only because it cleans up the air but because it creates thousands of jobs. In fact, a clean energy economy now employs more than 50,000 people in Minnesota, and it will continue to grow.  In 2005, 6 percent of Minnesota's electricity came from renewable sources. Today it is almost 25 percent, and we continue to go higher. In addition to good jobs for Minnesotans, this transition brought a 17-percent decline in power sector greenhouse gas emissions during a decade when the population of Minnesota increased 7 percent. It is clear that an EPA led by Mr.Pruitt will not move us in the direction Minnesota is going.  Americans expect and deserve clean water, clean air, and a hospitable environment. Although EPA is far from perfect, the Agency has shown that a cleaner environment is compatible with economic growth. In fact, cleaning the environment helps drive economic growth. We cannot afford to entrust the EPA to Mr.Pruitt or anyone else who has a history of putting polluters' interests above the public's and above the economy as a whole. We cannot afford to entrust this Agency to someone the President has handpicked to slash its budget and to prevent it from carrying out its mission. Mr.Pruitt represents a step backward, not a step forward. He is maybe the last person who should be the next leader of the I will oppose this nomination, and I call on my colleagues to do the same.

145,topic-id,4191,"Mr.Speaker, I welcome Mr.Raskin and others who spoke before me as they consumed their Special Order hour in a very unique way, which is not often seen here on the floor, and that is a colloquy between our Republican freshmen and Democratic freshmen.  I want to take up issues that I know were covered by many of the freshmen as they discussed their hopes and dreams about what we might actually be able to accomplish in  Let me start with a photo. This is the largest waterfall in California, and I dare say the largest waterfall in the entire United It is not a natural waterfall. It is actually a manmade waterfall. With all of this turbulence and enormous churning of water below, it is a failure of a manmade spillway in This is the Oroville Dam that has been much in the news over the last several days.  As many probably know, California suffered through a 5-year drought. As a Representative of the great Sacramento Valley of California, my Sacramento Valley and my State of California suffered mightily. That drought tore apart communities, seriously injured the economy of California, and the health of many businesses.  So we went from famine to feast, and we are suffering serious indigestion as a result of the feast of water that we presently have.  Oroville Dam was built in the 1960s and completed in 1968. This is the spillway presumably capable of carrying well over 150,000 cubic feet of water. What you see here is the result of a failure right here in the concrete in that spillway, resulting in a massive hole in the spillway and this extraordinary churning and erosion over here on this side. This went on for some time.  The operators of the dam, the Department of Water Resources in California, said: Well, we are going to have to shut this down and take a look at the problem.  They did. And the problem was, while they were expelling 100,000-acre-feet of water, there was 200,000-acre-feet of water coming into Lake  I am going to take a few moments to explain this and then explain how California has successfully dealt with what could have been a serious tragedy.  Oroville Dam is the highest dam in California, some 770 feet high. The concrete spillway that I just showed you the picture of the largest waterfall in the Nation--not as high as Yosemite Falls, which is over 1,200 feet--is 700 feet down here to the river. It is 770 feet, actually. Right here is where the damage occurred. This is the emergency spillway, which was never to be used.  When this dam was built in the 1960s, they said: Well, we will build the regular spillway, but we will put this emergency spillway in here. This is a 30-foot-high concrete wall. Below it is the natural Earth and dirt of the Sierra Nevada mountains and foothills.  They shut down the spillway and 200,000 cubic feet of water comes into the reservoir. The reservoir rapidly rose to the point of where it was going over the top of the emergency spillway. Lo and behold, when you run 12,000, 15,000 cubic feet of water per second over the top of that spillway, you hit the dirt on this side and it drives down the river with incredible erosion.  This entire area was eroded. But most importantly, the erosion moved back towards the base of that 30-foot-high concrete wall, jeopardizing the integrity of that 30-foot-high barrier against millions upon millions of gallons of water stored in the reservoir.  All of this occurred on Sunday, 3 days ago. The call went out from the Department of Water Resources, Oh, my, we have a potential problem, as they observed the potential erosion against the foundation of that 30-foot-high wall. They said it is possible that that erosion could cause a catastrophic failure of the 30-foot-high wall, sending down into the river channel a 30-foot tsunami, the result of which would be a catastrophe downstream.  This might be a little hard to observe, but I am going to give it a try. Here is the dam right here. Adjacent to the dam is the town of Oroville, just downstream from the dam. Then, the Feather River continues down through my district, Marysville and Yuba This is all farm county up here with some significant towns like Gridley in this area, and Live Oak further down, which I represent. This area is represented by my colleague, Doug LaMalfa, who represents the northern San Joaquin  The reservoir is here. The spillway is here. There is a 30-foot wall of water cascading down the emergency spillway, hitting the river and spreading out 30 miles across the Sacramento Valley, all the way to the west side of the valley where the Sacramento River is. This red area is 100 feet deep in 1 hour. The city of Oroville faces a catastrophic event: 100 feet of water above the community within 1 hour of the breaking of that 30-foot wall on the emergency spillway.  It spreads out. Over here it is still 10 feet deep, 30 miles away. Of course, the water is going to flow down the river also. Two communities down here of 150,000 people, within 7 hours, would be facing water that would be 10 feet deep.  That is why they called for an emergency evacuation Sunday afternoon around 6 o'clock. Nearly 200,000 people left this area, all the way over to the west and all the way down some 30 miles down river, moving out to high ground up north to Chico, up into the Sierra foothills, and down towards  The water continued to spill over the emergency spillway. The Department of Water Resources, seeing the erosion, reopened the gates on the main spillway and sent 100,000 cubic feet of water down the spillway, creating an incredible but not lovely waterfall.  Fortunately, the water flowing into the reservoir very quickly diminished, from a couple hundred thousand acre-feet on Saturday and early Sunday to around 40,000 acre-feet toward Sunday evening and on into So the mathematics began to work in favor of the communities and in favor of the entire region.  Slowly, the level of the lake began to recede and eventually the water no longer flowed over the top of that emergency spillway. Nonetheless, you still had 30 feet of water behind that spillway and you had the integrity of the spillway in question.  They continued to reduce the water level in the lake and, marshalling resources up here, began to find a solution to the problem. When the sun came up Monday morning, the engineers went out and said: Oh, my.  There were four specific areas of serious erosion against the base and the foundation of that 30-foot wall with 30 feet of water still behind it. They decided to take emergency action to bring in by helicopter 100,000-pound bags of rock to stack in those four eroded areas.  Downstream, the communities of Marysville, Yuba City, Gridley, Live Oak, and other small communities were literally ghost towns. People were sheltering in various churches, fairgrounds to the north, fairgrounds to the west, east, and south. Nearly 200,000 people had moved out.  As this water receded and the emergency response began to take hold, people looked at this situation and said: Maybe this was the great would have, could have, and should have--would have, could have, should have.  Maybe when the dam was built, a concrete apron should have been built on the downside of that emergency spillway.  Maybe in 2005, when this entire project went back for re-licensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the call by the environmental community to concrete the down slope should have been taken into account and should have been done in 2006, 2007, but they decided it wasn't necessary or it was too expensive or whatever reasons, and so it was not done.  It will be done now. The cost of repair to the main spillway and to the emergency spillway will probably be over $200 million.  So the question arises for all of us: Do we want to wait until there is a disaster to take cautionary steps to put it back together, or do we want to get ahead of these potential disasters?  It is a question for all of us here. It is a question for the Congress and the[[Page H1169]]Senate and the It is called infrastructure.  You heard some of our colleagues earlier on from the freshman class talk about their desire for infrastructure improvements. Here is a prime example. Unfortunately, not the only example, but I want to share with you what actually is happening down river by the communities of Marysville and Sutter  There are 70 miles of river downstream from this point that has been in the process of significant levee improvement. Some $700 million has been spent over the last 5 to 6 years by the community, by the State of California, and by the Federal Government to bring the levee on the west side of the Feather River to a 200-year status. It is nearly completed, but not completely completed. There is another piece to be done even as this flood event takes place.  But a community stepped forward. It is called The Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency has undertaken that work--good for them--in the city of Marysville, which is a community surrounded on all sides by 20-, 30-foot-high levees. The Feather River and the Yuba River come together at that point at Marysville, a community that has seen catastrophic flooding in the past.                              {time}  1800  That community, too, together with the State of California and the Federal Government, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Yuba County Water Agency have been in the process of rebuilding and enhancing the levees around that community. These are positive examples.  Further down, the State of California has put together a flood control program for the entire Central Valley, from Shasta on the north all the way to the Tehachapi Mountains on the south, an extraordinary 600-, almost 700-mile stretch of the most fertile land in the world and major communities like Sacramento, with millions of people at risk of flooding. Different communities putting together their own flood control programs, reaching out to the Federal Government over the years, providing Federal assistance together with the State assistance to control the flooding that has been historic in  We need to continue this. We are not nearly finished yet in We are going to spend the $200 million here, and this will be concrete in the years ahead, and this main flood control system will be rebuilt.  But this problem is not just floods. We have seen the flood of Katrina in Mississippi where we discovered that, oh, my, the levees really could not handle a major hurricane. I will share a story of my own. When I was deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior, we were studying major storms, what would happen in a period of climate change, would we see stronger hurricanes. This was in the mid-1990s when I was there as number two in the Department of the We anticipated a major hurricane coming across from Cuba into the Gulf area and hitting New We were so concerned about this that Secretary Babbitt said: John, I want you to go down to New I want you to talk to the local officials down there.  I remember sitting in the editorial office of the newspaper, The Times-Picayune, sitting there telling them, showing them the map and saying: Here is what we believe could happen, and we, the Federal Government, together with the community, need to enhance your levees.  A decade or so later, I was sitting in I looked at the television set, and I said: Oh, my God, it is precisely what we predicted in the mid-1990s, and it came to pass. These are the lessons of history.  Here is another lesson of history. This is the Interstate 5 Bridge, the last bridge before you get from the United States to Interstate 5 goes from the Mexican border all the way through California, through Oregon, Washington, and then into Vancouver, British This is a bridge that collapsed.  How many other bridges have we seen collapse? We have seen the bridge collapse in Minnesota, and people died. We have seen rail bridges collapse. In California this last week, the main Union Pacific Railroad going north and south between Sacramento--well, all of northern California--way down to southern California over the Tehachapis, the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge just south of Sacramento collapsed. The rail cars, at least a day ago, were still sitting there in the water as they were busily trying to repair that rail bridge. A good third of all the bridges in the United States do not meet safety standards and are subject to collapse, and in some cases deadly collapse.  As we go through all of this, we need to be aware of the extraordinary need that our Nation has for infrastructure improvements. I think some of us remember the comments of our former Vice President Biden when he landed in LaGuardia, New York, and made a comment about that facility. I won't repeat it here because I am sure my New York friends might find that to be somewhat degrading. But it was a comment that was well deserved about the quality of that airport. The unfortunate part is that that is repeated in airport after airport around the United States: inadequate, old, not up to standards, and very poor in providing the efficient transportation that we require.  We can go on and on. We can talk about the highway system. The Department of Transportation estimates that we need over $836 billion just to maintain and bring up to standards the American highway system, both highways and bridges.  The public transportation system has a $90 billion backlog for public transit for the state of good repair. This isn't expansion. This is just to have good repair for what we need in our transit systems.  We can go on and on. Bridges, $20 billion. As I said, one in three of the bridges in the Nation--it is actually one in four--are structurally deficient and functionally obsolete. Sixty-five percent of our Nation's roads are in less than good condition. Our rail and bus transit systems face a $90 billion backlog, as I just said.  The 59 busiest ports in the United States only operate at 35 percent of capacity because the channels are filled with silt, and modern ships are unable to enter those ports.  The FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, has identified a need for $32 billion for improvement of our airports. It goes on and on and on.  America does not want to face this kind of devastation, with the failure of dams. I don't have the exact number of dams in the United States--I think there are some 83,000--but a good percentage of those dams are structurally deficient from many different ways. Obviously, Oroville Dam was one of them. It didn't have a sufficient spillway to handle the extraordinary flows of the river.  Another one central to California's water system is the San Luis Reservoir, a 2-million-acre-foot reservoir south of Sacramento, east of San Jose, that is central to the water supply of California, both for southern California, for the San Joaquin Valley, the farmers there, as well as for Los The Oroville Dam is the key dam for the California water system, which supplies water to Silicon Valley, to the San Joaquin Valley, as well as to Los  We have work to do all across this Nation, and we can do it. There is a lot of talk going on about the infrastructure program. Our new President has suggested a trillion dollar infrastructure program, somehow financed with private investment. Now, I don't know how that would work in repairing a dam such as Oroville or San I am not sure how a private investor would fit into that, but undoubtedly there are models in which there can be public-private partnerships. But that will not suffice.  There are programs that have been suggested by my colleague here in the House, by Mr.Mr.DeFazio has what he calls ``a penny for progress.'' It is a program that would provide nearly a trillion dollars of infrastructure investment for highways over a 10-year period. We would borrow the money, and then pay it off with a one-penny increase in the excise tax for gasoline and fuel as it would keep pace with inflation. A novel idea, one that probably would work if we could find the votes for it.  Over on the Senate side, the Senate minority leader, Mr.Schumer, has introduced a $1 trillion package of all[[Page H1170]]types of investment in infrastructure, and it is a project that deserves our attention. It is a project that would provide significant money for highways. In his proposal, he would create 15 million jobs over the next 10 years for investment in many different kinds of infrastructure.  He has something that I have talked about here on the floor now for 7 years. We call it Make It In America, Buy America, use our tax money to buy American-made products, bring our manufacturing back. If you are going to use rebar to rebuild that spillway, then use American steel. If you are going to put a pump in this dam to drain some facility, buy an American pump. After all, it is our taxpayers' money. It is my money. It is your money. Use the Buy America principle.  He has a couple of other principles that I think are very important. He wants protections for American workers, and this is both life and health and safety protections but also wage protection, the Davis-Bacon and the prevailing wage programs, all of which I think pull up the bottom with good working wages for men and women in the construction industry. Also, make sure that there is an opportunity for minority- and women-owned businesses, and of course the environmental protection. These are kind of the principles of his program, which I happen to think are appropriate.  So what would he spend the money on? He would suggest that we spend $210 billion repairing the roads and bridges. Now, remember, that is about one-quarter of what the Department of Transportation said is needed for the backlog, but, nonetheless, that is a good start. For roads and bridges, $210 billion over the 10-year period. That is 1.3 million new jobs.  He would also want to spend $110 billion for new water and sewer systems. Not bad when you talk about places like Flint, Michigan, and the contaminated water in their water supply. In our own Central Valley of California, we have numerous communities that have inadequate water and, in many cases, water that is contaminated with various chemicals, both natural and from the business environment.  Senator Schumer suggests that we spend $180 billion to expand and replace our rail and bus systems. That is more than just the transit programs. I suppose that is to make sure that the Union Pacific bridges don't collapse.  He would also have $200 billion for vital infrastructure projects. These would be the most critical, the high-priority projects across the I would suggest to the Senator, Mr.Speaker, that the Senator might consider rebuilding the spillways on the Oroville  He would also invest $75 billion on American schools so that our schools are new and modern and meet the needs of our students, another $70 billion on the ports. Remember, I was talking about this earlier, about the ports that are inadequate. This feeds back to what Mr.DeFazio has suggested, that we have the harbor maintenance fund. These are fees that are collected on every good that arrives or every container that arrives at our ports, and that money be spent on the ports, both in the water as well as on the dock.  That money, unfortunately, is not spent just there. It winds up in the Treasury for who knows what purpose. So we would bring that money back to spend on our ports, modernizing them. Keep in mind that Panama, the new Panama Canal, has been expanded, bigger ships, deeper draft, so we need to dredge these ports, we need to build the wharves, the docks that can handle them.  Senator Schumer would also recommend that $100 billion be spent in energy infrastructure to meet the needs of a modern energy system that is not dependent upon coal and oil but, rather, renewable sources of all kinds. And broadband, which is exceedingly important. In my district, which stretches 200 miles up the Sacramento Valley, broadband is not available. So these are infrastructure investments that I would think all of us should agree on, that we need to build a modern infrastructure for a modern economy and a growing economy, and along the way create as many as 13 million jobs to do that, a project that would go forward over the 10-year period ahead of us.  So we have got the President suggesting a trillion dollar program, public-private partnerships, of which I suspect there are some right there, we have got Mr.DeFazio with a financing program for highways and transit systems and ports, and we have Senator Schumer on the other side with a trillion dollar program that would deal with virtually every part of the infrastructure, from broadband communications to ports, highways, bridges, and the like.  So we have, I think, an opportunity here in this Congress to address a critical need for America's future, not only for the safety of Americans so that all Americans can avoid the kind of catastrophe that California came very, very close to having on Sunday, with the collapse of a 30-foot dam on Lake Oroville, creating not this, but something that would be several times bigger than this cascading down the river and inundating communities to the depth of 100 feet or more.  It doesn't have to happen. We should never be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We should never delay these infrastructure investments because we know that bridges will collapse, and along with it the transportation system.                              {time}  1815  We know that dams are in jeopardy. We know that our highways are filled with potholes. We know that many of our airports are ancient and, in many cases, decrepit and certainly not up to modern safety standards and certainly passenger convenience. We know that our ports need to be dredged and new wharfs and docks built. We know that we need to have intermodal systems so that we can efficiently move cargo from the ports to the trucks, to the trains, and across the country.  We know the needs. The question for all of us is: Are we ready to meet those needs?  I would suggest to you that we can. We can do creative financing, as Mr.DeFazio has suggested. There is a role for public-private partnerships in all of this, as the President has suggested. There is also a place in all of this for us to make choices about how we spend the taxpayers' money.  This is one that I want to bring to the attention of We are in the process of making a choice to spend $1 trillion over the next 20 years or so to rebuild our entire nuclear arsenal. All of it. All of our nuclear bombs, all of the ICBMs in the silos in the upper Midwest, new submarines with new intercontinental missiles with new bombs on top of those missiles, new stealth bombers such as the new B-21, new cruise missiles with new bombs. All of these things. New, fast, stealthy, unobservable, extraordinarily dangerous because the rules of the old Cold War or the old nuclear standoff don't apply.  One trillion dollars for what purpose?  We need to ask that question and we need to make choices. There are many other choices that we will be making here. Choices about building a $30 billion wall rather than repairing the bridges, in this case to Choices about nuclear weapons.  Our job--your representatives here in Congress--is to make choices that are wise, choices that protect you, choices that give all of us an opportunity to have good, well-paying jobs, a modern infrastructure on which the private sector can then grow and prosper, and men and women can earn a good middle class living.  Or we can make choices on things that really do not provide any of those benefits. It is about choices. It is about being prepared for tomorrow. It is about avoiding collapsed bridges and reservoirs that might fail and send a cascade of water down upon the communities.  So I ask my colleagues to consider, to ponder the needs of your communities, and to make choices that are wise, that look to the future, and build a solid foundation that won't fail when that 30 feet of water presses up against that foundation. I hope and I pray we make wise choices.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1167-2.txt,1973,SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME,2017.0,14.0,February

980,topic-id,2378,"Mr.President, there are few things that I enjoy more than bragging about my hometown. I live in a little town called Yuma, CO, out in the Eastern It is a town of about 3,500 people. If maybe you overexaggerate a little bit, it reaches 4,000. It is out in the middle of the High Plains of Colorado, 4,000 feet in elevation, 40 miles or so from the Kansas-Nebraska border. It is a farming community, 100 percent farming. Everything related to the town is farming. Even the clothing stores are related to farming because if you don't have a strong agriculture economy, nobody is buying blue jeans, nobody is going up to the car dealership to buy a pickup if the bushel of corn isn't priced right. So everything we do in that town is related to agriculture and farming.  My family comes from a background of farm equipment business and started a business--101 years old this year--by my great-grandfather. My time working in the dealership started roughly when I was in seventh, eighth grade. They let me do some very complicated tasks, high-skill tasks they let me perform: cleaning the bathroom, sweeping the floors. I did that throughout my time in eighth grade, high school, and college. If I go back today, I am sure they would let me do the same job, clean the bathrooms and sweep the floors. Part of that is because I was selling the wrong parts to a lot of farmers who would come into the dealership. Maybe they were just keeping me off the parts counter for the time being. In fact, maybe that is why people voted for me, to get me off the parts counter and quit selling the wrong parts.  Over my time working at the dealership, we witnessed a lot of good times in agriculture. I can remember one time going into my dad's and granddad's office and saying: You know what, the economy is really good. The price of corn is really high right now. We ought to order a whole bunch of farm equipment--a whole bunch of pieces of implements, tillage equipment, tractors, combines--and have them on the lot so we can take advantage of the good times in agriculture.  My granddad paused and looked at my dad and said: No, I don't think we should do that because I don't think times are going to be good next year.  They were right. This was back in probably the mid-1990s. They had seen it coming because of their experience in the business, the ebbs and flows of agriculture, the good times and the bad times. They were able to recognize, through their own experience, what different economic indicators meant to them and how they could forecast, using their experience, what was going to happen in the farm world the next year. So they decided not to order all that brandnew equipment. They decided not to order the tractors, the combines, and the tillage equipment. It was a good thing because the next year wasn't that great. If this 18-year-old, 19-year-old kid would have had his way, we would have had a whole lot of iron[[Page S1255]]we were paying interest on that year without being able to sell it.  Colorado is pretty blessed, with 4,000 companies involved in agriculture, 173,000 jobs in Colorado directly involved in agriculture. The State has more than 35,000 farms and 31 million acres used for farming and ranching. If we look at the Colorado business economic outlook, the net farm income of ranchers and farmers in 2016 is estimated this year to be the lowest it has been since 1986, and the projections for 2017 are even lower.  I grew up as a kid in the 1980s, watching perhaps the hardest times agriculture in the United States had faced in decades, watching a lot of people I knew my whole life going out of business, people having to sell the farm because of what was happening in the 1980s, leading to a banking crisis in agriculture in the 1980s, watching banks I had grown up with close.  I am concerned in this country that we are going to see the same thing again, beginning in 2016, into 2017, and then into 2018 next year. I am very worried that those tough times we saw in the 1980s, and some of the tough with the good times we saw in the 1990s, and some really good years a few years ago are going to seem like distant memories come later this summer and into next year if we don't do something.  I had the opportunity to visit with the Colorado commissioner of agriculture in my office last week, a gentleman by the name of Don Don Brown is from my hometown of Yuma, It has done pretty well for itself, 3,000 people. The State commissioner of agriculture is from my hometown. The previous commissioner of agriculture, a gentleman by the name of John Stoltz, was from my hometown of Both of them grew up in agriculture in that area, understanding what it is like on the High Plains, understanding what it is like to live through good times and bad times. Both of them today I think would tell you, they are very concerned as well about what happens over the next year, the next 2 years.  It wasn't that long ago when we saw some of the highest priced commodities this country has ever seen, at least in a very long time--the golden years of agriculture, some people said--where corn and wheat were priced high. People were able to pay their bills and buy new equipment. Commodity prices don't always stay that high though. The one thing a farmer will tell you is, the price of a piece of farm equipment stays high, the price of fertilizer seems to stay high. When prices come down on their commodities, the other prices--the inputs--stay high, and they find themselves in significant trouble.  The price of corn today is estimated to be about $3.15 per bushel. That is what it was in 2016, less than half of the 10-year high price of corn of $6.86 in 2012, just a few years ago. To put that in historical context, the price of corn in 2016 at $3.15 is lower than the price of corn in 1974, the year I was born, when it was $3.20. The price of corn in 2016 was 5 cents lower than it was the year I was born, 1974. It is the same story across the board for Wheat prices are down more than $1 from 2015 to 2016 alone and down more than 50 percent since 2012. I can guarantee, even though I may have sold a lot of wrong parts at the implement dealership, those wrong parts didn't come down in price 50 percent.  The livestock industry has seen similar trends, with cattle prices at their lowest level since 2010. In farming and agriculture, a lot of times we might see a year where the price of corn is high, but the price of cattle is low or the price of other commodities are high where the price of cattle is low, but when cattle are high, maybe other commodities are low. Farmers who have a diverse operation are able to offset the lows and the highs with a diverse operation--but not this year, and it looks like that may be the case next year.  Declines in States' agriculture economy are not unique to According to the U.Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, revenues have decreased for agriculture nationwide by more than 10 percent since 2014.  Recently, the Wall Street Journal wrote this, and I will show the headline of the Wall Street Journal piece just a couple of weeks ago. The Wall Street has an article entitled ``The Next American Farm Bust Is Upon Us.''  We have had a lot of debates on this floor. We have had debates about Cabinet members. We have had debates about resolutions of disapprovals. We are talking about a lot of things, but there is a lot of suffering beginning in the heartland of America right now. A lot of farmers and ranchers are suffering. They are worried about how they are going to survive, not just into the next year but how they are going to survive into the next couple of months. The telltale signs of difficult times are all around us in agriculture. This article, ``The Next American Farm Bust Is Upon Us,'' begins to tell the story. Here is what the Wall Street Journal said:       The Farm Belt is hurtling toward a milestone: Soon there      will be fewer than two million farms in America for the first      time since pioneers moved westward after the Louisiana            Across the heartland, a multiyear slump in prices for corn,      wheat and other farm commodities brought on by a glut of      grain world-wide is pushing many farmers further into debt.      Some are shutting down, raising concerns that the next few      years could bring the biggest wave of farm closures since the      1980s.  The article highlights the story of a fifth-generation farmer from Western I mentioned my hometown is 40 miles away from It looks very similar to the Eastern Plains of Colorado where I live. Here is his story:       From his father's porch, the 56-year-old can see the      windswept spot where his great-grandparents' sod house stood      in 1902 when they planted the first of the 1,200 acres on      which his family farms alfalfa, sorghum and wheat today. Even      after harvesting one of their best wheat crops ever last      year, thanks to plentiful rain and a mild winter, Mr.Scott      isn't sure how long they can afford to keep farming that      ground.  There is a lot of work we need to do to make sure Mr.Scott and farmers who live in my community around the Eastern and Western Slope of Colorado will be able to survive over the next year--steps so we can help to make sure we are addressing this crisis head-on, before it begins and develops into a full-blown farm crisis like we saw in the 1980s. We must have serious regulatory reform.  In a letter I received from the Colorado Farm Bureau, the letter read:       Colorado Farm Bureau recognizes that a major impediment to      the success of American agricultural industries and the      national economy is rampant federal regulation and the      associated cost of compliance.  We have to allow U.agriculture to flow to markets around the world, so in addition to that regulatory reform--some of which we are undertaking now through resolutions of disapproval by peeling back the overreach of government, we have to allow farmers access to more markets. That is a concern we all should share: What is going to happen with our trade policy in this country? Because if we decide to shut off trade in this country, if we decide to close access and avenues to new markets, the first people who are going to be hurt are those farmers and ranchers in Colorado and Kansas and throughout the Midwest of the United We have to have the opportunity to be able to send that bushel of wheat to Asia, that bushel of corn around the globe to make sure we are providing value-added opportunities for the world's best farmers and ranchers. Opening up new markets for Colorado and American agriculture is a clear way we can support rural economies.  Let's be clear. What I said at the beginning of these comments--there are farm communities that have diversity in their economic opportunities. A farm economy may not be 100 percent dependent on farms or ranches. Maybe they have tourism. Maybe they have some recreational opportunities. Maybe they are close to a big city where people can live there and commute. But there are a lot of towns across the United States that are solely, 100 percent committed to agriculture. They don't have access to anything but farming and ranching. When the price is down, the town is down. When the town is down, Main Street erodes. When Main Street erodes, it affects our schools and our hospitals and our relationships and our families. And somebody has to be looking out for our farmers and ranchers because the next American farm bust is upon us.  We have to take the necessary steps to pass a farm bill that gets our policies right when the new one expires. The current one expires in 2016, and these discussions are just now underway. If we have regulatory reform, if[[Page S1256]]we open up new trade opportunities for agriculture and we give farmers certainty--those are three things we can do to help address this crisis before it becomes a full-blown crisis.  We have to make sure that we support our farmers and ranchers, that we have their backs in good times and in bad times. Giving farmers certainty through a farm bill, through a regulatory landscape that provides certainty and relief, is important.  I talked to a family member of mine the other day who talks about his fear that he sees conditions similar to what we saw in the 1980s. The final relief we can provide is relief from financial regulations that are stifling the ability of banks to provide workout opportunities for farmers and ranchers when they need it.  Four things we ought to be doing for our farmers and ranchers: provide them certainty, regulatory relief, new trade opportunities, and targeted financial relief on regulations that are preventing workouts through our banks and our communities.  We have the opportunity now to prevent this country from seeing what it saw in the 1980s, but let's not be reactionary. Let's do what we can to get ahead of this before we start seeing what Secretary-designee Perdue told me the other day. One of the customers of his agricultural business took his life because he didn't know what was going to happen to his farm, and his three kids are now left wondering what they are going to do.  I hope this country understands how supportive we are of American agriculture and the actions we need to take to stand with them when times get tough.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1230.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,16.0,February
1120,topic-id,1548,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak on the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, whom I intend to support.  Over the past several weeks, we heard a number of Senators come to the floor hour after hour, 24-hour sessions through the night--1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock--in the morning and beyond, to complain about this nominee or that nominee, to express their concern about this nominee or that nominee. In fact, many times I think the only reason there is opposition to a nominee is that they disagree with a nominee because it wasn't Hillary Clinton who made the nomination.  We have heard countless people come to the floor today to talk about their opposition to the Trump administration I have a picture on the floor that shows the Obama This is a river in Colorado, enjoyed by thousands of people each and every summer. This is a picture of that same river under the Obama This was caused by 800,000 pounds of mineral and other waste going into the river because of a mishandled EPA project. This wasn't Scott This wasn't Donald This was the Obama EPA that did this. I only wish that my colleagues who have come to the floor for the past several hours had shown similar outrage when the Obama EPA did this to Colorado--inflicted this kind of damage on people in Southwestern Colorado in the Gold King[[Page S1357]]Mine spill. You want to talk about protecting States? Why didn't we stand up and protect this river?  On August 5, 2015, the EPA caused this spill. They admit they caused this spill, dumping 3 million gallons of toxic waste into Cement Creek and into the Animas Most Americans remember seeing this river. Most Americans remember seeing pictures of what this river looked like across newspapers, across television stations in August of 2015. When I visited South Korea, the President of South Korea asked me: How is the river in Colorado that the EPA dumped toxic sludge into?  In fact, I saw this picture on the news just a couple of days ago. Somebody was using it to complain about the Trump EPA administration. Somebody was using it to attack Scott This picture had nothing to do with Scott This was the EPA led by Gina My response to the spill was that the EPA should be held accountable to the same level at which the EPA holds private businesses accountable. I think that is a pretty good standard. But if the EPA is going to make sure that somebody lives up to a standard, then the EPA should live up to the same standard--that basic standard for the EPA, because the Agency caused this spill, and it simply must apply the same requirements to itself that it does to a private company.  So it was with great disappointment, but very little surprise, that, when the EPA decided to not subject itself to those same standards, they walked away from the promises they made. Sure, the EPA had standards under Barack They were double standards. The Obama administration EPA's refusal to not receive and process the personal injury or economic loss claims arising out of this spill of the Gold King Mine in Southwest Colorado is appalling. I simply wish the outrage was there when the EPA walked away from the people that it had injured in We haven't heard talk about it here.  We have heard a lot of complaints here, but nobody is saying they should be paying for the damage in Colorado they created. After all, we are discussing the EPA, which with the strike of a pen, and oftentimes with very little input from those people who would be affected, uses overly burdensome regulations and a heavyhanded enforcement to punish private businesses.  Despite the assurances and promises of the then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy that the Agency takes full responsibility of the Gold King Mine spill, the Agency in 2017--weeks ago--turned its back on the promises it made and denied paying claims for the harm they caused Promises were broken to our neighbors downstream in New Mexico and Utah, including the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and the Navajo  Administrator McCarthy called me last month, just before the news broke that the EPA would not be processing the claims of dozens of individuals and businesses in Southwest Colorado under the Federal Tort Claims Act against the Federal The spill occurred in August 2015. Over a year later, and in the waning days of the Obama administration, they turned their backs on their promises they made to Colorado and notified us in the waning hours of an administration saying: I am sorry. We are not going to help the individuals who are harmed. This refusal to compensate for the spill is unacceptable and wholly inconsistent with the EPA's commitment to take full responsibility with the States, local and tribal governments and communities.  This past election, voters said they wanted something different from the last 8 years in Washington because what they experienced was not working for the people--broken promise after broken promise. A year and a half ago, the EPA caused the Gold King Mine spill, and the past administration refused to make it right for The status quo at the EPA is not acceptable because broken promises are the status quo.  I have had earnest conversations with Mr.Pruitt over the past several weeks about my sincere disappointment about those broken promises, what we had to go through in Colorado, and what businesses had to go through in Colorado as a result of the EPA spill.  You can imagine that in an area that is reliant on tourism, what photographs of this in headlines across the country and in nightly news stories can do to a tourism-based economy. Those kayakers we saw in this chart had to shut the river down. Outfitters weren't allowed to be on the river. Dollars were lost because guides couldn't get out there. Booked trips that had already been paid for had been canceled. People didn't go because of the EPA's spill. The EPA's refusal to pay for lost property, lost economic opportunity, and lost business opportunity is simply unacceptable.  In the earnest conversations I have had with Scott Pruitt, he has promised to make it right. He has promised to stand up for the people in He has promised that he will make amends and pay for the damages that the Obama administration refused to pay for. He assured me that he is going to make it right, that he is going to work with the people the EPA injured and those who experienced economic losses and make sure that they are fully compensated. He agreed to come to Colorado shortly after his confirmation to make sure that the people of Colorado know that he will fulfill the promises that were failed under the Obama administration.  I would also like to talk about another top legislative priority of mine--passing Good Samaritan legislation. Good Samaritan legislation would allow Good Samaritans, like the mining industry, State agencies, local governments, nonprofits, and other groups the ability to clean up the environment and improve water quality conditions around abandoned mines. According to the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO, it is estimated that there are more than 160,000 abandoned hard-rock mines that exist across the United States, and at least 33,000 of these mines pose environmental or safety concerns.  One of the immediate actions we can do in Congress to address this toxic waste and improve our environment is to pass Good Samaritan legislation. It has been decades that this Congress has tried. It has been decades that this Congress has failed. It is time to start succeeding and time to start cleaning up the environment.  The last time the Environment and Public Works Committee was able to advance legislation on Good Samaritan was in 2006, from my predecessors, Senators Wayne Allard and Ken Unfortunately, since 2006, this concept has been unsuccessful and caught in partisan politics.  It is time to take steps forward for facilitating cleanup of the Nation's abandoned mines to prevent more spills like the Gold King  I have secured the commitment from Scott Pruitt to work with me on this legislation at the EPA to get this done, to work with both sides of the aisle to accomplish something, so that we can prevent this from happening. I am not going to stop working until our constituents are made whole from the EPA-caused spill at the Gold King I am not going to stop working until we pass--and we have to continue working to pass--the Good Samaritan legislation.  The 33,000 mines that pose a risk to the West is unacceptable. Our citizens, our pristine environment, our waterways, our children--this wasn't Scott This wasn't Donald This was an EPA under the previous administration, led by Gina McCarthy and President Obama, that walked away from the people of Colorado and the promises made. And it heartens me greatly to know, at least, that we have an administration that will move away from every promise abandoned to fulfilling the promises of protecting our environment.

103,topic-id,554,"Mr.Speaker, I am grateful to the chairman of our committee. I appreciate the question asked by my colleague across the aisle: Why now?  The answer to the question, why now, is that this Federal Government has not done its job. This Congress has not done its job in complying with the aspirations of the  When you have disagreement between documents, as we did between the Louisiana Purchase on the south border of the Red River, and Oklahoma going to the middle of the Red River--and, of course, the Red River changes as time goes on--then the Federal Government should have long since stepped in and said: Here is the land we are talking about. Here is where the borders will actually go.[[Page H1158]]  I am amazed at times, we talk in terms of agencies, of bureaus, of departments, as if they are some independent country that deserves a place at the United Nations making policies and making executive decisions all their own.  These people work for us. The Bureau of Land Management does have some folks that don't understand that. They think they are an entity unto themselves, and they make policy. Well, that is not what the Constitution set up.  In fact, the Constitution, in the preamble, as my friends know, says: ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic . . .''  This is what this bill is trying to do.  Now, last Congress, my friend, Mac Thornberry, had a bill that went ahead and took care of the issue, once and for all, and it was going to sell the land, and this dispute could be over. But since friends in the Senate were not able to come to a conclusion and they still just could not figure out what an appropriate disposition was, then my friend, Mr.Thornberry, has come back with this bill.  It is consistent with what every good parent will tell the child: Before you make a decision, gather all the evidence and information you can, then make a more educated, informed decision.  That is all this bill does, Mr.It says, we are going to do a survey now. We are going to figure out what land we are talking about.

We are going to worry about ``just us'' at the  We are not going to ensure domestic tranquility. We are going to create chaos, because when we create chaos, then we benefit.

Why now?  That is a great question. This should have been done 100 years ago or more than 100 years ago. It wasn't, so it is time to do it now and ensure domestic tranquility.

148,topic-id,3771,"Mr.Speaker, we had a resignation now that seems to be the big news of the day of a Cabinet member of the Trump administration.  It is interesting to have seen this Indivisible movement arise. The Daily Signal points out: `` . . . Ties to George Soros, Sows Division Against Trump, GOP Lawmakers.''  ``Democrats who used to work on Capitol Hill are helping to disrupt Republican lawmakers' town hall meetings across the country through a nationwide effort to oppose and `resist' President Donald Trump's agenda.''  And it goes on to talk about some of the leftists who are trying to do that.  And another article that says that the Indivisible team is trying to mimic strategies of the Tea But it was quite a difference. The Taxed Enough Already Party was grabbing hold of American principles, constitutional principles, principles that brought about the revolution and served the country well for over 200 years; and that we are supposed to have a government that works for us, not works us; takes away our religious freedom, tries to take away Second Amendment freedom, tries to take away freedom of religion; tells us we can't say anything negative about anything they care about or they will try to destroy us, our business. And there were people that were shocked. And then on top of it all, add a lot more tax. And as the President told Joe the Plumber, in essence: We need to take your income and spread it around the country.  I had some friends here during the inauguration. I took them to the Lincoln And, of course, on the south inside wall is the Gettysburg On the inside of the north wall is the second inaugural that is so profound. Mark Levin's father has a terrific book about it. What an amazing speech.  Lincoln is talking just shortly before his assassination. But the second inaugural, the war is winding down, it is about over, and there is so much hope abounding. He was not bitter. He was an amazing man, our first Republican He talked about the Nation and about how both the north and south both read the same Bible and both pray to the same He points out that the prayers of both could not be answered, the prayers of neither have been fully answered. But he points out that it might seem strange that a group of people would invoke God's name to wrench their bread out of the sweat of other people's brow.  But I heard enough from people in the Taxed Enough Already Party, this group that arose that--wait a minute--basically are saying when the President says, I am going to take your money that you made and spread it around, he is basically saying, Look, I am going to be the most powerful man in the world, and certainly in this country, and my principles dictate; I need to take what you work for and spread it around to other people.  Is that a way of wrenching your bread from the sweat of others?  It is interesting. But anyway, this group had 17 show up at an office. Obviously, they were more interested in publicity than a meeting, because all they had to do is call and we make sure they have a meeting and somebody is there to meet them, even though I am here in Washington when they demand to meet.  Apparently groups all over the country are following this Soros-funded effort to try to destroy the country, disrupt the country, and create anarchy and mayhem wherever they can. Fortunately, in east Texas, people realize we can't quite go as far as some groups do because nobody would accept it. I have got some constituents that are asking legitimate questions.  But what we go back to is what really gave strength to this movement, objecting to what was being done in the Obama administration, was when we had a President and a Speaker who were saying: We know that a majority of Americans don't want this ObamaCare, Affordable Care It is hard to call it affordable care because it is such a misnomer. But we see the polls. A majority of the American people don't want it, but we are going to stick you with it anyway because it is part of our agenda.  That is what was really bothering people. The thing is that this so-called Indivisible and groups like this are terrific at coming up with names that are anathema to what they really are. So you have a group called Indivisible, and their goal is completely dividing and destroying the constitutional principles of  But the thing is, a majority didn't want ObamaCare passed. It was shoved down their throats, even though most of the people in this body here had not even read it. I read it. It scared me. I am still asking for answers.  Why did President Obama need a commissioned and noncommissioned Presidential officer corps that he could call up. Initially, it sounded like a medical emergency group, but then it said they would be trained. It didn't say with weapons or with what. And it said the President would be able to call them up for any international emergency, and it didn't mention the word ``health'' or ``medical'' on that.  So, anyway, there is just so much in there that we didn't need. Most of Americans didn't want it and didn't like it. And it took away people's health insurance from them.  I was talking with thousands of people in my district. I love to do telephone townhalls with my district. This was one segment. About a third of the district last night was represented in this group, and I will have others coming up in the future. But it is very helpful to me because I can talk to people that you wouldn't see, you wouldn't hear, wouldn't see or hear you if you had 40 people come to a townhall, like sometimes do.  And since we know that there are groups out there that have instructions to create mayhem, disrupt, accuse them of racism--it is in the documents that we are seeing--whatever they bring up, charge racism, corruption, and something else, we can have a telephone townhall and I can find out what people are thinking that I otherwise wouldn't hear from.  I thought about doing a mailer to mail to as many in my district that I could, but the costs were just so dramatic. I could do it, but why spend $100,000-plus of taxpayer dollars just to find out what my district is thinking?  I think the best indication of what people in each congressional district in the country are thinking is what happened in the November election. That is the ultimate poll that anybody could ever take. And I have having been talking about for 6 years that ObamaCare needed to be repealed, that it takes away choice, that it is costing more money. You don't get to keep your doctor, you don't get to keep your insurance policy; and so many thousands in my district did not.                              {time}  1830  And so it was very helpful to hear from people, for example, how many believe the government needs to be more involved in health insurance, and I think that was at like 97 percent. There were thousands of people that had been called. But anyway, it gives me feedback.  It was interesting to note that this group, this indivisible group, the websites had gotten some information about the messages going back and forth, and one of them is, when we demand that they have a townhall that we can disrupt and they say we are going to have a telephone townhall because we can reach a lot more people, people that are invalids or homebound, seniors that couldn't get out to a personal townhall meeting can participate in the telephone townhall. They are saying how do we respond to that when there are so many more people they can reach and hear from and it helps the disabled to do these telephone townhalls, how do we respond to that? And they really didn't get a good answer, last I saw.  But it is important for every Representative to know where their district stands, where their people stand, and I continue to believe that I am the most fortunate Member of this 435-seat body because of whom I get to represent.  I had an opponent last year raising Cain about I was on national media so much, and I mean, when I think about it, why would national media want me to be on? It is certainly not my looks, certainly not because I have such an incredible voice.  You know, I would love to have a voice like James Earl Jones, or I was just so moved at the Senate Chaplain speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast a couple of weeks ago. I would love to have a voice like I think maybe God's voice may sound like[[Page H1172]]some day when I get to hear it, but I don't. I don't have a voice like that. This is what I have got. I don't put on any airs.  Why would any national media want to have me on? And I think it would have to have something to do with the fact that I represent extraordinary people in Texas where sense is very common, just so much common sense, and I think a lot of the country likes hearing about the way three-fourths of my district thinks. I think I reflect that district, and that is why, basically, three-fourths of the district voted for me. It is not because of the way I look or sound.  Even people that can't stand me in that 25 or 26 percent, they know I am going to stand up and do what I told people I am going to do. It is just that some people don't like it. Some years back, one guy wrote that I was a moron and misspelled ``moron.'' If he is listening, Mr.Speaker, he needs to know there is no E in moron.  But in any event, it is interesting to see how frantic things have gotten and how destructive some of the forces in this country have gotten in trying to bring down the principles that made us great, and it is quite disconcerting.  That leads me to a point I want to discuss, which we had the news, the tragic failing of the dam in We will continue, those of us who believe in the power of prayer, to pray that there will be no loss of life, despite the negligence of the California government in refusing for over 12 years--apparently, at least 12 years--to heed the warnings that this dam was going to be failing at some point. They needed to do something. We just need to pray that the negligence that occurred in the New Orleans area in diverting money away from shoring up the levee would not end up having the mass cost of loss of life in  But as we continue to have people try to disrupt our congressional districts, continue to try to make so much noise, create so much anarchy that it creates an inability to govern properly--despite the fact it isn't going to work--this President, this administration, and this Congress is not going to be diverted from what needs to be done.  This article came out today from the Free Beacon, by Adam Kredo: ``Former Obama Officials, Loyalists Waged Secret Campaign to Oust Flynn.''  Now, I hadn't known Flynn before. I don't believe I had met him before maybe last I might have, but I don't believe I have before that. But I had a chance to visit with him at that point with, at that time, Donald Trump, now our He is an interesting man. He has served his country well.  But there are issues that are coming out now about discussions with It would seem to me, if President Trump had an intelligence community and had people in the government service around him, the career people that were really wanting to help the country--rather than the Democrats or President Obama as he went out--that were really interested in helping the best interests of the United States of America, they would want the President to have all of the information that anyone in any of the upper echelons or anywhere in the departments that work for President Trump--wouldn't they want their boss to know or have the most accurate information?  Apparently, there was information out there that didn't come to light until President Trump had selected his National Security He had been sworn in as the National Security Adviser, and they were on a roll. And of course, one of the things General Flynn was concerned about, something that is a deep concern of so many of ours in this body, was the outrageous Iran treaty that got treated like it wasn't a treaty. It was, indeed, a treaty. It never got ratified by the Senate, but it was, indeed, a treaty. It had all of the things in it that treaties would have.  But this article goes on: ``The abrupt resignation Monday evening of White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is the culmination of a secret, months-long campaign by former Obama administration confidantes to handicap President Donald Trump's national security apparatus and preserve the nuclear deal with Iran, according to multiple sources both in and out of the White House who described to the Washington Free Beacon a behind-the-scenes effort by these officials to plant a series of damaging stories about Flynn in the national media.  ``The effort, said to include former Obama administration adviser Ben Rhodes--the architect of a separate White House effort to create what he described as a pro-Iran echo chamber--included a small task force of Obama loyalists who deluged media outlets with stories aimed at eroding Flynn's credibility, multiple sources revealed.  ``The operation primarily focused on discrediting Flynn, an opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, in order to handicap the Trump administration's efforts to disclose secret details of the nuclear deal with Iran that had been long hidden by the Obama administration.''  Mr.Speaker, I want to insert here, some of us went down to the classified area of the SCIF where we can review classified information and we reviewed what was available about the Iran deal, but we found out there was a lot of secret stuff that the administration would not allow us to know: what he had given away, what he had done, potential bad judgment in going so far out of the Obama administration's way to placate and assist the largest supporters of terrorism in the world.  Obviously, what this article is talking about, some secret parts of the agreement, those are things that we were certainly not allowed to read no matter who you were in Congress at the time.  But this says: ``Insiders familiar with the anti-Flynn campaign told the Free Beacon that these Obama loyalists plotted in the months before Trump's inauguration to establish a set of roadblocks before Trump's national security team, which includes several prominent opponents of diplomacy with The Free Beacon first reported on this effort in  ``Sources who spoke to the Free Beacon requested anonymity in order to speak freely about the situation and avoid interfering with the White House's official narrative about Flynn, which centers on his failure to adequately inform the president about a series of phone calls with Russian officials.  ``Flynn took credit for his missteps regarding these phone calls in a brief statement released late Monday evening. Trump administration officials subsequently stated that Flynn's efforts to mislead the president and vice president about his contacts with Russia could not be tolerated.  ``However, multiple sources closely involved in the situation pointed to a larger, more secretive campaign aimed at discrediting Flynn and undermining the Trump White  ``'It's undeniable that the campaign to discredit Flynn was well underway before Inauguration Day, with a very troublesome and politicized series of leaks designed to undermine him,' said one veteran national security adviser with close ties to the White House team. `This pattern reminds me of the lead up to the Iran deal, and probably features the same cast of characters.'''  And we know from news that has come out since the Iran deal was made by this administration, we know that some of the same placaters that enabled North Korea to develop nuclear weapons in the Clinton administration were involved in negotiating this deal with The deal with North Korea was to stop them from getting nuclear weapons, and so my interpretation of the deal was basically this:  They promised them: We will give you everything you need to develop nuclear weapons in North Korea if you will just sign a piece of paper that says you won't do that.  The Clinton administration, some of the same people that ran to do a deal with Iran, they jumped on that. And so what happens, North Korea uses what we provided them to help create nuclear weapons. Big shock.  So it is a big shock that the Obama administration would send at least one of those original people to be the top negotiator with Secretary of State John Kerry, who never saw a Genghis Khan that he couldn't work with, and they work out a deal. We still haven't found out all of the arrangements, all of the things that were done; but we know that there is, apparently, something so sinister about what this country has done, bent over backwards to provide for Iran or allow Iran to do, that the Obama administration could[[Page H1173]]not allow right-thinking American people to know what it had done for Iran and against Israel and the United States' best interests.  But if you believe the best interests of the United States are to weaken the United States, if you believe that the United States has been the biggest problem in the world for the last 100 years, then you would think, well, then if we make a deal with Iran that weakens the United States, may even lead to our demise, the world is a better place. So it is ultimately for the good of the world because the United States is certainly weaker than it has been in decades, going back to pre-World War II military strength.  The Chinese economy, it was announced at one point, may have exceeded ours. I am not sure that is true.                              {time}  1845  Anyway, countries around the world that are threats to world peace have gotten stronger. ISIS has gotten stronger during this President's term, in fact, came into being under President Obama and got quite strong, thousands upon thousands of lives lost.  In Afghanistan, he took a war that he told people--the voters in 2008--was the important war. And what should have been just a housekeeping operation under his leadership and with his rules of engagement, it cost about four times more American military lives than were lost in the height of the Afghan war for 7\1/2\ years under President It must be something in the leadership there when one President loses four times more military members than the prior President in the same length of time and the latter President being when the war was supposed to be basically over.  This article points out that:  ``Flynn had been preparing to publicize many of the details about the nuclear deal that had been intentionally hidden by the Obama administration as part of its effort to garner support for the deal, these sources said.  ``Flynn is now `gone before anybody can see what happened' with these secret agreements, said the second insider close to Flynn and the White  ``Sources in and out of the White House are concerned that the campaign against Flynn will be extended to other prominent figures in the Trump administration.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, I can inject here: Whoever these sources are that are concerned the campaign against Flynn be extended to other prominent figures, I can guarantee them that people in and outside the United States Government right now, as I speak, will do everything within their power--some of these characters will--to prevent President Trump from getting us back on track to making the world a safer place, to getting Iran back in the little box that President Carter let them out of. They are going to go after lots of people. It is not going to be limited. This apparently is a campaign that is going to be ongoing.  Apparently, General Flynn messed up and wasn't completely honest when he should have been. A President has got to be able to trust his security adviser. That kind of goes without saying. The President has to be able to trust those people.  It takes me back to September when I was talking--it was right before General Flynn walked up, actually ironically. But I was telling: Look, I like President George He is a good man. He is a smart guy. He is a lot smarter than people give him credit. He is one of the wittiest people you can ever have a conversation with, but something that hurt him--and I wanted Donald Trump to understand this--something that hurt him was that he was such a nice guy. After the election was over, he made it known, in essence, that everything that happened in the past is bygones. What is happening now, from now on, we are going forward.  The trouble is he had people doing bad acts, even crimes like having FBI files at the White Chuck Colson went to prison a year and a half for having one. The Clinton administration had nearly a thousand; nobody did a day.  I said, you have got to clean out these departments, these agencies where Bush didn't clean them out. You have got to or they are going to undermine you the whole time you are And it looks like we are seeing that right now.  So, Mr.Speaker, I just encourage all my colleagues to let's give the Trump administration the chance to help get this country safer, freer, and just a better place to live. It is not going to happen while people are undermining the President from within his own administration and a little cabal that has those ties in this administration. It is time to clean house, and General Flynn is not who I am talking about.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1170.txt,1801,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,14.0,February
454,topic-id,6101,"Mr.Speaker, in our Judiciary Committee today, we have been marking up what should have been a couple of rather simple bills, but it is really as if the instructions on the Soros-funded website, manual, things telling people how to obstruct the current majorities in the House and Senate and administration, could possibly be carrying over here into the Capitol itself because there are so many amendments being offered and things being drug out and people saying the same thing over and over. It is about Russia and corruption and one thing and the other--on and on and on.  It is just interesting when people are talking about their dramatic concerns over Russia, who, for years, have been totally silent. When everybody I know of on the Republican side here had been asking that President Obama and his administration do something about the terrible hacking problem from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, he didn't seem terribly bothered.  I mean, it was as if he were afraid he might hurt Putin's feelings or Khamenei's feelings in Iran and maybe they would want to kill Americans in a more brutal way, the Iran terrorists being paid. I can't help but think that there will be people in the next 4 years who are Americans, who are Muslim, Jews, Christians--especially those groups--who would be killed because of the billions and billions of dollars that this administration forced into the hands of the largest supporter of terrorism in the world:  It was as if the world--and in particular, the United States--had not been punished enough for the mistakes of the Carter administration in thinking that by pushing the Shah of Iran--not a great man. Apparently, he could be pretty brutal in his own right, but he kept radical Islam at bay.  When President Carter encouraged his forcing out of office, much as President Obama did the same thing with the President of Egypt, in both cases, it created a vacuum that was immediately filled by radical The Muslim Brotherhood is who filled it in In Iran, yes, it was radical And probably for the first time since the Ottoman Empire, radical Islamist leaders were given a country, a country's military with which to wreak their havoc on the world.  It is just hard to believe that, in the intervening years between President Carter leaving office in January 1981 and President Obama coming in in January of 2009, all history had been forgotten or possibly even not really learned.  I guess, if you are learning at the hands or at the feet of Jeremiah Wright, who has such contempt--GD America was his feelings and expression--or if you are at the feet of Bill Ayers, who felt that blowing up police stations, things like that, hadn't quite served the purpose, or perhaps if we take over educating college students who will one day train elementary students and high school students, then we can ultimately create the anarchy that we were trying to create in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Back then, we were unsuccessful, but great inroads have been made here recently. You would just have to believe that America was the problem for the world in the last 100 years, and apparently there are those who feel that way.  But for those of you who have talked with friends of different religions--Muslim, Christians, Jews, secularists--in different parts of the world, those who are actually fair minded make it very clear: the United States has been the greatest force for good as a nation that the world has ever known since the Dark It just has.  And thank God we have had such wonderful allies in the endeavors that we have undertaken. Of course, in the liberation of Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's hands, we had many other countries who joined us. President George H.Bush was going to liberate So many Democrats had screamed at President George H.Bush as troops were moving into Iraq after the liberation of Kuwait, screaming: Stop, stop, stop. They are giving up. They are giving up.  President George H.Bush ordered the stoppage, and immediately thereafter, the Democrats that screamed for him to stop began berating Bush because he didn't finish the job in Some of those same people were around to condemn his son George Bush when he actually did finish the job.  There was yellowcake uranium that was taken out which showed that Joseph Wilson had apparently said one thing to CIA agents and testified to something totally different, who said something totally different from his original interview when he got back from Of course, he was heralded a hero by the mainstream media.  But it has just been amazing to see the ebb and flow of international relations. And reflecting back as I did earlier today, as so much from my Democratic friends in Judiciary was made about connections between the Trump administration and Russia, it is just hard not to remember so vividly the comments by Mitt Romney in a debate with President Obama in 2012 that Russia was potentially the greatest threat.  I may be mistaken, but it seems like President Obama even said something glibly like, you know, ``The 1980s called and they want their foreign policy back,'' something rather cheeky like that, when, actually, my friends across the aisle, in Judiciary at least, have come to realize that that was one thing Mitt Romney was right about and President Obama was wrong about.  But if you look at what the Obama administration did, as soon as President Obama took office, instead of taking a principle stand--and I know there was a lot of perceived hatred by those coming in with the Obama administration for George Perhaps it goes back to President Obama's days when he was growing up in Indonesia and he commented in his book, ``Dreams from My Father,'' about how his stepfather was apparently paid off by these fat-cat guys from Texas, oil guys, fat cats from Texas and Louisiana, something to that effect, and you realized, holy smokes, he has had a great disdain for Texas, for Louisiana going back to, you know, preteen years. You couldn't help but wonder if, in policies, it was carried through. Of course, he didn't appreciate his stepfather for working, and working with the Americans back in those days. But perhaps that has affected him.  So if George Bush took a principled stand against Russia after Russia assaulted the independent nation of Georgia--I mean, some of us remember that President George Bush, trying to look for the good in people, came back from meeting Putin and said, you know: I looked into his eyes and saw his soul. He thought that is what he saw--may have been looking into shark eyes. But in any event, he soon learned the error of his ways. And that is one of the things I liked about President George If he made a mistake, he was big enough to say that wasn't the right way to go, and he would try to fix it.  That is exactly what he did in his relationship with When Russia attacked Georgia--unprovoked, really--President George Bush, his administration, properly took a very principled stand. Some didn't think it went far enough, but he immediately caused a cessation of the great relations that had been going on and took some steps to chill those relations because of Russia's unilateral attack against Georgia, hoping to wake Putin up that you can't just go attack a neighboring country like that. Even if you want the old Soviet Empire back, you can't just do that without repercussions. So because of Putin's imperialistic attack, Bush took a strong stance and let Russia know: We don't approve of what you have done, and we are cooling things, we are freezing things.[[Page H1232]]  One of the first things that occurred after President Obama took office, he sent his new Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, to meet with the Russians and they had this red plastic button--looked pretty cheap, but it was supposed to have said ``reset,'' but apparently, they couldn't get the translation right. I am not sure what it said, peregruzka. I don't know what it said. I don't know what it was. But somebody that didn't know how to translate ``reset'' put it on and delivered the wrong message.  But the more important message that Secretary Clinton and President Obama delivered to the rather ruthless imperialist leader of Russia was this: George Bush overreacted when you attacked your neighbor, Georgia, Mr.Putin, and we want you to know, we don't have a problem with you attacking Georgia, attacking your neighbors, trying to take over their territory. So we are here with big smiles and big laughs because we want to be such a good friend of yours, and we think it is perfectly fine what you are doing. We think you are terrific.                              {time}  1845  That is the message after Bush let Putin know: Wait a minute. We are not going to let you be the big bully in the world.  But the Obama administration sent a very clear message: We are not We don't have a problem with you attacking  And it is hard to think anything but that message that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, as our President, sent to Putin was clear: We would be okay if you attacked Ukraine, You know, we are okay with that. If it is adjoining, yeah, yeah, attack away.  What else is Putin supposed to think when President Bush reacts harshly when he attacks a neighboring country, and the new President comes in and says: We are fine with everything you are doing. We are nothing but smiles and plastic red buttons. We are good. We don't mind anything you have done. We want to be your good friend.  If the message from that was not clear enough, before he was reelected in 2012, a microphone he didn't realize could pick him up, picked up our President telling the President of Russia: Basically tell Vladimir I will have a lot more flexibility after the election.  Well, now that could only have one meaning, and that is, I got to look tough and like I am standing up tough to Putin right now before the 2012 election, but make sure Putin knows that after the election I can give the farm a whole lot easier. I can let him do a whole lot more that he wants to do. We can be a lot more chummy once I get past my second and last election as So you make sure Vlad knows--my bosom buddy over there, my best friend forever--I am going to be able to work with him like he wants me to once I get past the next election.  So with those kind of messages, then, as if it wasn't enough, followed up by another message to Russia and the world when he stated that, basically, if President al-Assad in Syria used gas on people in Syria, that would be a red line. And if he crossed it, obviously we would have to do something. He created a red line. Nobody asked him to.  Putin picks up messages like that. For all of the problems he presents, one problem he does not present is where he stands, where he wants to go, and what motivates him. He's very clear.  I have never met the man, but I have studied enough about Russia, and I have learned enough about Putin to know exactly who he is, what he is capable of, what he wants to do. And it is pretty clear: He wants to rebuild his empire. He hates the United He blames the United States for the fall of the glorious Soviet Union, that great USSR that once ruled the waves and the world. He wants a grand return to those days, and he wants to be the leader like Khrushchev or Really, he would rather be in the nature of  As Stalin himself once said, a translation: With power, dizziness. Stalin said that, and he should certainly know.  I think probably Putin has run into that as he has gotten all this glamour. During the Obama years, so many magazines and journalists just couldn't get enough of Putin with his shirt off. I mean, it may have helped the sex status of--as the status symbol of people who were bald. Maybe I should be proud and happy for that, but it didn't seem to affect me at all.  But there was so much laid on the shoulders--the mantle laid by the Obama administration on the shoulders of And when that didn't seem to work out very well, it looked like the next big step was to ingratiate this Nation's Presidency, administration to the most evil leaders in the world, those who are leading  They can be an evil empire all by themselves. They have wreaked so much havoc in the world. So many of the Americans that died liberating Iraq, lost their lives at the hands of IEDs or other weapons of war inflicted on them by Iranians--are sent to Iraq from  There is a big price to pay for mistakes in judgment of  I believe Donald Trump will ultimately end up being one of the greatest Presidents in foreign relations because I think he is going to figure out, as George Bush did, Putin is not someone you can trust. You need to understand where he is coming from and where he wants to go. And you can use him when it is to our advantage against a common enemy. But make no mistake, he would glory in the fall of the United  He is wrong about why the Soviet Union fell. It fell because it was based on communism, totalitarianism, and it was destined to fall.  I could see that during the summer that I was there as an exchange student, and I went out to a collective farm. And being from East Texas, I worked on farms and ranches. And during summer, as this was sometime in July, I went out to a collective farm there; and there were massive acres, huge numbers of acres out there.  I couldn't really tell what was being cultivated and what wasn't, what even the crop was. It didn't look good. It was brown. I couldn't get over how sad things looked out there. This was down in the Ukraine, the bread basket of what was the Soviet Union at the time.  I know that if you are going to work around the latitude that that was in Ukraine--similar to ours back in Texas--in the summer, you best start around sun up so that you don't have to work when the Sun reaches its hottest time in the day.  Seeing all of the farmers gathered in the shade there near the center of the village--a little town they had there--they were all sitting in the shade midmorning. I tried to use my best Russian that I could speak at the time and asked them, tried to use a smile: You know, when do you work out in the field?  They laughed. I thought, well, maybe I messed up a word and made it into a weird translation.  Then one of them spoke up in Russian, and he said: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the field or if I am here in the shade--if I am out there in the Sun or here in the shade, so I am here in the shade.  I thought at the time that is why socialism, communism could never work. If you are going to pay people the same thing not to work as you do the people who are working, then eventually most people are not going to work.  It is a good thing to have a safety net for those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves unemployed; but you can't turn into a Socialist nation where you reward people--provide the safety net, sure--but you can't provide incentives to sit in the shade and not work at all. Because eventually some day, your people will go hungry and your nation will fail as a nation-state, and it did. There were many factors that contributed, but the bottom line is that type of system can never work in this world, in this life.  The Pilgrims tried it in that beautiful Mayflower Compact where they were all going to work and bring into the common storehouse and share. It was just a beautiful, lovely way to approach things.  I have loved looking, as I did last night, at the painting there in the rotunda reflecting the Pilgrims' famous prayer meeting there in It says ``Speedwell'' right under the platform where they were. They were on the ship, the Speedwell, before they left in two ships--the big Speedwell and the small Mayflower--and went over to  The Speedwell, the big ship that was going to allow them to take so many more to the new land, America, began[[Page H1233]]taking on water, for whatever reason. There were different things said about what may have been the cause.  But for whatever reason, they had to do a bit like Gideon did. They had to winnow it down to the people that had the best chance of making it to America so they could fit on that small So they winnowed the group down. They came over on the  It was a beautiful thing, loving, working hard as they did. But when such a huge number of their settlers died during that first winter, basically, the short version, they ultimately tried something new resembling private property: You take your property. You grow. You use it however you want. And whatever you grow and produce, that is yours.  It's amazing that worked out so well. Unlike the collective farms in the Soviet Union, there was incentive to work hard, produce, and people thrived, did so well. That actually gave a lot of incentive to others. Hey, this private property thing can work out well.  Here, all these years later, we have people wanting to go back to that way of life that has failed every time it has been tried. Even when the Apostle Paul tried it, he ultimately had to throw up his hands and say: New rule. If you don't work, you don't eat.  Because the socialist way of doing things in this world is not going to work.  I am glad that my friends who were so vocal about not wanting a strong relationship with the current leader of Russia, I am glad they finally realized what those of us on the Republican side--most of us--have been saying for a very long time. Yeah, we can work with the Russians to defeat our common enemy, but you should never lose sight of the fact Putin does not really want us for friends. He wants to see this country gone. He wants to see our way of life fail. So just don't lose sight of that.  It is also interesting--we had amendments being proposed today with the same theme being repeated constantly about a Muslim ban, in essence, that we should not ever take religion into account when it comes to immigration. That has no place.  Yet, when our chairman, one of our other Members brought up the--I believe it was Raul Labrador--the Lautenberg amendment that so many of us support, when you know a group of people--such as the Jewish people in another part of the world--are being killed and they are being persecuted, when we know that is taking place, it is a good thing to consider who they are and that their religion is being persecuted.  When there are Christians in another part of the world being persecuted beyond what other religions are, it is a good thing to try to help them.                              {time}  1900  When there were Muslims being persecuted in Eastern Europe, the Clinton administration responded, came to their aid. And for those that say, gee, standing up to radical Islam will only encourage more recruitment--my word--how much worse can it get than it has gotten during the last 8 years?  There was no President Obama took office, Afghanistan, they were still fighting; but actually, the Taliban had been totally--any organized Taliban had been destroyed by February of 2002, and we hadn't lost a single American life. We had used--we had let the Northern Alliance, residents, citizens in Afghanistan, we let them fight our enemy because, though they were Muslim, most of them, they didn't want radical Islamists running  A mistake was made after our friends in the Northern Alliance totally routed the We sent in tens of thousands of American troops, and our friends, who loved us and heralded us for our liberation from the Taliban in Afghanistan, began to look at us as occupiers. I have been to Afghanistan enough. I have seen the way that relationship has gone, from us being the heroes that liberated their country from these radical Islamists that were a bane to the existence of just peace-loving Muslims wanting to live and not be terrorized by radical Islamists, and somehow we ended up becoming bad guys to so much of the country because of our massive presence.  I do believe, Mr.Speaker, there is potential with all of the chaos that is beginning to raise its head again in I heard a report this morning that Afghans had confided to a Republican here in town when he was over there visiting that al-Qaida is even back in So it is not just the Taliban back stronger than ever; now al-Qaida is back in  And what was the cost to America, to our military over the last 8 years in allowing the Taliban to come back stronger than they were originally, to al-Qaida, to come back in Afghanistan stronger than they were originally? My personal opinion, I believe it was because of President Obama's rules of engagement. But we lost four times more precious military lives in Afghanistan during President Obama's command than were lost during just under 8 years under Commander George  How could we lose four times more American military and suffer such a setback over the last 8 years, where we are back maybe a little worse off than things were when we went in to Afghanistan in October of 2001? Well, it has to do with the commitment. I heard former Vice President Cheney say that when President Obama announced he is committed to Afghanistan and he sent a surge into Afghanistan, he also announced, what seemed almost simultaneously, and we are going to be out in 18 months.  As we know from history, nobody that ever won a war, a police action, a confrontation, ever set a deadline: We are going to win by this date or we are coming out, whether we have won or not. That message went out loud and clear to the Taliban that was growing back that if we can just hang on for 18 months, we will own Afghanistan all over again.  I understand that, apparently, General Harwood, that has apparently been named by President Trump as the new National Security Adviser--and Mr.Speaker, I am sorry. I have got to say this because of what Billy and Karen Vaughn have come to mean to me since I met them some years back, after the death of their SEAL Team 6 son, Gosh, I have come to know--I never met him while he was alive, but I have come to know him and feel like I knew him as a friend and as one of his admirers, vicariously, through his parents, Billy and  When I heard the general's name come back up as one of those being considered, I thought, oh, please, surely not, because Billy and Karen made clear, you know, as family members were finding out what happened there in Afghanistan that took the most SEAL team lives we had ever had, they went onto a Chinook that should not have carried our SEAL team members. They went onto this Chinook and, supposedly, going on a mission, and yet because of the rules laid down by President Obama and his administration, they had to make sure that the Afghans knew exactly what was going to occur, where they were going, what they were going to do.  Even knowing that after Vice President Joe Biden's gaffe, where he released classified information, that it was the SEALs who took out Osama bin Laden, it wasn't supposed to come out. It was another gaffe. But immediately, Bill and Karen said, after Biden outed the SEALs and it came out it was SEAL Team 6, they got a call from Aaron saying: Hey, you need to get off social media. The radical Islamists are going to be looking for us, for our family members.  So this administration put big targets on SEAL Team 6 by disclosing classified information that ultimately led to their deaths, and it put targets on family members of SEAL Team 6. I know they didn't mean to do it. I know it wasn't intentional. They just didn't realize how serious things were.  I know they must not have realized, or at least President Obama must not have realized, how serious it was when I watched the video of the gentleman that was called his body man, was with him through so many days, and he was answering questions at a university in It has been some years back that I watched. But he was asked, in effect, what was it like being with President Obama when he went into the room where they were watching SEAL Team 6 go after Osama bin He basically said: Oh, we didn't stay in there long. The President looked in but said, ``I'm not watching this,'' and they[[Page H1234]]went and played cards, several hands of cards, while the SEAL Team 6 was putting their lives on the line for their country.  So if that is your way of thinking, then it is understandable that you wouldn't appreciate the dangers in which you put SEAL Team 6 when you out them as the people who went after Osama bin But they knew, and the chatter was clear, and it was loud. They wanted to take casualties and get a price back with lives of SEAL Team 6 members.  The mission that they were on should have ended right then, when the Afghan commander came up. They knew where they were going. He comes up and pulls off their elite soldiers, off the Chinook helicopter, and replaced them with people whose names were not on the manifest. Well, under the rules, that should have ended the task, should have ended the operation right there. They were told to go on, so they went--I have seen the transcript of testimony, statements--by gunship, C-130 gunship in the area. They had all kinds of imaging.  And this isn't classified because this was on the DVD that was given to the family members. They were later asked if they would give it back. They didn't realize quite how much information they had put. Yeah, they sure didn't because the family members, like the Vaughns, watched it, read it, found out what was on it.  We had a C-130 gunship, and I--my 4 years on Active Duty in the Army, I was never in combat. I think we should have gone into combat in Iran when an act of war occurred and our embassy was attacked. But that was Commander-in-Chief Carter's call, and he decided not to send anybody. I think if he had responded within 48 hours and said, ``You either release our hostages, or we are sending our United States military, and you better not hurt them or there will be a powerful price paid by you and your country,'' I think they would have released them. I think that is why, probably--I mean, I was watching closely from Fort All of us were watching the news. Were any of us going to be sent?  The Ayatollah had a spokesman. I have not seen anything about it since I watched back in those days, `79, but I recall him. It was very interesting. For a few days, he kept distinguishing that it was the students that attacked the U.It was the students that had the hostages.  I said to some of my Army friends at Fort Benning: I think he is afraid Carter's going to send our military, and he is using the students as a back door for him. So if Carter shows a backbone and says, ``You either release our hostages or we are sending--you are going to feel the full vengeance of the United States military,'' they had a back door. It gave the Ayatollah an opportunity to save face by saying: You don't have to do it. We have negotiated with the students. Here are your hostages back. You don't have to invade Iran and take out our administration. See, we are your friend. We helped you out.  But after a few days, I am not sure exactly what it was, but after a few days, it was clear, I think, to the Iranian leaders that this President is not going to do anything. He is just going to ask us to let their people go, and so we don't have to worry. They began to say ``we have the hostages'' because they knew Carter wasn't going to do anything.  I still believe, based on what I learned at Fort Benning, that if President Carter had allowed all the helicopters to go that I was told were originally requested, then there would not have been one chopper--they had to have six to be able to make it the 500 miles into the staging area there in As has come out publicly, they all knew, if we don't get six choppers out of the--eight was all the Carter administration would allow to go. They should have sent 12 because they expected to have a 50 percent loss, turbine engines going across sand like that 500 miles. They knew they had to have six or the mission was an automatic abort.  As we know, when only five got there and it was clear there was not another one coming, then it was aborted. As I understand, the investigation indicated the helicopter pilot, as sand swirled around his chopper, must have gotten vertigo and not relied on his instruments. The helicopter tilted. The blade went through the C-130, and everybody on the chopper and the C-130 was killed.                              {time}  1915  But, once again, we were embarrassed because we didn't have a Commander in Chief that was totally committed to doing what it took to get our hostages out. Again, I will always believe, if he had shown a backbone within 48 hours of our embassy being attacked and our hostages being taken, there would be thousands of American military lives still in being today.  So having witnessed firsthand lessons of poor decisions by Commanders in Chief, having seen the data, the statistics of dead American military in Afghanistan, four times more under Commander Obama than under Commander Bush in approximately near the same amount of time, we haven't learned the lessons of the past very well.  I feel absolutely confident that the President is going to learn his lessons. He has made a couple of mistakes. And certainly I agree, you can't have a National Security Adviser that is not completely honest with the Vice President and the President; you just can't. You have to be able to totally trust him. That has been a problem in our intelligence community. They were leaking and undermining President Bush, and now it is happening again to President  So as I was talking about SEAL Team Six, these devastated families that had lost the greatest military members that we could have lost at that point, their every life is just priceless, invaluable. But there was so much money spent in training up these SEAL teams. It is an investment. You need to make sure they have the right equipment, that you don't have Afghans pulled off that are the best fighting members that Afghanistan has, and you put what they considered expendable Afghanistan soldiers on with our elite SEAL Team Six, especially when you know there are targets on their backs.  But when the families met General Harward, they said they were just so crushed, they were so devastated, and they found out that this AC-130 gunship, that there were opportunities to take out this patrol, this team, that shot down the Chinook and our SEAL team members. And there were other precious American lives on that helicopter in addition to the SEAL Team Six members, and they should not be shorted in when we owe them and their memories.  But they asked if they had an opportunity to take these guys out. And the crew said they did. They had the thermal imaging. They could see these guys moving like military. They could see them moving up to the high point and getting ready to fire. They asked for permission to take them out, and they were denied permission to take them out. They watched them fire over and over at the helicopters with the rocket-propelled grenades apparently of some kind, and they missed with the first one. As I understand it, they were still not allowed to shoot them down, take out the Afghan rebels. They fired again, and they fired again. And the second and third took out our precious American military members along with those precious Afghan lives who should never have been on that helicopter to begin with.  Then they watched them dismantle their equipment and start to climb down. They asked permission to take them out, it is my understanding, and, once again, they were told there may be civilians in the area, so, no, do not fire; and they watched them fade back into the population of Afghanistan after killing so many of our SEAL Team Six and others on the helicopter.  They asked the general who is now apparently going to be our National Security Adviser: Why didn't you take out these people, these Afghan radical Islamists? Why didn't you take them out before they took out our military members, our SEAL Team Six? Why?  His statement, from their memory, as related to me, was, in essence: Because we were trying to win hearts and minds.  Our National Security Adviser is going to be more interested in--or at least he has in the past--apparently has been more interested in winning hearts and minds of people that hate our guts than he is of protecting the most precious assets the United States of America has: American lives.[[Page H1235]]  We haven't won any hearts and minds by allowing SEAL Team Six--so many of those members on that Chinook--to be killed. We haven't. That strategy didn't work.  I am sorry. I want to be supportive. I was excited President Trump won, but when I know how this man, who I understand today has now been named to be the new National Security Adviser, was given the task of encouraging and being empathetic to the family members who lost those precious American family members in that Chinook that should never have been shot down, it should never have been allowed to take off, and the best he could do is say: Sorry, they had to die because we were trying to win hearts and minds instead of win the war.  I hope that his mentality has changed. I hope he will not be willing to expend the best trained, the best and brightest military members we have, as he tries to win hearts and minds instead of trying to win a battle and win the war; but I guess time will tell.  Mr.Speaker, I want to finish by saluting all those brave Americans that have defended freedom, that have fought for America, and who have responded in a voluntary military since 1979 and given their lives at the hands of radical I hope and pray this President will pick people from here who will have the same feelings about precious American lives.  I know Donald Trump does, and I think he will be a good I think he blew it on this call, but time will tell.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1231.txt,1801,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February
1424,topic-id,3897,"Mr.Speaker, we are back in session. We were out of session last week. It was great to get all over east It is just good to be an east Texan and from around east I had occasion to talk to a whole bunch of folks from part of my district, even tonight.  As I think about the headlines, I think about this group called Indivisible demanding townhalls, and I keep coming back to last Monday at Jack Ryan's restaurant in downtown Tyler Young Professionals had asked me to speak there. I knew the gentleman that had white hair and looked distinguished was probably not one of the Tyler Young Professionals but probably one of the Indivisible people, the Democrats that--yes, some of them say they are nonpartisan, but so much for that. But I knew when I called on him to ask the first question, he probably wasn't one of the Tyler Young  I offered to him, I said: Look, I give you my word. You come, bring somebody with you. Let's sit down at a conference table and I will hear you out. I will give you a chance.  No, he said. That is not what I want. I demand a townhall.  So I keep coming back to that answer because that seems to make very, very clear this whole Indivisible movement. It is not about being heard. That can be best done, as the Founders realized when they put together the Constitution--a complete democracy is where you have mob rule, that a majority is always going to prevail; but they figured out that, far better than having a big mob rule so you don't end up with lynchings and crowds convincing themselves to do something dramatic that they would never, ever do individually--it would be too much of a violation of their conscience. But there is something about a group dynamic that people can get whipped up into a frenzy as a group that doesn't happen when you sit down one-on-one with them.  So this has never been about townhalls. It has never been about being heard. It has been about headlines, trying to intimidate some of us from keeping the promises that we made to our constituents before we got elected.  I think God has a way of preparing us for what lies ahead. Had I not been a felony judge for a decade and been threatened by all kinds of felons, then I might have been at least somewhat intimidated. But it all seems rather interesting, this frenzy. Really good, decent people get in a group and get worked up into a frenzy.  One of them did ask an interesting question there in east Texas on the east Texas Indivisible Facebook page: Well, what would be wrong with sitting down with him on an individual basis or something like that? That individual understood that, if all we want is to be heard, why wouldn't we just want to sit down and talk.  What that individual didn't understand is Indivisible is not about being heard. It is exactly about what is in the Indivisible playbook, the The idea is to disrupt those who won with a majority of the vote in congressional seats and Senate seats, disrupt those who won with a majority and prevent them from keeping their promises.  It reminded me somewhat of what happened back when George H.Bush was He had run saying, ``Read my lips: no new taxes.'' I wasn't in politics back when he was running and saying that, but I sure got involved in late 1991, I guess December, and in 1992. I guess that was back in the 1988 election.[[Page H1351]]  It cost him the 1992 election because he kept saying, ``Read my lips: no new taxes.'' Then he had to deal with the majority of Democrats in the House and They kept luring, trying to suck him in: Come on, if we are going to reach an agreement, you are going to have to give up on that pledge just a little bit, just a little bit. We are not going to reach it. You are going to have to give up just a little bit. You are going to have to allow just a little bit of a tax.  After enough cajoling, they finally convinced George H.Bush that they were not going to allow the bill to go through unless he had at least a little bit of a tax increase. As soon as they lured him into that--kind of sounds like something that happened in the Garden of But as soon as they lured him into it and he agreed to a very small increase in taxes, then immediately the cries became: You are a liar. You broke your promise of no new taxes.  He got lured into it. He thought they were acting in good faith, when all they were trying to do was get him to break his promise so they could call him a liar. They lured him into it. They trapped him into it. He should have told them, ``Read my lips: no new taxes.'' But being a benevolent man, he thought they were acting in good faith, as he was, and he found out differently. It cost him the 1992 election.  So we have people demanding: Oh, yes, just give us the townhall. That is all we want. Just give us the townhall. They know and most of us, thank goodness, on my side of the aisle know, if we give the bullying mobs, what they are demanding when they are saying: We are going to harass you--as one man did--we are going to harass you at church, everywhere you go, until you finally give in, fine. No matter how big the mobs get, no matter how mean and frenzied they get, no matter how big of bullies they become, I know what I promised my constituents and I know what we have got to deliver.  I am starting to hear from people on my side of the aisle: Well, maybe we shouldn't repeal. Maybe we shouldn't do what we did in 2015.  Everything we did in 2015 was consistent with the rules that are in play right now. We ought to be able to do the same thing again. We should. We did it in 2015. We ought to be able to do it now--we just should--House Members and Senate We had a majority both places then. We have got a majority now. We need to do it again.  We don't have to have this huge government program as a replacement. That is the beauty of a free market. But in order to have a free market, you have got to have honesty and integrity in the system. That means nobody on my side of the aisle, nobody in the Senate on the Republican side of the aisle, and nobody in the White House should be intimidated no matter how frenzied the insurance lobby may become about what we can't do.  Those same people embraced ObamaCare, which was about to destroy them. Some of them said: Well, you have got to understand we had to have a seat at the table. I tried to explain, you don't want a seat at the table when you are on the menu. But no, they dove in. Big Pharma and those folks dove right in.  Now, I could understand AARP jumping in and endorsing ObamaCare even though it cut Medicare by $716 billion, even though it stabbed seniors in the back by dramatic cuts to I could understand AARP endorsing They were going to be able to sell more insurance than they had ever sold before.  I had seen 1 year before--I think it was 2007 or 2008--they had over $4 million in profit, which is pretty good for a nonprofit, selling insurance or endorsing the policies that were sold. So, of course, then you get to the deal in ObamaCare that all these other policies are going to have an extra 2 percent tax on them, but not the kind of policies you sell.  I can understand AARP getting behind ObamaCare, even though it did so much damage to the health care of seniors because they were going to make a lot of money. No telling how much money they have made since ObamaCare passed.  I couldn't understand health insurance companies. I couldn't understand Big I guess I could, because they were going to make tens of billions of dollars more in the short run than they had made in the past. That is why President Obama got them to offer to give billions of it back. You don't get billions given back unless you are going to make a lot more billions than you put back. I am sure they did, but that was short term. If ObamaCare continued into the future, it wouldn't be--probably within the next decade that you would see them heading toward their demise.                              {time}  2130  But the big executives would be fine. They would have gotten their golden parachute and taken off with all the money that appeared to be rolling in at that point, even though the day of reckoning was going to come for them down the road.  But we shouldn't be listening to people who sold out knowing they will make money short term, but it probably will destroy them long term. People who were guided by the mentality that embraced that bill should not be dictating what is in the replacement plan. And I say plan, because when you are going to use free market to have a better healthcare environment, you have got to have free market; and you can't have free market unless everybody knows how much things cost.  I was seeing again tonight from constituents, people think they ought to know how much a medical visit costs. Whether it is Blue Cross, Aetna, Humana, Anthem, whether it is an HMO, whatever, they ought to know how much that costs, whoever is paying for it. Whether it is the government--whether it is the Federal Government, State government, whether it is an insurance company, people have a right to know what a medical visit, procedure, whatever it is--they have a right to know how much it costs.  Only when we have truth in treatment are we going to be able to fix so many of the wrongs in health care. Then we can move toward a free market, where insurance will have a high deductible. This is the ultimate goal, I think, where you have a high deductible, but you will have every dime of that deductible in a health savings account either put in there by your employer or by you. In a proper program, it ought to be every dime of it put in there pretax, no tax on that money that you put in there. I still believe that every dime that is put in there should then be marked for health care only. If the person owning that health savings account passes away before it is spent for health care, it ought to keep that healthcare designation and roll over into the heirs' health savings account. And if there are not heirs or it's not in the will, it could go to a charity's health savings account, as I feel sure you would have every worthwhile charity set up a health savings account that could be used to have people donate from their own health savings accounts to help the poor, help those who are chronically ill.  As a Christian, I believe God knew it blesses us, it helps us as individuals when we are charitable toward others. That does not mean when the government, with the threat of the IRS, some SWAT team behind them, or some threat to come take your home, all of your assets, says you will give so that we can give to who the government thinks should receive the charity--that is not charity. That is not charity at all. That is a much too powerful government.  What we find is that the United States has been the most charitable country in the history of the world. We have got a lot of benevolent Of course, that doesn't include George He makes his money. It seems like one of the ways he makes money is if he can topple an economy, bring it down; and through all of the suffering that is brought about, he makes money.  When we heard tape recordings made in the past year by people who were saying, ``Oh, yeah, we funded the violence at those Trump rallies,'' or ``We funded violence here, there or yon,'' or ``We funded efforts to help bring down this activity or that activity,'' then it sure seems like that is worthy of investigation, because what you have when you have people giving money to create violence at events, some people would call that basically a racketeer influenced and corrupt organization, It ought to be worthy of investigation. If people are giving money when they[[Page H1352]]should know that money is going to be contributed to create chaos, get somebody hurt, then it sure seems like that is the kind of criminal conduct people have gone to prison for.  I hope our new Justice Department will continue its trend toward getting out of litigation that they never should have been in in the first place and getting in where there is corruption. We know under the Attorney General Eric Holder that as long as the people who were carrying billy clubs and threatening voters outside of polling places were Democrats, then certainly they did not need to be investigated, nothing needed to be done to them because they are Apparently under that old Department of Justice that was just about them, just us, then as long as it is one of us, we don't need to prosecute them. But, whoa, if it is a Republican, yeah, we need to go after them.  But the great irony is there could be no greater dissolution of the right to vote when then loading the deck with people who have no right to vote, who vote and completely dissolve law-abiding people's right to vote, you just canceled out their right to vote with illegality. So it seems strange to some of us that you would have a Justice Department that would say: No, no, no, don't you dare purge those records of the dead people. You have got to leave those dead people in. Some of those dead people may want to vote. It is important to let dead people vote if they feel like voting.  To have a Department of Justice that doesn't want counties to clean up their voter registration so that there can't be fraud, people that are dead, people that are living in other States or other voting districts don't come and also vote there. It just was incredible lawlessness to have a Department of Justice fighting against cleaning up voter registration rolls so that only people alive and living in that district could vote.  Why would anybody do that? Why would anybody fight against cleaning up voter registration?  The only reason I can think of conceivably would be they must still want people who are dead or don't live there to vote illegally. What else could there be?  I mean, there are some people willing to have the Department of Justice: We are even okay if you supervise to make sure we don't throw out somebody who is alive. But this Justice Department under President Obama's administration, they didn't want voter registration rolls cleaned up.  The lawlessness, thankfully, has come to an end. I know that there are people who have been stirring up fear in American hearts about Jeff Sessions, but Jeff Sessions is a good man. He is a good person. He will enforce the law fairly across the board, and I am grateful that we finally have a Justice Department that will be about justice.  In the meantime, I saw this story today from Peter Hasson from The Daily Caller:  ``Leaked audio from an anti-Trump protest group meeting reveals activists with anti-Trump group Indivisible plotting how to best manufacture a hostile environment at a town hall with Republican Bill Cassidy in Breaux Bridge, . . .  ``The audio, obtained by local radio station KPEL, reveals a coordinated effort to create the public impression that Cassidy's support for Trump is unpopular with his constituents. The activists, who describe themselves as liberals in the audio, can be heard strategizing how to best turn a local town hall into a political victory.  ``The activists split up into an `inside team'--tasked with occupying `as many seats as we can' and an `outside team,' whose job was to `give the media the coverage they want' before joining the others inside. Activists were instructed to dress like conservatives and leave at home `any signifier that you're a liberal' in order to blend in with constituents.  ``The leftist activists strategized how best to `dominate' the question-and-answer section of the town hall and keep anyone `sympathetic' to Cassidy from asking a question.  ``The audio also reveals the activists laughing about `the poor people of Breaux Bridge'--local constituents--who might get stuck behind them. Local news coverage of the town hall said that `many attendees were turned away' from the town hall due to `capacity restrictions.'  ``'Game plan number one is to fill as many seats as we can, right? If it's all of us in there and the poor people of Breaux Bridge are sitting behind us, well then tough luck for them,' said one organizer, identified by KPEL as James His `poor people' comment drew laughs from the other activists.  `` `If we can arrange it so he doesn't hear one sympathetic question--great. That only magnifies our impact,' Proctor said.  ``KPEL identified Proctor as the leader of Indivisible Acadiana, a local branch of the national Indivisible organization, which has organized hostile Republican town halls all around the country.  `` `The Indivisible Guide does say that when you start to lose the meeting, that's when you boo and hiss,' one unidentified activist can be heard saying. `Right, I was going to say that,' another activist replied. Local news outlet The Advertiser reported that members of the crowd `frequently interrupted, expressing disagreement with some of Cassidy's positions and shouting out their own questions.'  `` `The outside team will join the inside team in the hall after media coverage'. . . . `So what we'll do is we'll try to dominate enough, because--remember, the camera people especially are looking for some `b-roll' and some quotes.'  `` `They've got three or four things to cover that day, this is just one of them'. . . . `So we make sure we give them the coverage they want, and then everyone breaks and goes inside.' ''  That reminds me of an article that was written in Gregg County, the largest newspaper. Obviously they know what Indivisible is, and they were demanding a townhall belittling me. It just shows how partisan, how malicious. They showed their malice toward me repeatedly. Fortunately, for the people of east Texas, they don't count for a whole lot. Their opinion is so biased; it is what it is. They know that these people are doing just what is talked about here, what is talked about in the Indivisible handbook, and that is what they want. They want me out of office, and there is such a problem with envy, with emotions that I have just never had like that. They can't stand it.  So, anyway, here is one, Todd Starnes from FOX News, today's article:  ``A group of enraged protesters exploded in anger after a chaplain prayed in the name of Jesus at a town hall meeting in Louisiana hosted by U.Bill  ``The verbally-abusive crowd''--and it is talking about this same townhall that this tape came from, where they were plotting and planning to disrupt and to keep the people from Breaux Bridge from actually being able to participate in their own townhall.                              {time}  2145  Anyway:  ``Louisiana State chaplain Michael Sprague and the unidentified Vietnam War veteran should be commended for maintaining their composure in the face of verbal barbarism.  ``The February 22, town hall meeting in Metairie, was quickly overrun by the angry mob--much like other town hall meetings hosted by Republican lawmakers across the country.  ``The mainstream media would have us believe the unruly demonstrations are part of an organic, grassroots effort.  ``But I sincerely doubt many in the mob were actually residents of Louisiana--because I know the good people of Louisiana and nobody behaves like that in the Bayou  ``Folks are raised right in Cajun There's no way anybody would embarrass their mommas by acting the fool in public.  ``I'd be willing to bet a cup of Community Coffee that the Jesus-hating rabble-rousers were shipped in from some God-forsaken place like Berkeley or Brooklyn.''  Now, I don't agree on  Anyway:  ``Chaplain Sprague had barely invoked the name of the Almighty when the heckling began.  `` `Pray on your own time. This is our time,' someone shouted. `Let's get on with it.'[[Page H1353]]  ``Others chanted, `Separation of church and state' and so on and so forth. Someone filmed the prayer and words do not do justice to the amount of hate directed at the chaplain.  `` `I've never been shouted down throughout a time of prayer like that,' Chaplain Sprague told me. `I've never been in a situation like that. It's sad there wasn't honor and respect for God.'  ``But they became absolutely unhinged when he concluded his prayer in the name of  `` `Wow, they booed the name of Jesus,' Cassidy said in remarks reported by the Times- ``I thought several of the agitators were going to spontaneously combust.  ``The chaplain said the overwhelming majority of people in the room were causing a disruption--but he harbors no ill will toward the mob.  `` `I'm not mad at people. My heart is bigger than that,' he said. `My heart's prayer is that everybody be treated with dignity and respect.'  ``The chaplain was especially disappointed by how the mob insulted the Vietnam War veteran.  `` `There was a lot of shouting. Some turned their backs. Many didn't stand or put their hand on their heart,' he said.  ``Infuriating, but not surprising.  ``As I wrote in `The Deplorables' Guide to Making America Great Again' liberals have a strong aversion to President Trump, Jesus and Old  ``But I still have hope in America.''  And I share that.  There is a lot to be grateful for, but one is not this article from CBN News in Jerusalem, Israel:  ``A Palestinian Arab terrorist convicted of murdering two Israeli university students is one of the leaders of the feminist protest movement against U.President Donald  ``Rasmeah Yousef Odeh, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is helping to organize a `Day without a Woman' on March 8, Arutz Sheva quotes reports in The New York Post and The Guardian.''

1367,topic-id,441,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I begin by thanking Representative Doug Collins of Georgia and the Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee Ranking Member Steve Cohen of Tennessee for introducing this important government transparency legislation.  Every year, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, the Federal Government, through settlement or court order, pays millions of dollars in legal fees and costs to parties to lawsuits and administrative adjudications that involve the Federal  However, despite the large amount of taxpayer dollars paid out each year, the Federal Government no longer comprehensively keeps track of the amount of fees and other expenses awarded pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, nor does the government compile and report on why these fees and expenses were paid and to whom these costs were awarded.  This is because, in 1995, Congress repealed the Department of Justice's reporting requirements and defunded the Administrative Conference of the United States, the agency charged with reporting this basic information.  The Administrative Conference was established in 2010, but the requirements to report on fee and cost payments have not been reenacted. Accordingly, there has been no official governmentwide accounting of this information since fiscal year 1994, over 20 years ago.  This lack of transparency is troubling, given that the Equal Access to Justice Act is considered by many to be the most important Federal fee-shifting statute. Fundamentally, the act recognizes that there is an enormous disparity of resources between the Federal Government and individuals and small businesses who seek to challenge Federal actions.                              {time}  1715  Congress enacted the Equal Access to Justice Act to provide individuals, small businesses, and small nonprofit groups with financial incentives to challenge the Federal Government or defend themselves from lawsuits brought by the Federal As the Supreme Court has noted, the act was adopted with the specific purpose of eliminating for the average person the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.  But how can we know if the act is working well toward this end if we have no data on awards? Without the data this bill requires the Administrative Conference to compile and report, we have nothing more than anecdotal evidence as to whether the act is providing some measure of relief to the financial disincentive to seeking judicial and administrative redress against the Federal  The legislation we are considering today will end this lack of transparency and restore the reporting requirements that were repealed in 1995.

696,topic-id,533,"Mr.Speaker, on August 5, 2016, the Obama administration published another overreaching regulation that threatens the authority of States nationwide to manage fish and wildlife.  Specifically, the new rule undermines Alaska's authority to manage fish and wildlife on State, private, and Federal lands. The new regulation destroys the cooperative relationship between the State of Alaska and the agency that historically worked well.  This power grab threatens management policies and wildlife refuges nationwide and, if allowed to stand, will set a dangerous precedent for future top-down mandates from the Federal Government that seize authority from  The rule violates the Alaska constitution and two laws that were passed by Congress in the form of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and the Alaska Statehood People throughout the country oppose this misguided rule that harms the State of Alaska's authority to manage fish and wildlife within its borders.  In my home State of Arizona, 21 different sportsmen's groups have come out publicly against the rule and endorsed Representative Young's bill to overturn this Washington power grab. The 21 Arizona sportsmen's groups include:  Anglers United; Arizona Flycasters; Arizona Sportsmen for Wildlife Conservation; Arizona Antelope Foundation, Arizona B.A.S.Nation; Arizona Big Game Super Raffle; Arizona Bowhunters Association; Arizona Catfish Conservation Association; Arizona Chapter of National Wild Turkey Federation; Arizona Council of Trout Unlimited; Arizona Deer Association; Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society; Arizona Elk Society; Arizona Houndsmen Association; Arizona Outdoor Sports; Coconino Sportsmen; Outdoor Experience for All; Shake Rattle and Troll Outdoors; the Bass Federation-AZ; Xtreme Predator Callers; and 1.2.3. Representative Don Young's bill is also supported by 27 different sportsmen and conservation groups throughout the country. The National Rifle Association, who is key voting in support of Representative Young's bill, stated:       The sustainable management of these natural resources needs      to be led by the State working in cooperation with the Fish      and Wildlife The Fish and Wildlife Service's final      rule would set an ill-advised national precedent that could      have far-reaching negative implications on the lower 48[[Page H1264]]     H.69 will restore the jurisdictional State-     Federal relationship as Congress has previously directed.

216,topic-id,2752,"Mr.President, today I come to the floor to address my colleagues about the bipartisan resolution of disapproval that I introduced on January 30, along with Senator Crapo and 24 other cosponsors. This resolution now has 32 cosponsors, and of course this resolution of disapproval is absolutely necessary.  The resolution of disapproval is a procedure, as we know, under the Congressional Review Act for repealing executive branch regulations. The regulation at issue here in this disapproval resolution was issued by the Social Security Administration under President This regulation unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. If the regulation is not repealed, it will allow the agency to very unfairly deprive Social Security recipients of their Second Amendment rights. The regulation would result in disability recipients being reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System as ineligible to own a firearm and, thus, have their Second Amendment rights violated.  This is essentially a national gun ban list. The agency accomplishes this by doing two things: determining if a person has a disorder on a vague ``mental disorders'' list, and, two, appointing a representative payee to manage benefit payments.  This process has been in place for years to merely assign a representative payee. That is merely someone who is authorized to deal with the bureaucracy on behalf of that Social Security recipient to help a recipient with their finances. Now it is being used to report beneficiaries to a list so that they cannot buy or own a gun. Of course, once on that list, individuals are prohibited, as I have already inferred, from purchasing, owning, and possessing firearms, thus violating Second Amendment rights.  The regulation is flawed beyond any kind of repair. It results in reporting[[Page S1143]]people to the gun ban list that should not be on that list at all. It deprives those people of their constitutional rights and, in a very important way, violates their constitutional rights without even due process.  Under current Federal law, one must first be deemed ``mentally defective'' before being reported to the gun ban list. However, the mental disorder list in this regulation is filled with vague characteristics that do not fit into the Federal ``mentally defective'' standard.  The disorder list is inconsistent with the Federal mentally defective standard. More importantly, the list was never designed to regulate firearms. As such, it is improper to use it for that purpose.  Many of the disorders on the list are unrelated to gun safety. For example, the disorders list includes eating disorders, disorders that merely impact sleep or cause restlessness, and even disorders that could cause ``feelings of inadequacy.''  Because the Second Amendment is a fundamental right, the government must have a very compelling reason to regulate, and the regulation must be very narrowly tailored. It unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. The government is essentially saying that a person with a disability, such as an eating disorder, is more likely to be violent and should no longer be allowed to own a gun.  There is no evidence to support that general idea and, consequently, people being denied constitutional rights without due process. And if a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it. It is pretty basic constitutional law: The government should have to carry the burden before denying a constitutional right.  The National Council on Disability--and that happens to be a nonpartisan and independent Federal agency--has said this:       The rule stigmatizes a group of people who are not likely      to perpetuate the kind of violence the rule hopes to address.      Furthermore, it deprives a much broader class of individuals      of a constitutional right than was intended by Federal law.  In addition, the American Civil Liberties Union has said:       We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the      harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a      vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent. There is no      data to support a connection between the need for a      representative payee . . . and a propensity toward gun      violence.  That was a quote from the American Civil Liberties  The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities--and that is a coalition of 100 national disability groups--shares the same concerns about regulations, and I will quote from them:       The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate      stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent      and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of      policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those      unfounded assumptions.  In other words, those unfounded assumptions are about who might be disabled or not.  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Council on Disability,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, U.House of Representatives,          Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: I write on      behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding      the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA)      released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of      the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In      accordance with our mandate to advise the President,      Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,      programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with      disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed      rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned      against implementation of the proposed rule because:       ``[t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to      manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own,      possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only      unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with      disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the      stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a      representative payee[.]''       Despite our objections and that of many other individuals      and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed      rule, the final rule released in late December was largely      unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional      right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule      legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing      the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule.       NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no      stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control      other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun      possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual      disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to      whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to      themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.      Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction      on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only      after the individual has been afforded due process and given      an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not      able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her      disability. NCD believes that SSA's final rule falls far      short of meeting these criteria.       Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on      the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of      SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule--assuming      it would be possible to do so--given the long-standing issues      SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and      difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to      beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule      creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long      noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do      the important work it is already charged with doing. With all      due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply      a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to      implement this rule may strain the already scarce      administrative resources available to the agency, further      impairing its ability to carry out its core mission.       The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory      overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In      this particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of      people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their      basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that      utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only      warranted, but necessary.

Vote YES on the Resolution of Disapproval, S.14          (Social Security Administration NICS Final Rule).     Vote NO on the Resolution of Disapproval, S.12          (Federal Acquisition Regulation/Fair Pay and Safe          Workplaces EO).       Dear Senators: On behalf of the American Civil Liberties      Union (ACLU), we urge members of the Senate to support the      resolution disapproving the final rule of the Social Security      Administration which implements the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007.       Additionally we urge members to oppose the resolution of      disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of      Defense, the General Services Administration, and NASA      relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that implement      the Fair Pay and Safe Workplace Executive Order 13673.   Social Security Administration (SSA)'s Implementation of the NICS    Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007 Harms People with Disabilities       In December 2016, the SSA promulgated a final rule that      would require the names of all Social Security Disability      Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)      benefit recipients--who, because of a mental impairment, use      a representative payee to help manage their benefits--be      submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check      System (NICS), which is used during gun purchases.       We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the      harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a      vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent and should      not own a gun. There is no data to support a connection      between the need for a representative payee to manage one's      Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward      gun violence. The rule further demonstrates the damaging      phenomenon of ``spread,'' or the perception that a disabled      individual with one area of impairment automatically has      additional, negative and unrelated attributes. Here, the rule      automatically conflates one disability-related      characteristic, that is, difficulty managing money, with the      inability to safely possess a firearm.       The rule includes no meaningful due process protections      prior to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      The determination by SSA line staff that a beneficiary needs      a representative payee to manage their money benefit is      simply not an ``adjudication'' in any ordinary meaning of the      word. Nor is it a determination that the person ``lacks the      mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs'' as      required[[Page S1144]]     by the Indeed, the law and the SSA clearly state that      representative payees are appointed for many individuals who      are legally competent.       We recognize that enacting new regulations relating to      firearms can raise difficult questions. The ACLU believes      that the right to own and use guns is not absolute or free      from government regulation, since firearms are inherently      dangerous instrumentalities and their use, unlike other      activities protected by the Bill of Rights, can inflict      serious bodily injury or death. Therefore, firearms are      subject to reasonable regulation in the interests of public      safety, crime prevention, maintaining the peace,      environmental protection, and public health. We do not oppose      regulation of firearms as long as it is reasonably related to      these legitimate government interests.       At the same time, regulation of firearms and individual gun      ownership or use must be consistent with civil liberties      principles, such as due process, equal protection, freedom      from unlawful searches, and privacy. All individuals have the      right to be judged on the basis of their individual      capabilities, not the characteristics and capabilities that      are sometimes attributed (often mistakenly) to any group or      class to which they belong. A disability should not      constitute grounds for the automatic per se denial of any      right or privilege, including gun ownership.  Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Regulations Advance Worker Safety and                                  Rights       The rules implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces      Executive Order take an important step towards creating more      equitable and safe work conditions by ensuring that federal      contractors provide workplaces that comply with federal labor      and civil rights laws.       Employers that have the privilege of doing business with      the federal government must meet their legal obligations. The      Fair Pay and Safe Workplace regulations are crucial because      they help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly      and ethically with respect to labor standards and civil      rights laws and that they are complying with federal labor      and employment laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act      (which includes the Equal Pay Act), Title VII of the Civil      Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and      the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and their state law      equivalents. The Executive Order also bans contractors from      forcing employees to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the      Civil Rights Act as well as claims of sexual harassment and      sexual assault.       Congress should stand with workers, increase the      accountability of federal contractors and oppose any attempts      to undo the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations. These      rules will help ensure that the federal government does not      contract with employers that routinely violate workplace      health and safety protections, engage in age, disability,      race, and sex discrimination, withhold wages, or commit other      labor violations.

The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the      largest coalition of national organizations working together      to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self-     determination, independence, empowerment, integration and      inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all      aspects of society.       Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights      Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a      letter to the Obama Administration and through the public      comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--opposed      the rule for a number of reasons, including:       The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy      change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive      assistance from representative payees in managing their      benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public      dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people      with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there      is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed      by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.       The absence of any data suggesting that there is any      connection between the need for a representative payee to      manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a      propensity toward gun violence.       The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior      to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to      transmit the names of individuals who have been      ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own      affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication      and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly      unable to manage their own affairs.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability, an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies      regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the      Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.       We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to      disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it      inflicts on the disability community.       On behalf of the CCD Rights Task Force, the undersigned Co-     Chairs,     Dara Baldwin,       National Disability Rights     Samantha Crane,       Autistic Self-Advocacy     Sandy Finucane,       Epilepsy Foundation     Jennifer Mathis,       Bazelon Center for Mental     Mark Richert,       American Foundation for the  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1142-3.txt,457,PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS,2017.0,14.0,February
217,topic-id,1022,"Mr.President, some of the supporters of the new gun ban have brought forth arguments to try to discredit the other side. They have said that repealing the agency rule will allow the mentally ill to acquire firearms.  Let me tell you why that is not true. Under this regulation, the Social Security Administration never, ever determines a person to be mentally ill before reporting them to this gun ban list. It does not provide due process before reporting them to the list. Once the agency places a person on this disorders list, it then moves to assign a representative payee. But that is a very flawed process as well.  The former Social Security Administration inspector general said the following last year in testimony before a committee about assigning a representative payee. This will be a very short quote from the inspector general: ``It's not a scientific decision; it's more of a personal opinion.''  It is quite obvious under our Constitution's due process clause that the personal opinion of a bureaucrat cannot be the basis for taking away a person's Second Amendment rights.  Further, a June 2015 internal Social Security report found significant shortcomings in the representative payee process, namely that--and I will quote from the Social Security report--``the Social Security Administration's capability determinations were undeveloped, undocumented, or insufficiently documented.''  A very legitimate question can be raised: How can any of us be comfortable allowing our fellow citizens to be subjected to such a process, a process that leads to the violation of constitutional rights? The regulation does not then require a formal hearing at any point.  Federal law and other regulations require that a formal hearing take place.  Mr.President, 18 U.S.922(d)(4) requires adjudication before depriving someone of the right to own a firearm due to mental illness. There can be no adjudication if there is no hearing.  A 1996 ATF Federal Register Notice says ``the legislative history of the Gun Control Act makes it clear that a formal adjudication is necessary before firearms disabilities are incurred.''  The Obama administration knew that fundamental rights required constitutional due process. At the bare minimum, that requires a hearing. Yet, in this rule, no hearing is being afforded to that individual that will eventually have their constitutional rights abrogated. Of course, that ought to be considered not only a travesty but a travesty on the Constitution as[[Page S1145]]well. The constitutional due process is entirely nonexistent because there is absolutely no opportunity for an individual to challenge the proceedings against them.  The American Civil Liberties Union has echoed the same concerns, stating that ``the rule includes no meaningful due process protections prior to the Social Security Administration's transmittal of the names to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database.''  The Second Amendment is very much being tossed aside without a formal dispute process to challenge the action before the constitutional right is abridged. On these facts alone, the regulation should be repealed. Yet there is more.  The regulation fails to establish that a person is a danger to themselves or a danger to others before taking away the constitutional rights the Second Amendment allows. If a rule premised on safety is to have any credibility, one would obviously think that the government needs to prove a person is dangerous, but this rule fails in that regard because it does not require the agency to find a person is, in fact, dangerous. The Second Amendment is a fundamental right requiring the government to carry the burden showing a person has a dangerous mental illness. This regulation obviously and simply does not achieve that requirement.  To be clear, however, if this regulation is repealed, Federal gun prohibitions will still exist. Individuals who have been determined to be a danger to themselves or others will still be prohibited from purchasing firearms. Also, individuals who are found to have a dangerous mental illness will be prohibited from purchasing a firearm. A person convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence will still be prohibited from purchasing, owning, and possessing a firearm. The same is true for those involuntarily committed to a mental institution.  As government expands, liberty contracts. It follows that with the expansion of government, power is centralized here, in this island surrounded by reality that we call Washington, DC, rather than with the American people. Often with that centralization of power, fairness does not necessarily follow, as demonstrated by this regulation. This Obama-era regulation is a perfect example of government wielding too much power--the power to deny people due process, the power to deny people their constitutional rights under the Second  The process described herein is extremely problematic and necessitates being done away with by the passing of this resolution of disapproval. It is not clear that any of these disorders a person is labeled with has anything whatsoever to do with a person's ability to responsibly own a firearm, and there is insufficient due process to ensure that a person actually has a given disorder that would interfere with their safe use of a firearm. Notably, even if a representative payee has been assigned, the individual still maintains the capacity to contract.  Thus, the government is subject to a very low threshold to report names to the gun list and no burden of proof is required. By contrast, under this regulation, those who are reported to the list must prove the negative. They have to prove that the government is wrong. They must prove they are not a danger in order to get their name off that gun ban list. For the government to shift the burden to the citizen whose rights are being deprived is clearly unfair and unconstitutional. The failure to determine if a person is mentally ill or a danger to self or others is a material defect to this regulation, as is the failure to afford constitutional due process. There is no reasonable basis under this regulation to justify abridging that very important, fundamental constitutional right, and that is why this regulation must be repealed through the passage of this resolution of disapproval.  I yield the floor.                            Order for Recess  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1142-3.txt,457,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,14.0,February

234,topic-id,688,"Mr.President, we have a very bad regulation that has been put out by the Social Security Administration that needs to be obliterated, so we are using a process called the Congressional Review Act to show Congress's displeasure with the Social Security Administration and to get this regulation off the books.  Now, there has been a lot of talk about how the Congressional Review Act is the wrong vehicle to repeal the disastrous regulation. So I want to quote a contrary opinion from the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery saying this:       The CRA--  Meaning the Congressional Review Act--     is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory overreach,      and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In this      particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of      people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their      basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that      utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only      warranted, but necessary.  I would add to it that it is obviously necessary.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            National Coalition for                                       Mental Health Recovery,                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      I write on behalf of the National Coalition for Mental Health      Recovery (NCMHR) regarding the final rule the Social Security      Administration (SSA) released on December 19th, 2016,      implementing provisions of the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of      2007, 81 FR 91702.       In accordance with our mandate to advise the President,      Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,      programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with      disabilities, NCMHR submitted comments to SSA on the proposed      rule. In our comments, we cautioned against implementation of      the proposed rule because there is no causal connection      between the inability to manage money and the ability to      safely and responsibly own, possess or use a firearm. This      arbitrary linkage not only unnecessarily and unreasonably      deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional      right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their      disabilities, may need a representative payee.       Despite our objections and that of many other individuals      and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed      rule, the final rule released in late December was largely      unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional      right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule      legitimizes, NCMHR recommends that Congress consider      utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this      rule.       NCMHR is a nonpartisan, is nonpartisan nonprofit with no      stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control      other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun      possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual      disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to      whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to      themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.      Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction      on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only      after the individual has been afforded due process and given      an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not      able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her      disability. NCMHR believes that SSA's final rule falls far      short of meeting these criteria.       The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory      overreach, and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously.      In this particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the[[Page S1154]]     essential mission of an agency that millions of people with      and without disabilities rely upon to meet their basic needs.      Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that utilizing the      CRA to repeal the final rule is not only warranted, but      necessary.

235,topic-id,1539,"Mr.President, there has also been talk about how supposedly dangerous it will be if this Social Security regulation is terminated. I don't see how that can possibly be realistic if the Social Security Administration doesn't even determine whether a person is dangerous in the first place--and ``dangerous'' meaning in regard to whether or not they ought to be able to make use of the constitutional right of the Second Amendment to own and possess firearms.  Others in this debate continue to mention that mentally ill people will be able to acquire firearms. Now this is very important. The Social Security Administration does not determine a person to be mentally ill prior to reporting their names to the gun ban list, and being on the list denies you your constitutional rights. The agency has confirmed this in writing to my office:       Yes, you are correct. The Social Security Administration      does not diagnose individuals as mentally ill.  Supporters of this gun ban failed to address why individuals are not provided formal due process before reporting their name to the list. Supporters have also failed to talk about how the regulation is inconsistent with the statutory standard of ``mental defective.''  An existing statute requires agencies to report individuals to the gun ban list who are ineligible under current law for possessing firearms. That requirement does not require the existence of any regulation to be effective. So it is plainly wrong to claim, as was said this very day by the people opposed to what we are doing, that if the regulation is disapproved, agencies will no longer have to report prohibited persons. The reverse, in fact, is true.  The regulation usurps unlawful authority to report people to the gun ban list who are not barred from owning guns under current law and that the agency is prohibited from reporting under current law, especially without the adjudication that is required under current law.  Opponents of the regulation base their opposition on the language of the regulation, existing law, and the Constitution, citing the Constitution to say that you don't have a constitutional right to own arms under the Second Amendment, which is contrary to two recent Supreme Court decisions that verify that that applies to an individual. That is why the regulation's supporters must resort to arguments that lack legal and factual foundation.  Supporters of this gun ban also fail to address how overly broad this regulation is, as written. It will capture innocent Americans, denying innocent Americans their constitutional rights. Sadly, then, we know how this will play out if this regulation were allowed to go forward because we have the example of the Department of Veterans Affairs reporting hundreds of thousands of veterans to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System without adequate due process. That is the same system that Social Security was going to report people to.  Veterans were reported just because some lonely bureaucrat wanted to report them, with no opportunity to first have a neutral authority hold a hearing, finding that that individual is dangerous or actually has a dangerous condition. These were veterans who needed financial help managing their benefit payments.  It is common sense that needing help with your finances should not mean that you have surrendered a fundamental constitutional right of self-defense that you have under the Second  Just like the Social Security Administration, the VA does not determine whether a veteran is dangerous before reporting his name to the gun ban list and denying that veteran his Second Amendment constitutional rights to own and possess firearms. The VA regulation is eerily similar to what the Social Security Administration wants to do.  On May 17, 2016, Senator Durbin and I debated my amendment that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to first find veterans to be a danger before reporting their names to the gun ban list. Now that is common sense; isn't it? You ought to find out if they are really dangerous before they are denied a constitutional right.  During the course of that debate, Senator Durbin admitted that the list was broader than it should have been. He said:       I do not dispute what the Senator from Iowa suggested, that      some of these veterans may be suffering from a mental illness      not serious enough to disqualify them from owning a firearm,      but certainly many of them do.  Senator Durbin also said:       Let me just concede at the outset, reporting 174,000 names      goes too far, but eliminating--  As my legislation proposed to do--     174,000 names goes too far.  For the record, though, it wasn't really 174,000 names going too far. It was actually 260,381 names that the VA sent to the gun ban list. Now that happens to be 98.8 percent of all names that are in the alleged ``mental defective'' category.  The Department of Veterans Affairs reported more names by far than any other agency without sufficient justification. Senator Durbin's staff and mine have met over these issues since that debate, and I appreciate and thank him for that outreach.  Now we have the Social Security Administration problem and, through the Congressional Review Act, we can do something about it. We don't have to pass a separate piece of legislation, like we are going to have to do to straighten out the So the Social Security Administration is about to make the same mistake as the VA unless we stop it right here and right now.  If this regulation is not repealed, the agency has informed my staff that approximately 15,000 to 75,000 beneficiaries of Social Security may be reported annually, denying them their constitutional right to bear, possess, and own firearms. That figure of 15,000 or even more so--the higher figure of 75,000--will add up very quickly.  In my earlier speech today on this topic, I made clear that the agency regulation is defective in many ways; namely, the regulation does not require the agency to find a person dangerous or mentally ill. The regulation provides no formal hearing before a person is reported to the gun ban list.  Supporters have also said that repeal of this regulation will interfere with enforcement of gun prohibition laws. Such a position is without any merit--denying people constitutional due process.  As I made clear in my earlier speech, important Federal gun laws are still on the books, even if the agency rule is repealed. This is so because this new regulation is actually inconsistent with those existing Federal gun laws. For example, individuals who have been determined to be dangerous or mentally ill will be prohibited, as will those convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and the same for those involuntarily committed to mental institutions.  While discussing the faults and defects of the rule, I think it is important to highlight that the issues I have pointed out are also the solution to the problem. If the supporters of the agency rule want the Social Security Administration to report individuals to the gun ban list, changes need to be made. Individuals must first be determined by a neutral authority after a fair hearing meeting the requirements of the U.If they are dangerous and have a dangerous mental illness, then they could constitutionally be denied that right. Constitutional due process is a very important part of that process.  If we do not act, the agency will erroneously report tens of thousands of people per year to the gun ban list, and not one of them will have been adjudicated to be dangerous after a hearing with due process, not one of them will have been adjudicated to be mentally ill after a hearing with due process, and all of them will have had the government's burden shifted to them to prove they are not dangerous in order to get their name off the gun ban list. It is common sense, isn't it? It ought to be that you are innocent until proven guilty. If you can't have a gun, common sense tells me you ought not have[[Page S1155]]to prove that you can have a gun to the government; the government has to prove that you should not have a gun.  Any way you look at it, the regulatory scheme is patently unfair. If the government wants to regulate firearms, it needs to produce a clearly defined regulation that is very narrowly tailored to identify individuals who are actually dangerous and who actually have a dangerous mental illness. The government must also afford constitutional due process.  What we are dealing with here is a fundamental constitutional right backed up by two Supreme Court decisions in the last 10 years. With that type of constitutional status, the Second Amendment requires greater effort and greater precision from the government in order to fairly regulate how the American people exercise that constitutional right. This regulation simply doesn't meet that standard.  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of disapproval.  Mr.President, I don't know whether anybody else is coming to seek the floor. If I am infringing upon somebody else's time, I will yield the floor, but in the meantime, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1149-2.txt,457,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 66, DISAPPROVING RULE",2017.0,14.0,February
236,topic-id,1017,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss some criticism I have heard about the nominee to fill the seat on the Supreme That nominee is Neil  My colleague, the minority leader, met with the nominee last week. Afterward, he told reporters that he had ``serious, serious concerns'' about the judge. Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised--after all, it seems the minority leader had concerns about the nominee even before the nominee was announced.  Before Judge Gorsuch was announced, the minority leader made clear that any nominee must be ``mainstream.'' But it became clear immediately that this nominee is widely regarded as a mainstream judge with impeccable credentials. Liberal law professor Laurence Tribe says that ``he's a brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work with distinction.'' Alan Dershowitz, who certainly is no conservative, says that Judge Gorsuch will be ``hard to oppose on the merits.'' Even President Obama's Acting Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, said Judge Gorsuch ``would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.'' The chorus goes on.  Apparently, because the nominee is so obviously mainstream, the benchmark for my colleague's concerns keeps changing. The minority leader has conveniently developed a new test. Now he says the benchmark is independence: ``The bar for the Supreme Court nominee to prove that they can be independent, has never, never been higher.''  Well, fortunately for the minority leader, Judge Gorsuch passes that bar with flying colors, just like he passed the ``mainstream'' test with flying colors. The nominee's record makes clear that he is an independent and fairminded judge who is deeply committed to the separation of powers.  Here is just one example from his many opinions on this point. Just last year, Judge Gorsuch had to decide a case about the authority of the Board of Immigration Appeals, or the BIA, which answers to the Attorney The BIA wanted to change the Attorney General's power to waive immigration requirements for illegal immigrants, and it wanted the new rules to apply to undocumented immigrants whose waiver applications were already in the works. The nominee said no to this executive agency. To be clear, Judge Gorsuch was asked to decide whether an executive agency in charge of immigration laws could change the law on a whim in a way that many believed was unfair to immigrants who had already sought waivers. He said no.  With due respect to my friend the minority leader, there is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch would say no to this or any other part of the executive branch that oversteps its bounds.  Here is what the nominee wrote about the separation of powers and executive branch overreach. For him to defer to the executive agency in that case would be ``more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design.'' That is because doing so would allow agency bureaucracy to ``swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power,'' which the Constitution assigns to separate branches of government. So the nominee was concerned about the separation of powers. He was concerned about people whose liberties might be impaired, and because of those concerns, he said no to the immigration agency's policy whim of the day.  Judge Michael McConnell, a former colleague of Judge Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit, makes the same observation about this case. He says the scope of executive power arguably ``will be the most common Supreme Court issue of the coming decade.'' He says the nominee analyzes that issue in a way that is faithful to the Constitution and to the independence of the judiciary, and he points to the nominee's thinking on this question. Judge Gorsuch wrote:       What would happen . . . if the political majorities who run      the legislative and executive branches could decide cases and      controversies over past facts? They might be tempted to bend      existing laws, to reinterpret them . . . [this would] risk      the possibility that unpopular groups might be singled out      for this sort of mistreatment--and [would] rais[e] along the      way, too, grave due process, fair notice, and equal      protection problems. . . . It was to avoid dangers like      these, dangers the founders had studied and seen realized in      their own time, that they pursued the separation of powers.  That is the writing of an independent judge who believes in the separation of powers.  You know, there is a bit of irony to some of the criticism I have heard leveled against Judge On the one hand, I have heard that he will have to be independent and that he won't rubberstamp the President's agenda. On the other hand, I have heard that he will be way too tough on the executive branch as it fulfills the President's agenda. It is quite obvious that, common sense tells us as we look at those two arguments that we can't have it both ways.  Judge Gorsuch has shown he is faithful to the separation of powers in the That means he will be an independent judge who will say no when the other branches of government overreach.  You don't need to take my word for it. Listen to President Obama's Acting Solicitor General, Neal He is no fan of the President's Executive order, but he says that Judge Gorsuch ``will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him.'' Instead, the Solicitor General said the nominee ``would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.''  Judge Gorsuch's record and reputation leave no room to doubt that he is a mainstream, independent judge. He will apply the law fairly, and he won't be afraid to say no when the Constitution requires it.  Every time my colleague the minority leader has set out a standard for filling this Supreme Court seat, this judge has met it. He is mainstream. He is independent. And when my colleague chooses a new standard, I bet the nominee will also meet that new standard.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

528,topic-id,575,"Mr.President, before we vote on the resolution of disapproval, I want to reiterate several very important facts.  This resolution of disapproval is bipartisan. The resolution is also supported by 23 groups, mostly disability rights groups.  The disability groups believe that this agency--the Social Security Administration--and its regulation will unfairly stigmatize those with disabilities. Of course, they are right.  The American Civil Liberties Union has said this:       We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the      harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a      vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent and should      not own a gun. There is no data to support a connection      between the need for a representative payee to manage one's      Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward      gun violence.  The ACLU goes on to say:       Here, the rule automatically conflates one's disability-     related characteristic, that is, difficulty managing money,      with the inability to safely possess a firearm.  The agency regulation is defective in many ways. Namely, the regulation does not require the agency to prove a person is dangerous or mentally ill. The regulation also provides no formal hearing or due process before a person is reported to the gun ban list.  Supporters of the gun ban have said that repeal of this regulation will interfere with the enforcement of the gun prohibition laws. I want to say plainly and simply: This is hogwash. We should not let baseless scare tactics confuse this important issue.  Important Federal gun laws are still on the books, even if the agency rule is repealed. We aren't repealing any laws.  The new regulation is inconsistent with these existing Federal gun laws.  The agency still has a duty to report anyone who has actually been adjudicated as dangerously mentally ill to the gun ban list. That is also true of anyone convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence or involuntarily committed to a mental institution.  The Federal law requires this:       If a Federal department or agency . . . has any record of      any person demonstrating that the person falls within one of      the categories . . . shall . . . provide the pertinent      information contained in such record to the Attorney  This law remains in effect.  Repealing this regulation will merely ensure that disabled citizens' Second Amendment rights are, in fact, protected.  Those rights will no longer be able to be revoked without a hearing and without due process. It will take more than a personal opinion--just a personal opinion of a bureaucrat--to abridge one's Second Amendment rights.  An existing statute requires agencies to report the individuals to the gun ban list who are ineligible to possess firearms. That requirement remains intact even if this regulation is repealed.  So it is plainly wrong to claim, as has been said, that if the regulation is disapproved, agencies will no longer have to report prohibited persons.  If the supporters of this regulation want to take away people's gun rights, then they need to acknowledge the government must carry the burden to actually prove a person--prove a person--is dangerously mentally ill. And the government must provide due process in that process.  They need to go back to the drawing board, in other words, because this rule is inconsistent with the very important Second Amendment rights to bear arms, own, and possess guns--buy and possess guns. Therefore, it must be repealed, and this resolution must be approved.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1167-2.txt,457,PUT AMERICA FIRST INSTEAD OF THE KREMLIN,2017.0,15.0,February

The massive Federal overreach and trampling of states' rights being claimed by the sponsor of this resolution and its supporters is nothing more than the latest statement of alternative facts by Republicans here in The truth is both the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act authorize--and, in fact, require--the Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain the natural diversity of refuges in Alaska, regardless of State wildlife laws. This includes protecting healthy populations of apex predators like wolves and bears.  Instead, the rule prevents the use of methods that hunters in our own country agree violate the ``fair chase'' ethical standard that separates sports hunting from pleasure killing. I don't hunt, but no hunter that I know would ever think of catching a bear in a steel trap or luring it in with bait and then shooting it or blowing away a mother wolf and her pups in their den. These are the types of practices this rule bans, and it only prohibits them on national wildlife refuge areas that are owned and maintained by the American people, not the State of These tactics are not part of any science-based wildlife management strategy, and despite what Trump's new Education Secretary might think, these measures are not necessary to protect schoolchildren from grizzlies.  This resolution is just another piece of the Republican agenda to hand our public lands over to States and private interests as well as a distraction from the things House Republicans aren't doing.  Where is your infrastructure package?  Where is your solution to make technical education and college more affordable?  Where is your plan to combat climate change?  The answer is that they do not exist. So, instead, we are wasting time on yet another Congressional Review Act resolution, standing idly by without putting people to work fixing our roads, bridges, and energy grid; without training Americans to do the job of today's economy, not to mention tomorrow's; and without lifting a finger to protect people, many of whom are our own constituents, from the worst impacts of global warming.  The only difference between Trump and the House Republicans is that he distracts the public to try to move his agenda, and they distract the public to hide the fact that they can't move theirs. I urge you to stop the distractions and vote ``no'' on this resolution.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1259-7.txt,1708,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 43, PROVIDING FOR",2017.0,16.0,February

99,topic-id,918,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, Federal ownership of the land along the Red River dates back to the Louisiana Over time, gradual changes in the course of the river have created uncertainty regarding Federal interests in the area as well as confusion about the exact boundary between Texas and Further complicating the matter, Native American Tribes have mineral and other interests in the area impacted by the precise ownership of the land in question.  In fact, as noted in the Supreme Court case of Oklahoma v. Texas, a 1923 case, the decision was the boundaries were changed due to accretion and erosion. It is important to note that the gentleman from Texas does not dispute the criteria set forth by the Supreme Court in Oklahoma v. Moreover, in 2000, Congress passed the Red River Boundary Compact, which shifted the boundary line between the States, but the location and status of lands in the public domain remain unchanged. Along the 116-mile stretch, a portion of the land in the Red River area is still under Federal ownership because it has never been disposed of under the authority of  In 2013, the Bureau of Land Management set out to revise the Federal resource management plan for Federal lands--not private lands, Federal lands--in Oklahoma, Kansas, and As part of that process, the BLM began to survey the lands to determine the extent of all ownership claims. According to the 2014 testimony from the Deputy Director of the BLM, Steve Ellis, the survey process the BLM intends ``to identify, with certainty, and propose management alternatives for lands which fall within the public domain but have never been patented, reserved, or disposed.''  According to that same testimony, the BLM estimates that approximately 30,000 acres of public land exist along the Red River between the north fork of the river and the 98th meridian. They also estimate that as many as 23,000 of those acres may be overlaid by private ownership interests.  One of the most significant and advantageous parts about the process for updating land use plans is that it includes steps along the way that allow for public input, analysis, and informed decisionmaking.  Once the survey is complete, the BLM has a variety of statutory authorities the agency can use to resolve conflicting claims, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Color of Title  H.428, the bill before us today, has a troubled history. Flaws in the bill have prevented it from becoming law for several years. Some of those shortcomings have been addressed, but others remain.  H.428 would halt the planning and survey process in its tracks. The bill would strip the Bureau of Land Management of its survey authority along the 116-mile stretch of the Red River, and it would force the Federal Government to accept the survey completed by the States of Texas and  Prohibiting the Federal Government from surveying its own land is unprecedented and unwarranted. What is also troubling is that, in stark violation of Republican policy against authorizations without an offset, this legislation authorizes the expenditure of $1 million in Federal funding to pay the States to complete the survey.  It is important to note that allowing State governments to dictate the outcome of this process is a terrible precedent, and forcing the American taxpayers to pay the States for those surveys adds insult to injury.                              {time}  1515  Parts of this case are currently in the Federal court of the U.District Court for the Northern District of The parties include the State of Texas, BLM, and plaintiff landowners; and they are in mediation working to resolve these very complicated issues.

101,topic-id,789,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I think it is very important for us--though they have made light of the fact that this has a history, beginning with the Louisiana Purchase--that this is not a new issue. There are a series of subsequent treaties with foreign governments in 1819, 1828, and 1838, which set the south bank of the river as the southern border of the United States and the northern border of what is now the State of  In 1867, when a portion of this public domain was reserved for the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache (KCA) Reservation, the middle of the main channel of the river between the 98th meridian and the north fork of the river was established as the reservation's southern boundary. The remaining land between what is now called the medial line and the southern bank retained its status as public land, which continues through the present.  In a series of decisions in the 1920s, the U.Supreme Court adopted a method known as the gradient boundary method for determining the location of the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma along the southern bank of the river. In giving certainty to the boundary's location and the extent of tribal holdings, the Court's decision also provided a basis for clarifying private land ownership on each side of the river.  In 1981 and 1984, two separate Oklahoma landowners argued in the United States District Court that, under riparian law, changes in the river's location had expanded their private holdings while reducing the acreage of the Texas landowners whose properties faced them across the river. In both cases, the district court followed the Supreme Court's established principle concerning the location of public and private lands.  Private property in Oklahoma extended to the center of the river while private property in Texas stopped at the ordinary high-water mark on the southern bank, with the remaining land being part of the original public domain located in  In 2000, the State legislatures of Oklahoma and Texas, along with tribal leaders from the neighboring KCA Tribes and Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations, attempted to resolve these remaining issues by agreeing to the Red River Boundary Congress later consented to the compact, and, in so doing, agreed to move the jurisdictional boundary between the States from the south bank gradient line to the south bank vegetation line.  The BLM began updating its resource management plan for public lands in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, which includes the area along the Red River, in 2013. The BLM doesn't full know the extent of public domain, and that is why they are trying to do the survey. The resource management planning process would update the current RMPs covering this area, which were developed in 1994 and 1996, and establish a long-term plan articulating the BLM's objectives and strategies for maintaining the health and productivity of public lands in the region.  As we discussed earlier, in 1923, the United States Supreme Court also interjected into this and set the criteria.  We can disagree on some of these issues, but we can at least agree to get[[Page H1157]]our facts straight. We do know, Mr.Speaker, that this has been an ongoing process and this has gone back for different administrations.  I think the question becomes: Why is it necessary to do this now? What is it that is happening now? They are in court. They have been in court. They have availed themselves of the court process. No one disagrees with the United States Supreme Court decision.  So the question we should all ask ourselves is: Why now? Why take out, in this bill, my amendment that was rejected by the Rules Committee which would have eliminated that portion which says basically the Federal Government has no say in the survey? So why would we abdicate that major responsibility?  We not only have responsibility to the tribes listed, but there are also different kinds of tribal lands, which we must take into account. So the question is: Why abdicate it?  If as was stated earlier that what we are talking about is just a bill that says to the BLM to do the survey, then why does it contain within it a statement that says it has no right to concur or to approve?  I think that it would be a different situation if this was a bill that said: hurry up and do your survey. But that is not what this bill says.  This bill says the States of Texas and Oklahoma will do it--actually, Texas will do it in consultation with Oklahoma and specific tribes.  Why doesn't it say, if what we want is a survey, that BLM do the survey?  I reserve the balance of my time.

102,topic-id,472,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It is very interesting because we seem to be confusing what is at issue here. If what is at issue here is a survey process, then there is no question. The survey process is set up in the United States Supreme Court decision of Oklahoma v. No one disputes that that should be it.  Neither is it disputed that BLM cannot illegally claim private property and, in fact, it does have a process by which it can sell that private property.  First, under Section 203 of FLPMA, the BLM may sell public lands for private fair market value if, through the planning process, the public land has been determined to be difficult and uneconomic to manage; the land was acquired for a specific purpose but no longer fulfills the Federal purpose; or disposal may serve important public objectives which cannot be achieved prudently on land other than public land.  Under Section 206 of the FLPMA, the Secretary of the Interior can also conduct land exchanges of equal value with the same State so long as the public interest is well served.  Mr.Speaker, the reason why there is a compact of 2000 on this specific issue is because the States can't do it without the concurrence of What is being proposed here, in terms of the survey, is really using a Federal standard.  Again, the question is: Why?  More importantly, Mr.Speaker, there are tribal lands involved; not only the tribes noted, but also different types of tribal lands, private tribal lands different from that which is held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior, and we are abdicating that responsibility.  We have a fiduciary duty to these tribal lands, and it should not be treated basically with, well, if we don't agree, maybe we can come forward and say we don't agree. That is not what this is about.  They are beginning the process. They are in mediation. The courts have been the mechanism by which landowners have views, and there is one going on. So why not let the process go?  It just seems to be out of Congress' authority to simply abdicate the responsibilities that we have and say: The States can do it. And then we pay for it. Now, that makes no sense.  We need to be able to say to those that we have a fiduciary obligation to, and others, that we have done our job; that the Federal Government has done its job.  They are in the process. So the question I have again is, why now? Why now? This has been going on since way--I read through all the different treaties and the different types of cases that came up since 1923, Oklahoma v. So why now?

In the year 2000, when the Red River Compact was approved by Congress, and because of the nature of a compact and because of the requirements of our United States Constitution, which I know my colleagues abide by, it is a different situation. This could have been addressed if they wanted it addressed, but that is not what was done.  It is not over 100 years. We have intervening facts, like the compact of 2000, which afforded Congress the opportunity to look at this and, more importantly, the States the opportunity to decide.  Now, what did they do?  They disagreed on the high-water mark. They did not go into these specific issues. I am sure it is not something that occurred within the last 17 years. This is something that existed all along. So I call everyone's attention to the compact of 2000.  Last year's bill, H.2130, contained in there the following statements: The Secretary disclaims any right, title, and interest to the land located south of the south bank boundary line in the affected area.  It also said that surveys conducted by the Bureau of Land Management before the date of enactment of this act shall have no force or effect in determining the south bank boundary line.  So to say that they didn't do anything--or it was being done--the law that was attempted to be passed, it passed out of the The bill that passed out of the House contains in it specific language that they are saying they don't want any of that to apply.  So, Mr.Speaker, we come back to, I guess, why? Why? The authority to survey and approve or disapprove the sale or transfer of public lands belongs to the Federal Government acting on behalf of the American people.  The Bureau of Land Management has held the authority to examine the accuracy of these surveys and make revisions, when necessary and, in this instance, an ongoing process to make changes began in 2013. It is not like nothing has happened. It has been ongoing. The BLM has the tools and authority to resolve this survey problem, and Congress should just get out of the way and allow the process to play out.  Instead, my colleagues across the aisle want to use the situation as an excuse to make progress on their larger goal, alienating public land.  Just last week, they voted to repeal the BLM's efforts to update their resource management planning process. BLM's new rule increased the opportunities for the public to engage in the management of public lands and help the agency respond more efficiently to changes taking place in the environment and across the landscape.  By repealing BLM's planning rule, Republicans are ensuring that more disputes like Red River will develop, more public land will be lost or destroyed, and more litigation will ensue, all costing taxpayers more money.  So, Mr.Speaker, when we talk about H.428, it is just the latest step in a very unpopular, anti-public lands campaign. Americans across the country have equal ownership and right to access and to enjoy all the resources. Whether it is a national park in Montana, a national park in Hawaii that has a volcano, forest lands in Pennsylvania, or wetlands in Colorado, the opportunities afforded through these resources belong to us all, regardless of hometown, education, means, or experience.  Despite the fact that we are talking about a 160-mile stretch of the Red River, by cutting away at the authority and management tools Federal agencies have at their disposal, this bill furthers my colleagues across the aisle's national public lands agenda and threatens the multiple-use principle that governs all BLM lands, all while costing the taxpayers the money.  It is like adding insult to injury. Not only do we pass a law, but we are also paying the States to do the survey.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I want to conclude by acknowledging that I have read all of the various statements and the cases about the property owners along the Red I do understand that providing them with certainty and assurance that their property rights are not threatened is a goal that many share.  However, it would be unprecedented and would only further complicate matters to transfer the Federal survey authority over public domain to the This is not the way our public lands should be managed.  There is a transparent, objective process to determine ownership along the Red This bill subverts that process and sends $1 million in Federal taxpayers' money for a State purpose. This is neither fair nor just outcome.  With the long, complicated history and various ownership claims along the Red River, BLM has to be allowed to complete its planning process and land survey. It also needs the right to have a say, which this bill, H.428, eliminates that right.  Congress should not determine the outcome of what essentially amounts to a three-way property dispute by conceding Federal authority to a BLM has its tools it needs. We just need to get out of the way and let them do their work, which they have been trying to do over the years; and we do know 2013 has begun the process.  I urge my colleagues to reject the bill.

983,topic-id,1350,"Mr.President, I rise today, humbled to offer my first official speech as the junior U.Senator from the great State of I rise with a deep sense of reverence for this institution, for its history, and for its unique role as the defender of our Nation's ideals.  Above all, I rise today with a sense of gratitude for all those upon whose shoulders we stand. For me, it starts with my mother Shyamala She arrived at the University of California, Berkeley, from India in 1959 with dreams of becoming a scientist. The plan, when she finished school, was to go back home to a traditional Indian marriage. But when she met my father Donald Harris, she made a different plan. She went against a practice reaching back thousands of years, and[[Page S1258]]instead of an arranged marriage, she chose a love marriage. This act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me, and it made us Americans, like millions of children of immigrants before and since.  I know she is looking down on us today, and knowing my mother, she is probably saying: Kamala, what on Earth is going on down there? We have to stand up for our values.  So in the spirit of my mother, who was always direct, I cannot mince words. In the early weeks of this administration, we have seen an unprecedented series of Executive actions that have hit our immigrant and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear in the hearts of millions of good, hard-working people, all by Executive fiat.  By fiat, we have seen the President stick taxpayers with a bill for a multibillion-dollar border wall, without regard to the role of the U.Congress under article 1 of the By fiat, we have seen a President mandate the detention of immigrants, both documented and undocumented, creating a dragnet that could ensnare 8 million people. By fiat, the President has ordered the creation of what essentially will be a 15,000-member deportation force. By fiat, he wants to take away State and local authority by making local police officers act as Federal immigration officials. By fiat, the President wants to slam the gates of freedom by instituting a Muslim ban--a ban which was as carelessly written as it has been incompetently enforced.  In recent days, we have seen an increased severity in immigration raids sweeping across this country, including the arrest of a DREAMer in Seattle and a domestic violence victim in And we have seen an administration violate court orders, attack the First Amendment, bully Federal judges, and mock Americans exercising their right to freely assemble.  I rise today to discuss how these actions impact my State of California and our country. In particular, the State of California, I believe, is a microcosm of who we are as In California, we have farmers and environmentalists, welders and technologists, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and the largest number of immigrants, documented and undocumented, of any State in the  I rise because the President's actions have created deep uncertainty and pain for our refugee and immigrant communities. I rise on behalf of California's more than 250,000 DREAMers, who were told by the Federal Government: If you sign up, we will not use your personal information against you. I rise to say the United States of America cannot go back on our promise to these kids and their families.  I rise today as a lifelong prosecutor and as the former top cop of the biggest State in this country to say that these Executive actions present a real threat to our public safety. Let me repeat that: The President's immigration actions and Muslim ban will make America less safe.  As a prosecutor, I can tell you it is a serious mistake to conflate criminal justice policy with immigration policy, as if they are the same thing. They are not. I have personally prosecuted everything from low-level offenses to homicides. I know what a crime looks like, and I will tell you, an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. But that is what these actions do; they suggest all immigrants are criminals and treat immigrants like criminals.  There is no question, those who commit crimes must face severe and serious and swift consequence and accountability. But the truth is, the vast majority of the immigrants in this country are hard-working people who deserve a pathway to citizenship.  Instead of making us safer, these increased raids and Executive orders instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will be deported or have to give up information resulting in the deportation of their family members. For this reason, studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 9-1-1 when they have been a victim of crime. This climate of fear drives people underground and into the shadows, making them less likely to report crimes against themselves or others--fewer victims reporting crime and fewer witnesses coming forward.  These Executive actions create a strain on local law enforcement. Any police chief in this country will tell you that they barely have enough resources to get their job done. So when you make local law enforcement do the job of the Federal Government, you strain the resources for local law enforcement and that hurts everybody's safety.  Let's consider the economic harm this order will cause. Immigrants make up 10 percent of California's workforce and contribute $130 billion to our State's gross domestic product. Immigrants own small businesses, they till the land, they care for children and the elderly, they work in our labs, they attend our universities, and they serve in our military. So these actions are not only cruel, but they cause ripple effects that harm our public safety and our economy.  The same is true of this Muslim ban. This ban may as well have been hatched in the basement headquarters of We handed them a tool of recruitment to use against us. Policies that demonize entire groups of people based on the God they worship have a way of conjuring real-life demons. Policies that isolate our Muslim-American communities take away one of the greatest weapons we have in the fight against homegrown extremism.  Here is the truth. Imperfect though we may be, I believe we are a great country. I believe we are a great country. Part of what makes us great are our democratic institutions that protect our fundamental ideals: freedom of religion and the rule of law, protection from discrimination based on national origin, freedom of the press, and a 200-year history as a nation built by immigrants.  So this brings me to my message today. We have a responsibility to draw a line with these administrative actions and say no. This is not a question of party. This is about the government of coequal branches, with its inherent checks and balances. This is about the role of the Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world. I know, having spent now a few weeks in this Chamber, that we have good men and women on both sides of the aisle--men and women who believe deeply in our immigrant communities and who understand that nationalism and patriotism are not the same thing.  I know that it was the junior Senator from the State of Texas who said: ``It is an enormous blessing to be the child of an immigrant who fled oppression, because you realize how fragile liberty is and how easily it can be taken away.''  It was the junior Senator from the great State of Kentucky who said: ``We must always embrace individual liberty and enforce the constitutional rights of all Americans, rich and poor, immigrants and natives, black and white.''  It was the senior Senator from the great State of Arizona who said: Undocumented immigrants should not be ``condemned forever'' to a twilight status.  So, yes, we have good people on both sides of the aisle. I say that we must measure up to our words and fight for our ideals because the critical hour is upon us.  I yield the floor.

1118,topic-id,3469,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to convey my wholehearted opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the U.Environmental Protection Agency, the  The EPA, at its core, is an Agency established to protect the environment and the public health of our This Agency looks to establish policies and guidelines that would benefit all Americans--and in essence is not an Agency of partisanship. In fact, the EPA was created through legislation led by a Republican President, Richard Nixon, and enacted by a bipartisan Congress in 1970.  The EPA has a duty to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the environment we hope to pass on to future generations. In accomplishing this mission, it enforces some of our most valued laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which have been in effect for more than 30 years.  Unfortunately, this President asked the U.Senate to confirm a nominee who has dedicated his career to undermining the very Agency he is asked to lead. Mr.Pruitt's record and consistent failure to commit to being a fair Administrator of the EPA further demonstrates that the Trump administration's agenda is to weaken protections that guarantee every American access to clean air and clean water. From his actions as attorney general of Oklahoma up to his testimony at his hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee, it is clear Mr.Pruitt is simply unqualified.  I express my strong concerns, as a Senator from California, a global leader in environmental protections that allow our 39 million residents to live healthy lives. It is my hope that with similar smart Federal regulations, which are led by the EPA, our Nation can enjoy these same benefits that I have seen Californians experience firsthand.  Californians have always been and will continue to be proud of our environmental leadership. In 1977, California passed the first energy efficiency standards in the country. Our friends from the States of Florida, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York quickly followed suit. This set a precedent. Federal officials agreed that having responsible renewable energy guidelines should be a priority.  Ten years later, the EPA implemented national standards across the United States, saving a tremendous amount of energy, sustaining our precious environment and resources for future generations, and providing financial benefits for families and households across the country.  To put it into perspective, one of the national energy standards for refrigerators--that was the result of a policy initially enacted in California--has saved more than 130,000 megawatts of electricity to date. This is equivalent to the production of energy that roughly 250 powerplants might produce. This example is not a rare occurrence. Energy policies have continued to be adopted from smart initiatives started in various  Starting as early as 1978, California passed an energy efficiency standard for newly constructed buildings. This standard is now adopted not only in our Nation but worldwide. The State legislature listened to the objective and factual data from scientists on the dangers of climate change and, as a result, passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which requires California to reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. We created the California Cap-and-Trade Program, which implemented an innovative, market-based system to allow companies to continue to produce while also helping to reduce emissions; instituted a low-carbon fuel standard, which reduced the carbon intensity of all transportation fuels in We passed the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008, which urged local transportation planning agencies to consider the statewide greenhouse reduction standards and goals in their long-term transportation plan, and we set a renewable portfolio standard, which implored retail sellers of electricity to provide 33 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by 2020 and 50 percent by 2030.  We are proud indeed of what we have accomplished in California, but the importance of this issue goes beyond just the environment. It is an economic issue, and it has been undeniable in helping California grow to be the sixth largest economy in the world. California shows that a healthy environment and a healthy economy and the choice between the two is a false choice. We can have both. From 1990 to 2014, California's population and economy grew while achieving a 36-percent drop in emissions per gross domestic product. This clearly demonstrates that you can successfully have economic growth and reduce carbon intensity. The State has done a great job of creating employment through the promotion of clean energy technology and green economies. A report by the University of California Labor Center found that the California renewable portfolio standards contributed to the creation of 25,500 hours for what was referred to as ``blue-collar'' job opportunities and 7,200 hours of what was referred to as ``white-collar'' jobs.  Most importantly, the environmental laws that the EPA enforces protects the health of future generations. Science has shown that children living in communities with a higher concentration of particulate matter developed respiratory difficulties and those children living in regions with higher ozone levels were more likely to develop asthma and miss school.  This is only a small part of the impact that ignoring the protections of our environment can cause to the ones we love most. On that point, of children missing school because of health concerns, there is a significance to this because of a connection between what we need to do to educate our population and also what we see in the criminal justice system.  For example, it is well known and established the significance of a third grade reading level. By the end of the third grade, if the child is not at the third grade reading level, they literally drop off because, when we think about it, we know before third grade a child is learning how to read, and then comprehension kicks in, and they are reading to learn. If they have not learned how to read, they cannot read to learn and they drop off.  What is the connection between that and the concern we have about pollution in the air and water? Well, there is a connection between pollution in the air and asthma rates. Asthma causes children to miss school. What we know is that we have seen that an elementary school truant is three to four times more likely to be a high school dropout; 82 percent of the prisoners in the United States are high school dropouts; African-American men between the ages of 30 and 34, if he is a high school dropout, is two-thirds likely to be in jail, have been in jail, or dead. There is a real connection between elementary school truancy and what we see in public safety systems. What we also know is that it costs money when children miss school. It costs us money in terms of the money that schools miss out on because they are not being reimbursed for attendance every day. All of these issues are connected.  As a former attorney general, I have worked to enforce California's cutting-edge environmental laws. This is what an attorney general should do and is obligated to do as a representative of her Without reservation, I can say I am proud of the work of my office--of my former office, the California Department of Justice, and the work that is happening and has happened throughout the years doing the right thing for the people of the State and for the environment.[[Page S1355]]  In February of 2011, I filed an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit Court to support the efforts of the Port of Los Angeles to reduce air pollution through its Clean Trucks In 2011, I had the pleasure of being a voice to protect an area of Southern California known as Mira Loma Village, a town of hard-working people, by representing them in a lawsuit to assure that a project would not significantly deteriorate the air quality in their community.  I had been hearing stories of the grandmothers in that community for years asking that they would be heard. I had been hearing for years, before I visited Mira Loma, about the fact that studies showed the children of that community had the lowest rate of lung development of any region in that part of There was a serious concern about the pollution in the air and the children of that community and their ability to be healthy.  So this is what we did and what I was able to do as the attorney general of the State that year. We met them with the developers in that community, we sat down, and we had some tough discussions, but we agreed that there had to be mitigation. They had to reduce the emissions in that community that resulted in the public health problems for that community. Two years later, that resulted in the city and the developer moving forward with the project while implementing measures to protect the residents from being exposed to diesel contamination. Litigation was critical. The role of the attorney general to be able to intervene and be a voice for that community and so many voiceless and vulnerable people was critical.  In June of 2014, as attorney general of California, I publicly opposed the lack of environmental review for the expansion of a Chevron refinery project in a place called Richmond, CA, and demanded they consider the public health of the nearby residents.  These are examples of the role and responsibility of a State attorney general to take seriously their oath in terms of protecting the health and welfare of the residents of their I offer these examples to further support the concerns we have that this nominee--when he has held such an important position and has taken an oath to represent the people--has failed to perform his duties. I would suggest that his past is prologue for the future. His past is an indication of what he will do if he is confirmed as the next head of the  I would hope that instead we would have a nominee--someone who would head these most important agencies in our government--who could say the same thing about their record as I am proud to say about the record of the California Department of  In my opinion, our current nominee cannot in good conscience speak to the same type of record. Instead, Mr.Pruitt has talked about how he wants to protect States from what he believes is ``overreach'' of the Federal His commitment to what he would call States' rights is so strident that a December 6, 2014, New York Times article reported that Mr.Pruitt has a painting in his office ``that shows local authorities with rifles at the ready confronting outsiders during the land rush era.'' He also established what he described and named as a Federalism Unit in the Oklahoma attorney general's office that was committed to fighting against Federal regulations. When he came before the Environment and Public Works Committee for his confirmation hearing, of which I am a Member, Mr.Pruitt stated that ``it is our state regulators who oftentimes best understand the local needs and uniqueness of our environmental challenges.'' He then went on to speak about how States ``possess the resources and the uniqueness of our environmental challenges.''  These statements might lead one to believe that Mr.Pruitt would be in support of any opportunity possible to give power back to the States to create environmental regulations. However, when I asked Mr.Pruitt at the committee, when he came before us, if he would commit then to upholding California's right to set its own vehicle emission standards, he would not commit to doing so.  I will remind this body that the EPA has a long tradition of respecting California's and other States' ability to set higher standards where they can control the emissions and the greenhouse gas emissions that as we have mentioned before, directly have an impact on the health and well-being of the residents of our State and particularly the children and the elderly of our  Under the Clean Air Act, California has set its own standards for how it wants to regulate vehicle emissions. We have done this for decades now, and previous EPA Administrators have upheld California's right to set them.  Although there is precedence for doing so, Mr.Pruitt would not commit to granting California the waiver to allow my State to continue to set its own vehicle emissions standards. This is simply unacceptable.  This is a blatant double standard for someone who claims to be committed to breaking down regulations at the Federal level and giving power back to the In fact, it makes me wonder how truly committed Mr.Pruitt is to States' rights or if States' rights are just a convenient argument for him in order to pursue actions that are beneficial to industries that pollute instead of the residents and the people of his State and, by extension, our country.  Just look at his record as attorney general of Oklahoma, a position he used to challenge the laws of other As attorney general, he challenged a California law when he joined a lawsuit that targeted a referendum that California's voters approved in 2008 to require more space in cages for egg-laying hens. That measure, California proposition 2, prohibited the confinement of hens used to produce eggs in California in any manner that does not allow them to turn around freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. The law is popular, and it was passed by the voters in my State by 63.5 percent. In 2010, the California Legislature expanded that law to make it so that it applied to all eggs sold in  Mr.Pruitt joined a lawsuit suing California over this law, presumably because he did not like that a regulation approved by our voters and affirmed by our State legislature would do a good job. He just didn't like it. Mr.Pruitt's case was ultimately rejected by the Federal appellate court because his lawsuit failed to demonstrate how the California law presented a harm to his You would think that a States' rights proponent would appreciate that one State passes a law and it should be respected, especially when it doesn't create any harm to his own State, but that was not the case.  Mr.Pruitt has filed seven lawsuits against the EPA that have since been settled. In those lawsuits, he opposed the Clean Power Plan and the Clean Water He sued over regulations to make electricity-generating powerplants install technology to curb air pollution. He sued over a plan to reduce pollution from coal-fired powerplants and a regulation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. He sued and filed a lawsuit that claimed that the EPA encourages environmental nonprofits to bring lawsuits.  It is important to know that Mr.Pruitt lost six out of those seven lawsuits. Mr.Pruitt is a baseball fan, as am I love my I find it hard to believe that my San Francisco Giants would look at a hitter who slogged through spring training with a .142 batting average and have no concerns whatsoever calling him up to the big league roster. Why does the U.Senate have a lower standard for reviewing a nominee who would be charged with safeguarding human health and our environment?  What about the opportunities Mr.Pruitt has had to defend the interests of the people he was elected to represent? What about issues that directly impact the people of Oklahoma?  In 2011, 49 States signed on to a $25 billion mortgage settlement. There was only one State's attorney general who decided not to sign on. I think you know where I am heading. That one attorney general was Scott Mr.Pruitt said he didn't think it was the appropriate role of the State attorney general to advocate for the homeowners of their States but wanted to be sure to protect the banks instead.  As a former State's attorney general, I am here to say that the role of an attorney general is to represent the people of your When an injustice is committed to one person, an injustice is committed to all of the residents of[[Page S1356]]your In fact, after doing the work of an attorney general over the course of 7 years in California, I will tell you that every time we filed a suit, that document, that complaint never read the name of the victim versus the name of the offender. It always read the people versus the offender because in our system of democracy and in our system of justice as a country, we have rightly said that a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. Mr.Pruitt has failed to appreciate the significance of that point.  He has developed a long list of lawsuits filed. Through all of that litigation, he has delivered very little for the people of Oklahoma--the very people who elected him to represent them. Why should we expect that he will protect the interests of all Americans and the environment we all share?  During his 6-year tenure as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt stated only in one instance--a lawsuit against Mahard Egg Farm--could he recall initiating an independent lawsuit as attorney general against private air polluters. It was later revealed that even this claim was misleading, and it turned out it was his predecessor who had done the legwork and initiated the proceedings, along with the assistance of the  In the 2014 New York Times article, it was reported that Mr.Pruitt used his official position as Oklahoma attorney general to protect the interests of a private gas and petroleum company, Devon Energy, not the people of Using his official government position, Mr.Pruitt sent a three-page letter to the EPA stating that Devon Energy did not cause as much air pollution as was calculated by Federal regulators.  In open records of exchanged emails between Devon Energy and the Oklahoma attorney general's office, it was discovered that the lawyers at Devon Energy were the ones who actually drafted the letter and that Mr.Pruitt used a nearly identical letter to express it as his State's position. Following the letter, Devon Energy wrote to his office:       Outstanding! The timing of this letter is great given our      meeting with both the EPA and the White  ``Outstanding,'' the energy company said--not the people of the State of  It is also unclear how far this abuse of power has gone. A lawsuit by the Center for Media and Democracy has been filed in an Oklahoma district court to release information on Mr.Pruitt's dealings as attorney general. It is with great concern that we would try to rush this nomination without these records coming to light. Senators should have all the facts before us before we vote.  Should Mr.Pruitt be confirmed as EPA Administrator, I am deeply concerned that he has refused to use his discretion to recuse himself from litigation he was involved with in his role as Oklahoma attorney general unless required to do so by the Ethics  I asked him about this during our hearing at the Environment and Public Works I asked him if he would be willing to recuse himself notwithstanding a finding by the Ethics Commission but based on what is right and an appearance of conflict. He agreed, after many questions, that he has the discretion--regardless of action, regardless of waiting until the Ethics Commission rules--to recuse himself from those lawsuits that he as attorney general of Oklahoma brought against the Agency he wants to lead. He agreed he had the discretion and yet failed to agree that he would exercise that discretion and recuse himself because of an appearance of a conflict. That is simply unacceptable.  It is so important that in our government, the public has confidence in us, that they trust we will do the right thing, that they trust we will use our discretion in an appropriate way. But this is a nominee who has asked us to trust him to lead the EPA, the people's Agency that has been charged with protecting the resources that are vital for all human life. A nominee who has failed to represent his own constituents' interests by making a career of partisanship is not the right nominee for this office, period. He is a nominee who has lobbied for corporations instead of the people he was charged with representing. He is a nominee who has a clear record of using his position in a way that has not been in the best interest of the people he serves.  There is evidence, unfortunately, of his record that is before us as a body. We should take heed of this evidence.

728,topic-id,316,"Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my unwavering support for the lives of the unborn, to stand in solidarity with the States, and to urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.43.  This resolution does not cut a dime from family planning funding available to It simply enables States to direct the funding towards nonabortion ``whole women'' healthcare providers, such as rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers.  It is important to remember that, for every Planned Parenthood clinic, there are 20 federally qualified health centers. Each year, these centers serve over 21 million American women. This is almost eight times the impact of Planned Parenthood clinics.  We know that Federal law requires that federally qualified health centers provide mammograms, prenatal services, and emergency medical services, none of which are offered by Planned Parenthood clinics.  The States were wise to prioritize such quality health care for women with title X funds. Prior to this new, heavy-handed, agenda-driven policy, the States maintained the flexibility to determine grant recipients. This last-minute Obama administration rule effectively nullifies the policy of 13 States that want to prioritize women's health over abortion.  This Obama-era rule could also impair funding for another 10 States that have chosen comprehensive care over abortion-focused clinics like Planned But it gets worse. Of the 13 States impacted by this rule, five States--Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Ohio--could lose almost $16 million in title X funding for failing to abide by the rule. This regulation forces these States to forego their title X funding for all of the women in their  Today's resolution resolves this encroachment on the States, rolls back this last-minute rule, and restores flexibility to the States so that women can receive the health care they deserve.  I would like to thank Chairman Black for her work on this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.43.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1268.txt,2032,1415,2017.0,16.0,February
967,topic-id,1188,"Mr.President, I rise today, honored to speak after my colleague from New Hampshire and joining my other colleagues in opposing the nomination of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Our beautiful natural resources define my home State of New From the White Mountains to the Seacoast, to our pristine lakes and our forests, our natural resources are critical to our economy, our environment, our way of life, and protecting these resources plays a critical role, as well, in protecting public health.  However, we are already beginning to see the real impacts of climate change in New Hampshire, and these impacts threaten to have major consequences for our natural resources and families and businesses in every corner of my Recognizing that fact, members of both parties have come together in New Hampshire to enact commonsense bipartisan solutions to take on climate change and to grow and maintain our State's renewable clean energy sector. We have worked to protect our land, our air and water, and the health of our citizens.  Unfortunately, it is clear from Mr.Pruitt's opposition to the Agency he will be tasked to lead, his record of working to weaken critical environmental protections that our citizens need to thrive, and his unwillingness to fight climate change, that he is unfit to serve in this position.  The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency begins with protecting our environment and the health of all of our citizens. The EPA does critical work to protect the water we drink and the air we breathe.  In recent years, the EPA has used sound scientific evidence to take strong measures to protect our environment. Unfortunately, President Trump has made clear that he does not support this critical Throughout his campaign, the President has repeatedly attacked the EPA, calling for its elimination and saying that our environment would be ``just fine'' without it. The President has doubled down on his hostility toward this Agency by nominating Mr.Pruitt to serve as its  As attorney general, Mr.Pruitt has been a vocal critic of the very Agency he has now been nominated to lead, and he has been involved in over 20 legal actions against it.  According to the Washington Post, Mr.Pruitt has ``spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the very agency he is being nominated to lead.''  On social media, Mr.Pruitt has referred to himself as ``a leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.'' He has questioned the role of the Agency, stating that ``the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''  When asked by one of my colleagues if there were any clean air or clean water EPA regulations in place today that he could support, Mr.Pruitt declined to name a single one.  The foundation of a future where all Americans have an opportunity to thrive starts with a healthy environment and healthy families. The EPA serves an important role in protecting the health of our people. We must do better than having an Administrator who has fought so tirelessly to undermine the work that this Agency does.  I am also concerned by an EPA Administrator who has consistently voiced skepticism about the clear facts on climate change. Throughout my time in office, I have always fought to protect our environment and have been a strong supporter of curbing the impacts of climate change. As a State[[Page S1247]]senator, I sponsored legislation that allowed New Hampshire to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and I helped pass the State's renewable portfolio standard to maintain and grow New Hampshire's clean renewable energy sector.  During my time as Governor, I worked with members of both parties to strengthen and build on those efforts, signing legislation to update the renewable portfolio standard and to maximize the benefits of the Regional Greenhouse Gas  I am proud that my State has long led efforts to cut carbon emissions, and it is crucial that other States follow our lead and take responsibility for the pollution that they cause. That is exactly why I am a strong supporter of measures like the Clean Power  I also strongly support the Paris agreement on climate change and believe that the United States must take action to implement the agreement while also ensuring that our international partners fulfill their obligations.  Mr.Pruitt, however, has been a consistent skeptic on the role of climate change and the role that it has had on our environment.  Mr.Pruitt has stated that we do not know the extent of human impact on climate change and has called climate change a natural occurrence. He has said that climate change is ``one of the major policy debates of our time.''  And he continued:       That debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to      disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and      its connection to the actions of mankind.  Scientists are clear in their understanding of the climate change science. The American Association for the Advancement of Science says the scientific evidence is clear: Global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society.  The American Geophysical Union says that humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years.  The American Meteorological Society says it is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half a century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and human influence on the climate system is clear.  The EPA is a science-based organization, and it is unacceptable for the EPA Administrator to be at odds with the well-established views of leading scientists. As the Agency's own website says:       EPA is one of the world's leading environmental and human      health research organizations. Science provides the      foundation for Agency policies, actions, and decisions made      on behalf of the American people. Our research incorporates      science and engineering that meet the highest standards      for integrity, peer review, transparency, and ethics.  Mr.Pruitt disagrees with well-established climate science. Simply put, that disqualifies him from leading an agency where ``science provides the foundation for . . . policies, actions, and decisions.'' If you refuse to believe research from the world's leading scientists, you cannot lead a science-based agency.  From protecting our environment to protecting public health, the EPA plays a critical role in protecting the health of Granite Staters and all We know that a cleaner environment plays a key role in the economy, for the economy of New Hampshire and our entire country. We should be building on the critical efforts the EPA has taken to combat climate change and protect public health, not rolling them back.  Mr.Pruitt's hostility to the basic functions of the Environmental Protection Agency and his work to undermine protections for clean air, land, and water make clear that he should not serve in this role.  I will vote against Mr.Pruitt's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.

74,topic-id,1282,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding to me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  I rise to debate the rule for consideration, which bundles together two completely unrelated pieces of legislation. One is a joint resolution disapproving of a Department of Labor rule that relates to the drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants. The other, as the gentleman just described, is the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey  There are many more important issues, in my opinion, that face this country at the moment, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out why my colleagues across the aisle think that ceding Bureau of Land Management survey authority over federally owned land to the States and impugning the integrity of those who rightfully seek unemployment insurance are on the same list of important matters this body should be addressing.  First, I would note the odd events that brought us here today as we operate, once again, under a closed rule. I just heard the debate on the previous rule, and I was illuminated by the gentleman from Alabama, on the other side, who indicated that the rule wasn't closed because we had a debate in the Rules Committee yesterday for 1 hour. A closed rule is a closed rule. It means that other Members of this body do not have an opportunity to have their amendments heard and/or made in order. We are now entering our 13th of these closed rules in a body that claimed that it was going to have open rules and regular order.  On February 3, Congressman McClintock wrote to Chairman Sessions, asking that the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act be heard under a structured rule, which still isn't an open rule. An amendment deadline was set, and two germane amendments with no budgetary issues were submitted. Nevertheless, my Republican colleagues shut down the process and reported a closed rule. As of today, two-thirds of all of the rules issued this session by the Rules Committee have been closed rules. We should not be conducting the people's business this way.  I call on my Republican colleagues to put their unfounded fear aside and let this body operate under regular order, under open rules, or, at the very least, under structured rules.[[Page H1146]]  I am dismayed to see, even when the Republican chairman of a subcommittee asks the Republican chairman of the Rules Committee for a structured rule, that the Republican leadership sees fit to ignore that request and continue this closed process--stifling ideas and debate before they can even get started.  It is this kind of shifting decisionmaking that sows distrust and disappointment in the American people when they survey how business is conducted in their However, it is not just this kind of duplicitous behavior that undermines this institution, but, as I mentioned moments ago, a complete lack of an ability to get our priorities straight.  We still have plenty of folks who are looking for jobs. We have plenty of people who are terrified that they will soon lose the health care that keeps them and their children living healthy and productive lives. We have plenty of people who are understandably concerned that our immigration policy has taken a deep dive into the shallow end. But we don't come here to address these important issues. Instead, my Republican colleagues bring to the floor, week after week, legislation to undermine well-thought-out agency rules and make it increasingly difficult for our agencies to carry out their duties.  The fact that we need to come here today and discuss the efficacy of having the Bureau of Land Management manage our Nation's land is beyond me. For nearly 100 years, the Bureau of Land Management has conducted uncontested surveys, and now we are supposed to believe that, all of a sudden, the agency is not following the appropriate standard. If folks don't like the survey methods or think the wrong standard is being used, then one needs to go through the court system. One does not engage in the unprecedented measure of ceding to the States the Federal Government's legitimate authority over Federal land.  The second completely unrelated resolution, H.42, overturns a Department of Labor rule regarding the drug testing of Americans who apply for unemployment compensation. Under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, States were given the authority to conduct drug tests on unemployment insurance applicants under two circumstances: if the applicant were terminated from a previous job due to unlawful drug use or if the only available, suitable work were in an occupation that regularly conducts drug testing.  The rule in question clarifies that occupations that ``regularly conduct drug testing'' include occupations that are specifically identified in State or Federal law as requiring an employee to be tested. Put another way, if a State thinks a job warrants a drug test, all it needs to do is add the job to a list. The rule strikes a balance, preserving deference to States while providing commonsense clarity to the law. This is how things should be done--that is, the regulations that were in force until now, at least.  Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, common sense is not put to much use around here these days. Republicans want to repeal the rule because, one would have to assume, it does not go far enough in embarrassing those people who are simply trying to obtain unemployment insurance during a difficult time. Let us be crystal clear in that the only purpose this repeal can serve is to embarrass folks, because there is no evidence linking those who seek unemployment insurance to increased rates of drug abuse. Be that as it may, Republicans still insist on expanding expensive and offensive drug screenings.  Today, once again, we see the Republicans engaging in the Trumpian exercise of creating alternative facts. In today's example, we have a resolution that is based on the blanket assumption that unemployed Americans use drugs. It further implies that Americans who apply for unemployment benefits are to blame for being unemployed. This implication is as unfounded as it is offensive to those hardworking Americans who find themselves unemployed due to no fault of their own.  And what do these hardworking Americans get for their troubles--a Congress dedicated to ensuring that new and well-paid jobs are there for them tomorrow?  Not at all. Instead, they get a Republican-led Congress that is bent on subjecting them to unconstitutional, offensive, and expensive drug tests.  Like it or not, facts still matter. Here is one: a conservative estimate by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration puts the cost of drug testing at $25 to $75 per test. Because Federal law prohibits charging applicants for these tests, States would have to absorb the cost of testing thousands of unemployed workers. In the State of Texas, for instance, that would translate to, approximately, $30 million for a single year of testing. A while back, we spent a lot of time around here talking about unfunded mandates, and somehow or another, this one, I guess, doesn't fit in that category.  Mr.Speaker, arbitrarily testing Americans who apply for unemployment compensation runs contrary to our Constitution and is a solution in search of a problem. Being unemployed is not a sufficient reason to be subjected to a government-operated drug test. Proposals like this blame unemployed Americans for being unemployed. It is illegal and it is a huge waste of money. We have got some real problems that we need to address in this At some point, this Congress will need to get to work.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1145.txt,511,1415,2017.0,14.0,February
76,topic-id,311,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  While we are discussing these matters that my colleagues want to discuss that I don't think are paramount or issues that are vital to America's security, there are a plethora of issues that we could be discussing, and rightly should be. Toward that end, one of the things that the minority is given as an opportunity is to offer a previous question to the matter that is on the floor at this time.  So I exercise that prerogative by asserting that the National Security Council was established in 1947 to encourage candid discussions between the Federal agencies charged with keeping America safe to ensure they would provide the President with the best policy advice possible. For this very reason, security experts on both sides of the aisle agree that partisan politics have no place in the Council's deliberations.  With this in mind, it is deeply troubling that President Donald John Trump would promote Steve Bannon, his chief political adviser, to a full seat on the Council's Principals Committee, while simultaneously relegating the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence to a lower status. At the very least, this sends the very dangerous signal that the Trump White House intends to let political calculations influence its decisionmaking on the life-and-death matters of national security.  Mr.Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Stephanie Murphy's bill to prohibit political advisers from regularly attending National Security Council meetings.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1571,topic-id,1095,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to debate the rule for consideration. As my friend across the aisle has already noted, this rule bundles together two unrelated pieces of legislation. We are developing a pattern here of doing that in the Rules  The first of these is H.83, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that seeks to overturn a Department of Labor rule on workplace injuries, undermining workplace safety and health in the process.  The second measure is H.998, the SCRUB Act, which establishes a new commission to review Federal regulations with the aim of needlessly politicizing and, thereby, undermining the regulatory framework that keeps our air clean and our water safe to drink.  I note that my friend on the other side of the aisle did not mention that this commission will cost $30 million for work that last night's presenter at the Rules Committee said that Congress can do, the argument being that Congress doesn't have enough staff so we are going to send it over to nine people and pay $30 million, starting, to have them do the work that we in Congress should be doing.  Beginning with the CRA resolution--the 14th such resolution considered by the House this month--the Republican leadership is continuing its onslaught against well-thought-out and measured regulations. I get it. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White They are desperately trying to ram through their priorities before anyone notices what they are doing.  It is interesting to me, Mr.Speaker, where the Republican majority has focused its attention throughout the past month. I can't help but notice that 40 days into Donald John Trump's administration, he has not put forth one single jobs measure. Democrats, on the[[Page H1365]]other hand, continue to talk about the need for good, well-paying jobs. The United States Senate put out the Democrats' trillion-dollar jobs plan that anybody can read on their website on where we stand when it comes to well-paying jobs.  Yet, as we advocate for our plan to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure and create over 15 million jobs in the process, Republicans pass measures to drug-test applicants for unemployment insurance and repeal rules that require Federal contractors to disclose violations of Federal labor and worker safety laws.  This resolution repeals a Department of Labor rule pertaining to the Occupational Safety and Health The rule in question requires employers to keep and maintain accurate records of every recordable injury and illness in federally mandated logs for a period of 5 years.  It is worth mentioning that this policy has been upheld in cases dating back to 1993. The rule, when implemented, added zero new compliance obligations, zero new reporting obligations, and cost a total of--you guessed it--zero dollars. Yet, once again, this is what we are spending our time on this week: repealing a thoughtful rule designed to protect workers.  I am particularly concerned by this resolution as it actually jeopardizes workplace safety by allowing employers to avoid penalties for the underreporting of injuries over many years. Longstanding workplace hazards will and can certainly be masked.                              {time}  1230  This makes it less likely that employers or employees will take corrective actions or that OSHA will find the hazards when they do an inspection, leaving workers in danger.  It is also worth noting that due to its very small budget, OSHA is only able to inspect a workplace, on average, once every 140 years. You heard me correctly, once every 140 years. That makes data even more important. Yet, by diminishing the reliability of a worksite's injury data, which some employers systematically underreport, this resolution also takes away OSHA's ability to protect workers from the most significant hazards.  Mr.Speaker, throughout the past week, concerned Americans attended town halls across the country, and for those who were actually able to meet with their Republican representative in Congress, the conversations focused on protecting health care, creating jobs, and protecting the environment. At these meetings, constituents did not ask for fewer workplace protections, they did not ask for Congress to act to make it easier for people with severe mental illness to purchase guns, they didn't ask for Congress to ease disclosure requirements for oil companies making payments to foreign governments, and yet these are the things the Republican majority has already chosen to focus on this month.  Watching the news, I did not hear one person say: if only Congress would repeal anticorruption rules, undermine my retirement security, and then allow endangered animals on national wildlife refuges to be killed using inhumane methods, if only Congress would do these things, my life would be better. Not one person, Mr.Yet, in the past month, the House voted to do all of the things that I just mentioned. I submit to the American people watching at home right now that this is the face of today's Republican Tell me who you think is really on your side.  Turning our attention to the SCRUB Act, this bill would establish a $30 million commission with unlimited subpoena authority that is empowered to dismantle long-established, science-based public health and safety standards. The SCRUB Act would undermine the ability of agencies to react to immediate public health threats by adopting the regulatory CutGo process. The CutGo system is, in my opinion, completely detached from reality. This requirement will prohibit agencies from issuing any new rules, even in the case of emergencies or imminent harm to the public, until they repeal an existing rule to offset the cost. Along with bills that have already come to the House floor under this Republican Congress, as well as Donald Trump's executive actions mandating a regulatory freeze, this legislation demonstrates a continued attack on standards set in place to protect American families.  I guess it is not all that surprising that my Republican friends are pushing through legislation that prioritizes corporate profit over health and safety of the American people. Whether it is denying access to women's health care or rolling back environmental protections, Republicans are making it clear where their allegiances lie. For a party that prides itself on being anti-red tape, the SCRUB Act strangely duplicates existing requirements to conduct retrospective reviews of rules, rules on top of rules on top of rules. Our regulatory system should work for all American families and encourage companies to run safe, forward-thinking businesses. This legislation would move us in the opposite direction.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1363-4.txt,511,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,28.0,February

I appreciate the passion of my friend from I would suggest to him that I am amused that he would get in the weeds in a rather substantial legal opinion. A portion of it he correctly cited, but he omitted the continuing part of the judge's remarks that said that, indeed, you could go back and put forth a resolution.  I find it particularly amusing that my friends on the other side, after not granting that judge a hearing so that he could become a Supreme Court Justice, now want to say what a great judge he is and what a great amount of work he does. Shame on everyone who did not give him an appropriate hearing. But I understand what it is to steal a Justice of the Supreme Court, and that is what my friends on the Republican side did. This judge's opinion continued on to say that you could establish regulations.  Mr.Speaker, up until now, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information.

Donald John Trump's campaign rhetoric doesn't fit the actual challenges of governing, and I believe my friends on the other side of the aisle are starting to come to this realization.

219,topic-id,650,"Mr.President, the Senate is now considering H.40, a resolution of disapproval regarding a misguided Social Security Administration regulation that infringes on many Americans' Second Amendment rights. As a cosponsor of the Senate companion to this resolution, which was filed by Chairman Grassley, I would like to add my voice to that of the many advocates, including the National Disabilities Rights Network and groups such as the National Rifle Association that work to protect the rights of law-abiding gun owners who have expressed support for this important legislation.  I would also like to express my appreciation to Chairman Grassley and others for their leadership on this issue. This ill-advised regulation not only stigmatizes individuals with disabilities, it also violates the Second Amendment and due process rights of many Americans, and it should be repealed.  As a longtime supporter of Americans' constitutional right to keep and bear arms, I was deeply troubled by this regulation, which allows the Social Security Administration to report individuals they consider, in the words used in the regulation, to be ``mentally defective'' to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, if they have ``mental impairments,'' receive disability insurance benefits, and receive those benefits through a representative payee.  When someone receives benefits through SSA's representative payee program, SSA field office employees have deemed them unable to manage their finances. However, SSA's representative payee program itself is, by many accounts, ineffectively administered.  You don't have to take my word for it. As recently as 2013, the Government Accountability Office identified that SSA ``struggles to effectively administer its Payee Program.'' There are unexplained and large discrepancies across various regions of the country that SSA serves in numbers of beneficiaries who are assigned by SSA field offices to be in the payee program. Yet, despite these known gaps and discrepancies, SSA apparently thought that this system was sufficient to determine whether some beneficiaries should be afforded a constitutional right.  Let's be clear. Under SSA's rule, individuals who are not found by SSA employees or any other competent authority to be a danger to themselves or others but rather simply need help managing their finances will be prohibited from legally purchasing a firearm. While we all want to make sure that the NICS system works effectively to prevent violent criminals and those who actually do pose a threat from purchasing firearms, this regulation is exceedingly overbroad. Moreover, it is not at all clear to me that SSA employees in field offices should be put in charge of deciding who can legally purchase a firearm. Of course, the bureaucrats at SSA who were prodded by the Obama administration to write the rule say they will create some sort of internal structure to allow beneficiaries to appeal the decisions of SSA employees. Of course, that means SSA would need to construct a new costly adjudication system to review decisions that its employees are not well-equipped to make in the first place. This is particularly strange, given that it is standard practice at SSA to decry the agency's funding levels while also claiming it is already unable to adequately serve its beneficiaries due to budgetary shortfalls.  All of this simply does not add up. The SSA is not at all equipped for this kind of decisionmaking; moreover, the standards that would apply under the regulation for SSA to report a beneficiary to the NICS represent a much lower bar than the one anticipated in the applicable Federal statutes to determine the eligibility to purchase a firearm. That being the case, we need to pass Chairman Grassley's resolution of disapproval, which has already been approved by the House of Representatives with bipartisan support.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this resolution.  I thank my friend from Oregon for allowing me to go forward on this short set of remarks.  I yield the floor.

567,topic-id,2753,"Mr.President, 2 weeks ago, President Trump nominated Tenth Circuit judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado to fill the vacancy left by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Judge Gorsuch, in my opinion, is the ideal choice to fill this seat. He has impeccable credentials and a decade-long record on the bench demonstrating a keen understanding of the proper role of a judge.  Given the increasingly contentious nature of the confirmation process, it is not surprising that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and their special interest group allies are stretching to find anything objectionable about Judge Gorsuch, no matter how ridiculous.  Today, I wish to address one of their latest, most outlandish claims: that Judge Gorsuch would not serve as an independent check on the executive branch. For example, last week in Politico, Senator Schumer, the distinguished Senator from New York, declared in an opinion piece: ``The most important factor in assessing a Supreme Court nominee . . . is whether or not the potential justice will be an independent check on an executive who may act outside our nation's laws and the Constitution.'' Senator Schumer doubled down on these comments in the New York There, he argued that it was impossible for him to discern Judge Gorsuch's judicial independence when they met in person. Why? Because Judge Gorsuch refused to say how he would rule on specific issues or how he would review particular government actions. These misleading narratives are an irrelevant, wasteful distraction from our consideration of Judge Gorsuch's sterling record and the merits of confirming him to the Supreme  Last month, I warned that the left would use these diversion tactics in an attempt to discredit the President's nominee. Shortly before Judge Gorsuch's nomination was announced, I predicted in an opinion piece in the Washington Post that advocates and interest groups would want to know how the nominee would decide particular cases before those cases ever reached the Court to make sure the nominee is on the right team. I was right.  Our Nation's Founders would have been embarrassed by such questions. Instead, the questions we ask should focus on whether the nominee will interpret and apply the law faithfully and neutrally no matter what the issue is. After all, that is what our Constitution demands.  Our Founders are not the only ones who would be embarrassed. I have been in the Senate for the last dozen Supreme Court confirmations. Every nominee we have considered has rightly refused to answer such questions. Consider, for example, Justice Ginsburg's response at her confirmation hearing. She said:       A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts,      no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the      specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain      for the entire judicial process.  Just last month in a speech in Arizona, Justice Sotomayor had an even stronger warning against asking and answering such questions. She said:       What you want is for us to tell you how as a judicial      nominee we're going to rule on the important issues you find      vexing. . . . Any self-respecting judge who comes in with an      agenda that would permit that judge to tell you how they will      vote is the kind of person you don't want as a judge.  So let's stop with this nonsense of trying to get Judge Gorsuch to prejudge issues that could come before the I hope my colleagues appreciate the irony in asking a judge to say how they would rule on particular issues in order to prove that the judge is judicially independent. I agree with Justice Sotomayor: A nominee who will tell you how she would vote is the kind of person you do not want as a judge.  But if judicial independence really is the most important factor, as Senator Schumer suggests, then this confirmation process should be the easiest one in the Senate's history. Over 11 years on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has consistently demonstrated in his judicial opinions and other writings that he deeply values the constitutional separation of powers between the three branches of the Federal Judge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution gives each branch distinct roles: Congress makes the laws, the President enforces those laws, and the courts interpret those laws and the The branches may act only according to the powers the Constitution grants them, with the remaining powers and rights reserved to the States and ultimately to the people.  With respect to the power of the executive branch, Judge Gorsuch has a strong record of reining in actions which violate the Constitution and the[[Page S1191]]law. Perhaps the best example is his opinion in the immigration case Gutierrez-Brizuela v. There, the Attorney General attempted to apply a new agency rule retroactively prohibiting a noncitizen from receiving relief under Federal immigration law. Writing for the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch ruled that such action exceeded the executive's power to enforce the law.  In a separate opinion, he noted that there is an elephant in the room: the so-called Chevron deference doctrine, which requires courts to defer to Federal agency interpretations of the law we pass. He expressed constitutional concerns about Chevron deference. Judge Gorsuch wrote:       [T]he fact is Chevron . . . permit[s] executive      bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and      legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that      seems more than a little difficult to square with the      Constitution of the framers' design. Maybe the time has come      to face the behemoth.  Judge Gorsch then proceeded to provide a textbook explanation of the proper separation of powers under our As he stated, the Founders included a strong separation of powers in the Constitution because ``[a] government of diffused powers, they knew, is a government less capable of invading the liberties of the people.''  As my colleagues know, I am no fan of Chevron deference. Last Congress, I introduced the Separation of Powers Restoration Act to get rid of it. As I noted when I introduced the legislation, regulators have taken advantage of the courts' deference under Chevron to shoehorn the law for their own political agenda, expanding their authority well beyond congressional intent. But the Constitution's separation of powers makes clear that it is the responsibility of the courts, not the bureaucracy, to interpret the law. So I am pleased Judge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution requires Federal judges to serve as an independent check on how Federal agencies interpret the laws we enact.  Separation of powers is not just about ensuring that the executive branch performs its proper role of executing the law; separation of powers is also about making sure Federal judges understand their proper role under the As Chief Justice Marshall famously explained in Marbury v. Madison, judges have a constitutional duty to say what the law is. Simply put, judges must be faithful interpreters of our laws and the  Under our constitutional separation of powers, it is not the role of Federal judges to make or change laws by imposing their own policy preferences. It is not their role to look beyond the law to consider their personal views and feelings. And it is not their role to choose winners and losers based on subjective beliefs that favor one group over another.  In my 40 years in the Senate, I have reviewed the record of hundreds of nominees for the Federal bench. I don't think I have ever reviewed the record of a nominee who better understands his proper role under the Constitution than Judge Consider, for example, Judge Gorsuch's touching tribute to Justice Scalia that was published last year in the Case Western Reserve Law In that speech, Judge Gorsuch eloquently explained how judges should not be in the business of ruling in ways that reflect their own political views or policy preferences. Judges, after all, are not elected legislators. Instead, judges should interpret the law as written. They must start with the text of the statute and then utilize the traditional tools of statutory interpretations to discern the meaning of any particular law.  Judge Gorsuch understands, to borrow from Alexander Hamilton, that the judiciary should be the least dangerous branch. These aren't just words; Judge Gorsuch's judicial record confirms that he lives this judicial philosophy of restraint and humility.  In an essay I published last week on SCOTUSblog, I reviewed a number of judicial opinions by Judge Gorsuch that demonstrate his commitment to the separation of powers and the proper role of a judge in our Federal system. I will not go through all of those cases here, but I ask unanimous consent that the essay be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           [From SCOTUSblog]   Worried About the Separation of Powers? Then Confirm Judge Gorsuch                        (By Senator Orrin Hatch)       Last week, President Donald Trump nominated Judge Neil      Gorsuch to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.Supreme      Judge Gorsuch is an ideal choice to fill this seat: He      has impeccable credentials and a decade-long record on the      bench demonstrating a keen understanding of the proper role      of a judge. Given the increasingly contentious nature of the      confirmation process, it is no surprise that many Democrats      are stretching to find anything objectionable about Judge      Gorsuch, no matter how ridiculous. In the current political      environment, they have focused much of their criticism on one      particularly strained argument: their claim that Justice      Gorsuch would not serve as an independent check on the      executive branch.       Fortunately, we do not have to speculate about how Justice      Gorsuch would decide these kinds of cases. Judge Gorsuch has      consistently demonstrated in his judicial opinions and other      writings that he deeply values the constitutional separation      of powers between the three branches of the federal      government. Judge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution      gives each branch distinct roles: Congress makes the laws,      the President enforces those laws, and the courts interpret      those laws and the The branches may act only      according to the powers the Constitution grants them, with      the remaining powers and rights reserved to the states and,      ultimately, to the people.       With respect to the power of the executive branch, Judge      Gorsuch has a strong record of reining in unlawful overreach.      For instance, in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, the Attorney      General had attempted to apply a new agency rule      retroactively to prohibit a noncitizen from receiving relief      under federal immigration law. Writing for the U.Court of      Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch concluded that      such action exceeded the executive's power to enforce the      law. In a separate opinion, he went one step further and      expressed concerns about how judge-made doctrines that      require judicial deference to federal agency actions--namely,      Chevron deference and its progeny--''permit executive      bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and      legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that      seems more than a little difficult to square with the      Constitution of the framers' design.'' Judge Gorsuch then      proceeded to provide a textbook explanation of the proper      separation of powers between the three branches, concluding      that ``[i]t was to avoid dangers like these, dangers the      founders had studied and seen realized in their own time,      that they pursued the separation of powers. A government of      diffused powers, they knew, is a government less capable of      invading the liberties of the people.''       Nor is Judge Gorsuch a supporter of federal judges who go      beyond their constitutional role in interpreting the law. As      Judge Gorsuch has eloquently explained, ``judges should be in      the business of declaring what the law is using the      traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing      the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own      political views, always with an eye on the outcome, and      engaged perhaps in some Benthamite calculation of pleasures      and pains along the way.'' It is not judges' role to make or      change laws by imposing their own policy preferences instead      of what Congress actually passed. It is not their role to      look beyond the text of the law to consider their personal      views and feelings. And it is not their role to choose      winners and losers based on subjective beliefs that favor one      group over another. Judge Gorsuch's opinions reinforce his      judicial philosophy of restraint and humility and his proper      understanding--to borrow from Alexander Hamilton--that the      judiciary should be the ``least dangerous'' branch.       Consider, for example, United States v. Games-There,      the 10th Circuit upheld a conviction for possession of a      firearm by a felon. The criminal defendant argued that he was      unaware that he was a convicted felon, but the court rejected      this argument as foreclosed by the court's prior precedent.      Judge Gorsuch penned a separate opinion. He agreed that the      court was bound by its own precedent, but he wrote separately      to urge the court to reconsider its precedent in light of the      plain text of the statute that requires the government to      prove the defendant knew he was a convicted felon. As Judge      Gorsuch explained, ``we might be better off applying the law      Congress wrote than the one [the court] hypothesized. It is a      perfectly clear law as it is written, plain in its terms,      straightforward in its application.'' He continued: ``Of      course, if Congress wishes to revise the plain terms of [the      statute], it is free to do so anytime. But there is simply no      right or reason for this court to be in that business.''       Sometimes a judge is asked to consider the proper      separation of powers between all three branches. For      instance, in Hobby Lobby Stores, v. Sebelius, the 10th      Circuit considered whether certain regulations issued by the      U.Department of Health and Human Services under the      Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act violated the      plaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration      In particular, the plaintiffs argued that the      regulations' health[[Page S1192]]     insurance mandate for employers violated RFRA's statutory      protections on religious freedom by forcing employers to      provide health insurance coverage for abortion-     inducing drugs and devices. Judge Gorsuch's opinion explained      why the owners of one of the plaintiff companies were      entitled to relief under As an initial matter, he noted      that the owners' ``religious convictions are contestable''      and that ``[s]ome may even find [their] beliefs offensive,''      but that RFRA ``does perhaps its most important work in      protecting unpopular religious beliefs.''       Judge Gorsuch then turned to the statutory interpretation      question at issue and noted that the case was a ``tale of two      statutes.'' Wrote Judge Gorsuch: ``The ACA compels the      [plaintiffs] to act. RFRA says they need not. We are asked to      decide which legislative direction controls.'' To decide      which statute controlled, he did not defer to the executive      branch's position on the matter. Nor did he seek to impose      his own policy preferences. To the contrary, he noted that      ``[t]he tiebreaker is found not in our own opinions about      good policy but in the laws Congress enacted.'' Because      ``Congress structured RFRA to override other legal mandates,      including its own statutes, if and when they encroach on      religious liberty,'' and ``because the government identifies      no explicit exclusion in the ACA to its dictates,'' Judge      Gorsuch concluded, RFRA's directive prevailed.       Even a casual review of Judge Gorsuch's opinions should      eliminate any concerns my Senate colleagues may have      concerning his commitment to the Constitution's separation of      powers. In his opinions, Judge Gorsuch has resisted executive      branch efforts to make laws as opposed to merely enforcing      those laws as written. Indeed, his opinions and other      writings cogently make the case for this approach to      separation of powers in a way that finds few rivals on the      federal bench and reminds me much of the case Justice Scalia      made during his time on the Judge Gorsuch, moreover,      has been a model of respect for the proper judicial role, a      judicial philosophy under which ``judges seek to interpret      texts as reasonable affected parties might have done rather      than rewrite texts to suit their own policy preferences.''       To be sure, that Justice Gorsuch would be a fierce defender      of the separation of powers and the rule of law does not mean      his rulings will match his policy preferences, much less      mine. In fact, in his tribute speech to Justice Scalia last      year, Judge Gorsuch embraced Justice Scalia's philosophy of      judicial restraint: ``If you're going to be a good and      faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that      you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach.''      That is precisely why Judge Gorsuch is the right choice for      the Supreme  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,1351,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE BY SECRETARY OF,2017.0,15.0,February
568,topic-id,2614,"To be sure, that Justice Gorsuch would be a fierce defender of the separation of powers does not mean his rulings will match his policy preferences. As Justice Scalia wisely remarked, good and faithful judges will not always like the conclusions they reach in interpreting the law. And it certainly does not mean that his rulings will match my policy preferences or those of my colleagues. As I have repeatedly stated on this floor over decades, that is not the proper inquiry when we assess the qualifications of a nominee to the Federal bench. Federal judges must be judges, not super-legislators.  The bottom line is, even a casual review of Judge Gorsuch's opinions should eliminate any concerns my colleagues may have concerning Judge Gorsuch's commitment to the Constitution's separation of powers. Any review would lead to that conclusion. In his opinions, Judge Gorsuch has resisted executive branch efforts to make laws as opposed to merely enforcing those laws. Judge Gorsuch's opinions and other writings make the compelling case for separation of powers in a way that finds few rivals on the current Federal bench.  If my colleagues are truly concerned about the proper separation of powers between the three branches of government, there is a simple solution: Confirm Judge Gorsuch as an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme                   Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare  Mr.President, I want to once again discuss the ongoing effort to repeal and replace the so-called Affordable Care This is one of our most vexing issues of the day. Of course, this isn't the first time I have come to the floor to discuss ObamaCare, and I am fairly certain it won't be the last.  I was here just last week, in fact, talking about the general unanimity among Republicans on these issues, despite the seemingly eternal focus on the supposed divisions among our ranks. While some are still advancing that narrative, Republicans are, overall, still united in our desire to repeal and replace As I said last week, I don't know if there is a single Republican in Congress who supports keeping the healthcare status quo in place. All of us want to right what went wrong with the poorly named Affordable Care Act and provide patients and consumers with more healthcare choices that address healthcare costs.  Most differences of opinion that do exist on these matters are more about timing than anything else. As I have said before, I support moving quickly to repeal ObamaCare and include as many replacement policies as possible under the rules of the reconciliation process. More specifically, I support repealing ObamaCare's harmful taxes, and I will explain why.  Put simply, the tax provisions in ObamaCare were poorly conceived and recklessly enacted, and they are harmful to our economy. Those taxes came in a number of forms, including the employer mandate and the individual mandate, both of which are enforced through the Tax  In addition, there is the health insurance tax, the Cadillac tax, along with new taxes on healthcare savings and pharmaceuticals. ObamaCare also included a payroll tax hike for some high-income earners as well as additional taxes on investing. And, of course, we cannot forget the medical device tax, which, in just the first 3 years that ObamaCare was implemented, resulted in more than 30,000 lost jobs in that important industry.  All told, the tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act represented a trillion-dollar hit on the U.economy in the first 10 years, and the burdens of the vast majority of these taxes are ultimately borne by patients and consumers in the form of higher costs, larger tax bills, and reduced value in existing health plans and savings accounts.  I know some of my colleagues like to plead ignorance on the notion that taxes on a particular industry tend to be passed along to that industry's consumers, but it is a fact that can't be ignored. Taxes on health insurance plans increase premiums for patients. Taxes on drug companies make drugs more expensive. Taxes on medical device sales increase the costs of those devices.  It is not a complicated concept; it is the natural byproduct of tax provisions negotiated with stakeholders behind closed doors under threat of increased government intrusion and market regulation. These taxes weren't drafted solely to pay the cost of ObamaCare; they were also part of a strategy to get the law through Congress, dividing the business community and pitting industries against one another to prevent widespread opposition. As I said, at the end of the day, it is patients and consumers--individuals and families--who pay most of the freight on these types of tax policies.  Don't take my word for it. Let's look at one major example. Congress's nonpartisan scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, indicated that, by and large, the tax on health insurance premiums would be passed along to health insurance policyholders.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the JCT to Senator Grassley, dated October 28, 2009.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Congress of the United States,                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 2009.     Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.Senate,          Washington,       Dear Ranking Member Grassley: You requested that we provide      you with an analysis of the incidence of the insurance      industry fee provision of 1796, the ``America's Healthy      Future Act,'' our estimate of the effect on the after-tax      price of purchased health insurance, and a distributional      analysis of the provision.                         insurance industry fee       6010 of 1796 would impose an annual fee on any      covered entity engaged in the business of providing health      insurance with respect to United States health risks. Under      the provision, employers who self-insure their employees'      health risks and governmental entities are not covered      entities.       The fee applies for calendar years beginning after 2009.      The aggregate annual fee for all covered entities is $6.7      billion. Under the provision, the aggregate fee is      apportioned among the covered entities based on a ratio      designed to reflect theft relative market share of U.     health business.       For each covered entity, the fee for a calendar year is an      amount that bears the same[[Page S1193]]     ratio to $6.7 billion as (1) the covered entity's net      premiums written during the preceding calendar year with      respect to health insurance for any United States health      risk, bears to (2) the aggregate net premiums written of all      covered entities during such preceding calendar year with      respect to such health insurance.                  incidence of insurance excise taxes       The proposed fee is similar to an excise tax based on the      sales price of health insurance contracts. The effective      excise tax rate varies from year to year depending upon the      aggregate value of health insurance sold. The economic      incidence of an excise tax imposed on sale of health      insurance contracts (that is, who actually bears the cost of      the tax) may differ from the statutory incidence of the tax      (that is, the person on whom the tax is levied). Taxes may be      borne by any of the following: consumers in the form of      higher prices; owners of firms in the form of lower profits;      employees in the form of lower wages; or other suppliers to      firms in the form of lower payments. This makes      generalizations about the incidence of taxes difficult to      make. Nonetheless, two principles have general validity.      First, economic incidence does not depend on whom the tax is      levied. Whether the statutory incidence of the tax is on the      consumer, the employer, or the insurer, the economic      incidence is the same regardless of who writes the check to      the government. Second, taxes are shifted from those who are      more sensitive to price changes (economists describe these      individuals and entities as having more ``elastic'' supply      and demand) to those who are less sensitive to price changes      (those with more ``inelastic'' supply and demand).       In the case of competitive markets, an excise tax generally      is borne entirely by consumers in the form of higher prices      in the long term. An excise tax increases the cost of      producing an additional unit, or incremental cost, of the      taxed good by the amount of the tax. In a competitive market,      market forces cause the after-tax price of a good to equal      the additional cost of producing and selling another unit of      the good. Competition drives the price down to equal the      incremental cost of the provision of the good or service,      including the return to incremental invested capital. If      supply is perfectly responsive to price changes, any price      above incremental cost would induce new firms to enter and      increase production until prices were bid back down to      incremental cost. Similarly, any price below incremental cost      would induce firms to exit or reduce production (because they      would now be losing money selling the taxed good). The      reduction in supply allows prices to increase back up to      incremental cost.       This response may be observed even if some of the      participants in the competitive market do not seek to      maximize profits as their primary objective. Tax-exempt and      nonprofit producers may also pass on the tax as they also      face the increased incremental cost, which they will need to      recover. If they cannot, for example, raise additional funds      from donors, effectively passing the tax on to them, their      alternative is to pass on the tax to consumers in the form of      higher prices.       While consumers are thought to bear the burden of excise      taxes in competitive markets, some may question the degree of      competition in health insurance markets. Recent surveys have      noted that many markets are characterized by the presence of      only a few firms. Additionally, there may exist barriers to      entry in the health insurance market, including multiple      State regulatory requirements, the cost of establishing      health provider networks, health provider network effects      (i.e., the value of a health provider network to consumers      rises with the size of the network), and efficiencies in      risk shifting and risk distribution for large firms.       However, the absence of many competitors does not by itself      imply that there is no competitive pressure on prices. The      threat of potential entrants may provide competitive price      pressure on the existing firms. Furthermore, the option to      self-insure may provide a source of potential competition for      full, purchased insurance, at least for larger firms.       If the insurance industry is not perfectly competitive in a      particular market, the question remains as to what extent an      insurance excise tax would be borne by consumers or producers      in that market. Theoretical analysis has shown that,      depending upon market conditions, the price could increase      by: (1) more than the amount of the tax; (2) exactly the      amount of the tax; or (3) less than the amount of the tax.      Various empirical studies have examined the effect of excise      taxes on prices in less than perfectly competitive markets.      Studies of the tobacco industry suggest that manufacturers      pass on more than the full amount of the tax, while studies      of less than perfectly competitive retail gasoline markets in      rural areas suggest that producers pass on nearly all of the      tax. Even in the rural retail gasoline markets in which gas      stations may be the sole provider of gasoline for many miles      and firms exhibit some pricing power, nearly 95 percent of      the excise tax is still passed on to consumers.       While uncertainty exists, we assume that a very large      portion of the excise tax on purchased insurance will be      borne by consumers in most markets, including in some markets      with a high level of concentration among market participants      covered by the proposed excise tax. In the context of general      health care reform legislation, this assumption is further      supported by the presence of an excise tax on individuals      without minimum essential benefits coverage, which is likely      to make demand for insurance somewhat less sensitive to      changes in price, as consumers will have to buy insurance or      face a penalty. While consumers (or employers) may respond by      changing their insurance coverage from more expensive      coverage to less expensive plans to offset any potential      price increase, this behavior too is properly characterized      as the consumers bearing the burden of the excise tax by      accepting lower quality (for example, a more restricted      physician network) for the same price rather than paying a      higher price for the quality of insurance that they would      prefer if there were no tax. To the extent that firms can      avoid the tax by switching from full insurance to self-     insurance, this may suggest that insurers are unable to pass      on the full cost of the excise tax on purchased insurance.      Increased self-insurance from firms avoiding the excise tax      may increase the cost of this health benefit to employees as      firms that previously chose full insurance, presumably      because it cost less in the absence of the excise tax than      self-insurance, switch to higher cost self-insurance.      Additionally, to the extent that insurers maintain some      pricing power in the administrative services that they      provide self-insurers, the self-insurance market may bear      some of the burden of the excise tax as well.      effect of the fee on the cost of purchased health insurance       The aggregate value of the proposed fee is the same for      each year. The current law baseline for health insurance      premiums projects rising health insurance premiums annually      through the budget period. Consequently the magnitude of the      proposed fee declines annually relative to the sale of health      insurance. Given the incidence analysis discussed above,      while there is imcertainty, we expect a very large portion of      proposed insurance industry fee to be borne by purchasers of      insurance in the form of higher premiums. Our estimate is      that the premiums for purchased health insurance policies,      including the tax liability, would be between 1.0 and 1.5      percent greater than they otherwise would be as a consequence      of the industry fee for calendar years 2010, 2011, and 2012.         distributional analysis of the insurance industry fee       Regardless of the determination of the economic incidence      of the proposed insurance industry fee of 1796, at the      present time the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation is      not able to distribute the effects across individuals on our      individual tax model. The proposed insurance industry fee      would apply only to the revenues from underwritten policies      sold to third parties. It would not apply to the value of      health benefits received by individuals through their      employers who self-insure the health risks of their      employees. Our individual tax model is based upon a sample of      approximately 180,000 actual tax returns. To distribute      proposed tax changes related to economic activity that is not      already reflected on the individual tax return we impute      values or statistically match supplemental information such      as data gathered by the Census Bureau, to the individual tax      returns of our model. For our quantitative analysis of      employer-provided health benefits we have made such      imputations of data relating to employees' employer-provided      health care benefits to the individual model. These      imputations are based on the data collected as part the      Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (``MEPS''), a survey      undertaken by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality      of the Department of Health and Human Services, However, the      imputations we have made to the individual tax model at this      time relate only to the value of employer expenditures for      the health care of their employees. These imputations do not      generally distinguish between the employers' purchased      insurance coverage and benefits for which the employer self-     insures. Consequently, we are unable to distribute either the      economic incidence or the revenues generated from the      proposed fee of 1796, which applies only to purchased      health insurance,       I hope this information is helpful to you. Please contact      me if we can be of further assistance,           Sincerely,                                               Thomas  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,1351,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE BY SECRETARY OF,2017.0,15.0,February
569,topic-id,491,"While we are setting the record straight on ObamaCare, my colleagues on the other side have repeated a particular false claim that needs correction. My Democrat friends are fond of characterizing the repeal of ObamaCare as a tax cut for high-income earners and a tax increase for low- and middle-income taxpayers. That claim is simply false.  According to JCT, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Affordable Care Act imposed significant and widespread tax increases on taxpayers earning less than $200,000 a year, despite President Obama's repeated promises that the law would not do so. In fact, in 2017, a single provision--the reduction in the deductibility of catastrophic losses--is projected to raise taxes on 13.8 million taxpaying families and individuals, mostly from the middle class. That is more than the number of taxpayers who receive exchange credits and other premium subsidies under[[Page S1194]]current law. That is just one example. There are others.  Fortunately, we have been able to forestall the impact of a number of the ObamaCare tax provisions. We have fought and negotiated long and hard to do so, but virtually all of those taxes are still looming on the ObamaCare horizon.  Most of us on the Republican side have been fighting these taxes more or less since the day ObamaCare was signed into law. We have highlighted their harmful impact on the economy and decried the crony capitalism that was behind the effort to draft and enact them.  Given this long history, at least in my view, it is essential that we repeal all of these taxes, along with the rest of It is difficult to imagine how Republicans, who are now in the majority in large part due to the promises we made to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, can now sift through ObamaCare's taxes and decide which ones are the least objectionable so that we can use them to pay for our own healthcare reforms.  ObamaCare isn't problematic simply because healthcare costs are not going up; it was fundamentally flawed at the outset. The way the law was drafted was, and still is, a problem. The way the law was negotiated--with stakeholders being played against each other--was, and still is, a problem. Of course, the way the law was paid for was, and still is, a problem. The ObamaCare taxes are a big part of this equation. In my view--and, I think, the view of the vast majority of my Republican colleagues--they have to go.  As I said, there really are not widespread disagreements among Republicans on these issues. Overall, we broadly agree on the fundamental issues surrounding ObamaCare, and, as I noted last week, it is not all that problematic to have some differences of opinion on the initial stage, so long as we can overcome those differences in the end. I think we can do that. More importantly, I think we will.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lee).

Two dozen State attorneys general wrote to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in support of Mr.Pruitt's nomination. He has been endorsed by a wide variety of organizations representing a broad swath of America culture and industry, including the U.Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Home Builders, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Western Energy Alliance, and the Western Growers Association, just to name a few.  In his capacity as State attorney general, Mr.Pruitt has consistently fought against Federal intrusion on State and individual liberties, and he has shown himself to be a thoughtful attorney who is dedicated to the Constitution and to the rule of law.

For too long, the Agency has strayed from its core mission of protecting human health and the environment. For too long, it has imposed draconian regulations that cause undue harm to America's small businesses and rural communities.  I have long held that the EPA can fulfill its vitally important mission of protecting the environment without causing unnecessary harm to the economy, but to achieve this objective will require a massive culture change at the Agency--a culture change that only Mr.Pruitt can bring.

1521,topic-id,2305,"Mr.President, 70 years ago this May, the Senate Appropriations Committee sent to the full Senate a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget. It had been proposed by Senator Millard Tydings, a Democrat from In its report, the committee said this: ``In no other way except by an amendment to the Constitution can Congress be compelled to balance its budget in peacetime.''  Seven decades of experience proved that the Appropriations Committee was right, and we have never been in a more serious, perilous situation than we are today.  Two essential facts compel me once again to introduce a constitutional amendment to require fiscal responsibility: the gravity of the national debt crisis and the fact that neither willpower nor legislation will solve it.  The greatest challenge in describing the gravity of the national debt crisis is deciding how much of the bad news to present at one time. During the 2008 Presidential campaign, one of the candidates criticized the outgoing President for adding $4 trillion to the national debt. That increase, Barack Obama said, was not only irresponsible but ``unpatriotic.'' The national debt on inauguration day 2009 was $10.6 trillion, and on inauguration day 2017 it was $19.9 trillion. If a $4 trillion increase was irresponsible and unpatriotic, what words describe a $9.3 trillion increase?  President Obama won the 2008 election with the Government Accountability Office warning that the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook was unsustainable. In its January 2017 assessment of the Nation's fiscal health, GAO reports that the national debt as a share of GDP in 2016 was 75 percent higher than the average since World War As it had been before, GAO concluded that ``the federal government's fiscal path is unsustainable.''  One way to understand the gravity of the national debt is to compare it to the size of the economy, or the gross domestic product. In other words, we can compare what we owe to our ability to pay. When President Obama took office, the national debt was 82 percent of GDP and is now 105 percent of GDP today. Some economists prefer to evaluate the national debt as a percentage of tax revenue; that is, by comparing what we owe to what we earn. The national debt rose from approximately 350 percent of Federal revenue when President Obama took office to 600 percent of Federal revenue today.  But neither numbers nor percentages tell the whole story because the national debt crisis is becoming not only a bigger crisis but a different kind of crisis. During the last several years of skyrocketing national debt, the interest rate on that debt has been nearly zero. If interest rates had been at the historical average, annual interest costs would be more than twice what they are today and on their way to consuming more than half of all Federal revenue. And now interest rates are starting to creep up. The Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget both anticipate that over the next decade, interest payments on the national debt alone will approach $1 trillion per year. That is interest payments. In other words, as GAO found in its new fiscal report, the growing national debt now means that the rising cost of servicing that debt becomes one of the drivers of the growing debt itself. This is becoming what one study calls a self-propelling crisis.  A national debt of this magnitude dampens the economic growth necessary to minimize borrowing to fund the government, and rising interest costs for such a monstrous debt add to the debt on which more interest must then be paid. Last month, for instance, the Treasury Department echoed this point in its financial report with the U.Government for fiscal year 2016. The Treasury Department concluded:       The debt-to-GDP ratio rises at an accelerating rate despite      primary deficits that flatten out because higher levels of      debt lead to higher net interest expenditures, and higher net      interest expenditures lead to[[Page S1451]]     higher debt. The continuous rise of the debt-to-GDP ratio . .      . indicates that current policy is unsustainable.  We can also consider the legislative budget and economic outlook from the Congressional Budget I want to highlight a few things that stood out to me.  First, annual budget deficits are on their way back up after 6 years of decline. In fact, the budget deficit for fiscal year 2016 will be one-third larger than in 2015.  Second, CBO projects that the national debt will rise by nearly $10 trillion over the next decade. Looking beyond the next decade, CBO says that under current law, the national debt will explode to more than 150 percent of GDP--by far the highest level in American history.  Third, CBO also says that interest on the national debt is itself an increasingly forceful engine driving the debt even higher. Interest payments on the national debt are increasing nearly twice as fast as spending on Social Security and Just last month, CBO Director Keith Hall said that over the next 10 years, interest payments are expected to triple in nominal terms and double relative to  Fourth, CBO repeated some of the serious negative consequences of this national debt for the budget, the economy, and the In addition to substantially higher interest payments, these include lower productivity and wages, less flexibility by lawmakers to respond to fiscal challenges, and increased likelihood of a fiscal crisis.  In addition to these problems, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael Mullen and experts from the Heritage Foundation to the Brookings Institution warn that the national debt crisis is a serious threat to national security.  Economists tell us that national debt above 90 percent of GDP for a sustained period of time will lead to substantially slower economic growth and higher interest rates. The United States is now in the longest period in its history with the national debt above that toxic 90-percent level. Not surprisingly, since the recession ended in June 2009, the national debt has grown more than twice as fast and GDP has grown less than half as fast as during the comparable period after previous recessions.  It is no wonder to me and to many others that more than two-thirds of Americans say that their concern over the national debt is growing and more than three-quarters of Americans say that the national debt should be among Congress's top three priorities. The national debt was once such a top priority. In fact, America's Founders were so determined to avoid debt that their commitment to fiscal balance was often called our unwritten fiscal constitution. President George Washington, for example, told Congress that the regular redemption of the public debt was the most urgent fiscal priority. That was George Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1798 that if he could add a single amendment to the Constitution, it would prohibit the Federal Government from borrowing. That commitment, of course, is long gone. The Federal budget has been balanced in only a dozen of the last 80 years. And, as I said earlier, we are in the longest period in American history with a debt above 90 percent of  As its fiscal willpower failed, Congress has also tried to address the debt crisis by legislation. The first bill requiring a balanced budget was introduced in 1934 when the national debt was 40 percent of Fifty years later, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Since then, we have enacted multiple budget control acts and budget enforcement acts, only to see the national debt climb from 42 percent of GDP in 1985 to 105 percent of GDP today.  Good intentions will not balance the Nation's checkbook. Statutes that Congress can change or ignore will not keep our fiscal house in order. Neither willpower nor legislation will tackle the national debt crisis. Pretending otherwise is the fiscal equivalent of fiddling while Rome burns.  All the evidence--every bit of it--proves true the conclusion drawn by the Appropriations Committee 70 years ago. In no other way except by amendment to the Constitution can Congress be compelled to balanced its budget in peacetime. We have, as lawyers put it, exhausted our other remedies for this crisis. This would be a very different country--a freer and more prosperous country--if Congress had already proposed the only solution that exists, a constitutional amendment which requires fiscal responsibility.  The first balanced budget amendment was introduced in the House of Representatives in 1936. As you can see, the national debt as a percentage of GDP has been going up by leaps and bounds. I introduced my first balanced budget amendment in June of 1979, during my first term in the Senate when the national debt was 32 percent of That share of GDP doubled by 1997 when the Senate came within one vote of passing a balanced budget amendment that I introduced--one vote. It rose to 95 percent when the Senate last voted on a balanced budget amendment in 2011 and is 105 percent of GDP today.  Since this crisis is already so grave and getting worse, since the only way to tackle it is through the Constitution, we should propose a balanced budget amendment and let the American people decide whether to take this step. After all, Congress cannot amend the A requirement that Congress keep its fiscal house in order cannot become part of the Constitution until that is approved by three-quarters of the  Congress, however, is not the only way to propose constitutional amendments. Article V of the Constitution also allows the States to apply for a convention to propose constitutional amendments. Concerned citizens have been working since the mid-1970s to reach the two-thirds threshold for calling such a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment and are only six States away from that goal. Since Congress has never called an article V convention, questions remain unresolved and theories untested regarding that method of proposing an amendment. I can assure my colleagues, however, that Congress's continued failure to propose a balanced budget--and a balanced budget amendment at that--guarantees that our fellow citizens will continue working to force that course upon us.  There are two facts that we must face: the gravity of the nation's debt crisis and the failure to address it by willpower or legislation. Perhaps some of my colleagues believe that the Congressional Budget Office is wrong in its disturbing projections and dire warnings; that the Government Accountability Office is mistaken and the fiscal path we are on is sustainable after all; that the Treasury Department is wrong about the spiral of increased debt and growing interest payments--some people feel that way; that the Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget are wrong about how national debt interest payments will continue to grow and add to the debt; and that economists are wrong to warn about the impact of sustained national debt of this magnitude.  If my colleagues are convinced that everyone else is wrong and our fiscal future is just fine after all, then they should say so and then try to make that case to the American people. Even they will not do that because they know they are wrong, yet we can't seem to get them to do what is right. I, for one, think that would be a very tough sell for them to make. Americans have been polled about this issue dozens of times over the years by major polling firms and national news organizations. Three-quarters of Americans supported a balanced budget amendment in 1976, and three-quarters support it today.  Perhaps all of these polls over the last 40 years are wrong. Perhaps the American people are content watching their national debt swallow the economy. Perhaps our fellow citizens are actually OK with slower economic growth, a rising threat to national security, the greater likelihood of a fiscal crisis, and an unsustainable path to fiscal disaster. If that is what the American people actually believe, then they certainly are inclined to ratify a balanced budget amendment.  The real reason Members of Congress refuse to give the American people this choice is that they know what the American people will say. I say with respect, but as strongly as I can, that this is not a legitimate basis for refusing to propose a balanced budget[[Page S1452]]amendment. In our system of government, as Founder James Wilson once put it, the people are the masters of government. They alone have authority to set rules for government. This choice must be theirs, not ours.  Here is the heart of the matter. First, the national debt crisis poses a significant and growing threat to the economic and national security of this country. In fact, we have never been in such an extended, perilous period as we are right now. Second, Congress has tried and failed to address this crisis by either willpower or legislation and will actually do so only if the Constitution requires it. Third, the decision of whether to use the Constitution to require fiscal responsibility belongs to the American people, not to  We can either take the responsibility we were elected for and propose a balanced budget amendment or the American people may do it for us. I hope we have the guts to do what is right. Our very country is hanging in the balance. The rest of the world depends on the United States and the strong principles of the United States, and we need to do what is right.  I think it is time for us to wake up and realize this is the Congress that can make the difference. After all these years of impropriety and excessive spending, we can do it. We can live within certain constraints. It may take a period of time to wind this down, but we can do it. This amendment does provide for some ways of getting there.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-27-pt1-PgS1449.txt,1351,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE BY SECRETARY OF,2017.0,27.0,February
19,topic-id,618,"Mr.Speaker, it may be Valentine's Day, but I rise today to share a story of a Christmas miracle.  Now, this is little Gracie, and she was born on Christmas Day in 2015. Unfortunately, not too long after she was born, she was diagnosed with a respiratory virus. It is a very bad thing for little people because they have little lungs and little respiratory airways. Frankly, it can be extremely dangerous.  To make matters worse, she was snowed in at the hospital where she was born. She had to spend 5 days at the NICU before they could transport her to a children's hospital. When she finally did arrive at Seattle Children's Hospital, she had pneumonia, coli, and a collapsed lung. But, fortunately, little Gracie is a fighter, as was her medical team, and she made a complete and full recovery.  With coverage through Medicaid, her parents were able to focus on her care and her future. The financial stress of hospital bills that come with intensive care, a cardiac catheter, a life flight, and numerous medications was daunting, but it was not devastating.  Gracie's story is just one example of the difference Medicaid expansion through the ACA has made for millions of children throughout our  Mr.Speaker, when I am home, I hear these stories all day long about how the ACA has made a real difference in the lives of people. The ACA in my State expanded coverage to more than 750,000 people. In fact, this January, we hit record enrollment of 225,000 sign-ups. That is a 13 percent jump from last year.  The ACA is working for many people across America; but let's be honest: we have also heard the other stories from people who aren't seeing these gains. Instead, they are seeing higher premiums and increased medical costs in general, with little improvement in coverage. Those are legitimate concerns that Congress needs to address.  But whenever Congress makes major changes, such as Social Security or Medicare, or enacts big ideas, there will always be unexpected results in parts of the program that don't function as anticipated or designed. Our job is to follow up, see what works, and adapt accordingly going forward. Even the best laws are going to require some adjustment.  Let's do that. Let's do it the smart way, the American way, and work together to fix the parts of the ACA that need fixing while maintaining that which works. Repeal and replace is not the answer. It is not the answer. Working together to fix it is the answer.  As we continue--or begin--to work together, I hope we will remember Gracie and know that health care is not a miracle.

1170,topic-id,1077,"Madam President, on August 5, 2015, 3 million gallons of acid mine drainage laden with heavy metals and other contaminants were released into Cement Creek by an Environmental Protection Agency contractor investigating contamination at the Gold King Mine in San Juan County,  Contaminated water flowed down Cement Creek, down the Animas River, and into the San Juan River, resulting in water use restrictions and emergency responses in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, the Southern Ute Reservation, and the Navajo We need only look at the photos of the bright orange water streaming through these various drainages to see how terrible this spill was for the affected communities and for water users. The Gold King Mine spill placed a heavy burden on States, tribes, local governments, and communities, and the spill hurt businesses, farmers, and ranchers throughout the region.  Since the spill, I have visited impacted residents and communities and worked closely with local, State, and tribal leaders to make sure water is monitored for contaminants, and costs from the spill are repaid.  Last year, I was proud to help pass a measure in Congress which will ensure that State and local and tribal governments will be fully reimbursed for their emergency response costs and which establishes a long-term water quality monitoring program in cooperation with local stakeholders.  However, on January 13 of this year, the EPA and Department of Justice issued an outrageous decision that the EPA is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for damages to water users caused by this Gold King Mine spill. This decision represents a broken promise from the EPA that it would fully address this environmental disaster.  Now, while the agency has taken steps is to clean up the mine, no farmer in New Mexico or on the Navajo Nation has received a dime of compensation, and distrust of the government has understandably deepened across the Four Corners region.  During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works last month, President Trump's nominee to run the EPA, Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, said that he would review the Agency's decision not to make payments to claimants affected by this spill.  If he is confirmed as EPA Administrator, Mr.Pruitt must take immediate steps to restore trust among the people of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, the Southern Ute Tribe, and the Navajo Nation, who have already waited far too long for the EPA to keep its promise and compensate them for the harm that has been caused.  I will hold Mr.Pruitt accountable for cleaning up toxic, abandoned hard-rock mines in the West, such as Gold King, and I will hold him accountable for making sure the water that New Mexico communities and farmers rely on is safe.  We shouldn't wait for more disasters to strike. New Mexico communities deserve full and complete protection for their land, their water, and their livelihoods.  Unfortunately, I have real reason to doubt Mr.Pruitt will take this responsibility and core mission of the EPA seriously in his new role. As the attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt has built a long track record that is antithetical to the EPA's core mission to keep our Nation's land, water, and air clean. Mr.Pruitt repeatedly fought against the EPA as it implemented measures to safeguard our clean air and clean water.  Rather than protecting the health of Oklahoma families, he has filed lawsuits against the EPA to stop rules that would have reduced smog and soot crossing State lines, protected against emissions of mercury, arsenic, acid gases, and other toxic pollutants from power plants, and improved air quality in national parks and wilderness areas.  Mr.Pruitt has shown little regard for the safety of our drinking water, filing a lawsuit to stop the EPA's clean water rule, which would protect the natural filtering system that supplies drinking water to one out of every three  Mr.Pruitt sent a letter to the EPA opposing even preliminary research into the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on our water resources. Mr.Pruitt has been a friend to polluters, helping them to use his office as a conduit for their special interests. He has sent letters on official letterhead to the EPA, the Department of the Interior, the Office of Management and Budget, and even to the President of the United States, copied and pasted nearly verbatim from language written by industry lobbyists.  Perhaps most damning of all, Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly denied the scientific consensus on the human influence on climate change, including in an op-ed recently published in May of last year. It takes a willful disregard for data-driven science to ignore the increase in extreme weather events that we are now seeing on a regular basis, thanks to climate change.  Just last Saturday in Mangum, OK, an all-time record of 99 degrees Fahrenheit was set on February 11. Imagine that; 99 degrees in the heart of winter. Folks, I wish I were making this up, but no snowball on the floor of the Senate can erase these facts.  It was Mr.Pruitt, the Attorney General of Oklahoma, who sued the EPA to prevent measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the very cause of climate change. Americans need a leader at the EPA who will take action on climate change, and we need someone who is guided in their decisions by the best available science.  I have heard from thousands of New Mexicans who have made a strong case that Mr.Pruitt is not the right person for this job. I will not vote to confirm Scott But I will say that if my colleagues move forward with this nomination, they can be sure that we will hold Mr.Pruitt accountable for decisions that hurt the health of New Mexico families. That includes making sure Mr.Pruitt rights the wrongs inflicted on communities in the Four Corners region by the Gold King Mine spill.

958,topic-id,1496,"Mr.President, I join my colleagues today to recognize that the environment is critically important. One of the true issues States face is getting back to the promises of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act to make sure States enjoy primacy, and I think that is a critical component that is not being discussed today as we look at guaranteed clean water and clean air--making sure that those closest to those issues have the ability to have the input that was anticipated by almost every environmental statute. So I would remind my colleagues that when we focus many times on Federal issues and Federal appointments, one of the most important things that we can do is focus on the fact that these Federal agency heads need to work cooperatively with State organizations.  Scott Pruitt, who is a soon-to-be former attorney general, understands the State role, and I think that is a critical qualification and an important distinction to make.

Putting Americans back to work in manufacturing is one of the most critical things that we can do in the Senate, making sure that our people have an opportunity to succeed, participate, and have an opportunity to produce goods and services that can be exported and can grow the wealth of our country and grow the economy of our country.  Last week I joined President Trump in a small bipartisan lunch. We had a chance to talk about a variety of issues. There are very many issues that divide us, but this issue unites us. I specifically talked with the President about the need to get the Export-Import Bank up and running. I also talked to him about the Export-Import Bank in December and talked about the importance of enabling this institution to function for the American manufacturing worker. The great news is that President Trump agrees, and he informed me that we can in fact say he supports the Ex-Im Bank and that he would be nominating someone soon to serve on the Export-Import  That led off a rash of discussion among the usual naysayers with the Ex-Im Bank, mostly driven by ideology and not fact.

There has been a lot of talk about supporting the economy and boosting American manufacturing jobs, but all that talk falls on deaf ears if we don't take action on the simple issues when we can accomplish those goals, and that simple issue is enabling the Export-Import Bank to function. For decades the Export-Import Bank has leveled the playing field for American workers and businesses. Yet heavy politics is enabling one Senator to put political ideology before the jobs and well-being of thousands of American workers across our country.  We worked very, very hard in 2015. We knew that we were going to be challenged to get the Ex-Im Bank reauthorized. In June of 2015, the Export-Import Bank expired and did not have a charter. It was not authorized for the first time in its more than 80-year history. I fought very hard to reauthorize it, as did a number of my colleagues. Finally, in December 2016, 6 months later, the Bank was given a charter, given an authorization. I want to point out something because I think way too often we think what stops this endeavor is partisan politics. Guess what. Over 70 percent of the House of Representatives voted for the Ex-Im Bank and over 60 percent of the Senate voted for the Ex-Im This is not a partisan issue. There is bipartisan support. Yet there is a narrow group of people who would rather put ideology ahead of American jobs. It is wrong on so many levels.  Despite the fact, unfortunately, that we finally authorized the Ex-Im Bank over a year ago with overwhelming support, we do not have a Bank that can authorize any credits over $10 million. That is because it requires a quorum of Bank board members to make that decision. We only have two out of the five members of the board. That means that we don't have a quorum. So what has been happening is that there is $30 billion--think about that, $30 billion--of American exports waiting in the queue, waiting for approval, hoping desperately to get the[[Page S1243]]Ex-Im Bank up and running so those exports can receive the credit they need and receive the guarantees that those exports need and get people back to work.  Do you know what else has been happening since we haven't had a quorum on the Bank? Thousands of American jobs have been transported to places like France and We are losing thousands of jobs.  When I hear people say the Ex-Im Bank is the bank of Boeing or the bank of GE, trust me, I do not bleed for the executives of I do not bleed for the executives of They will do fine. In fact, they know how to get around this problem. They just move those manufacturing jobs to a country that will recognize the exports and will provide that export credit. That is what is happening. But guess what is happening to the American worker and families across these manufacturing facilities? They are getting pink slips. Why? Because this body refuses to give us a quorum on the Ex-Im  The President understands this. The President understands how important it is to get these American workers back together. Now I want you just to think about what $30 billion of exports is worth to American employment. If we use the numbers that extrapolate, it is hard to know, but it is over 170,000 jobs. Think about the fact that 170,000 jobs are waiting in the wings for us to do the right thing. When we move forward with the Ex-Im Bank, I think we will have a good day--a good bipartisan day when the President of the United States joins with those of us who care about workers and manufacturing in this country--and we will get the Ex-Im Bank up and running. I think if we fail to do it and if we fail to send the signals that help is coming and that the Ex-Im Bank is going to be an effective institution that will once again play a role in American manufacturing and will be in that tool chest of trade opportunities--if we don't do it--then they are going to give up all hope, and they are going to find some other place to manufacture the products that will allow them to access the credit, that will allow them to sell their products overseas. So it is critically important.  I want to leave with one statistic. The Peterson Institute recently estimated that the United States is losing $50 million in exports for every day that a nomination is not confirmed--$50 million of new wealth creation for our country. It is a travesty.  Of all of the things I have seen here--the callous things--that sound so bureaucratic when you talk about the Ex-Im Bank, when you pick up the curtain and you look underneath, what we see are American jobs and American families and American opportunity and new wealth creation for our country and economic growth for our country. And because some institution that could give you a black mark in a political campaign says ``We don't like it,'' it doesn't get done. Shame on us.  Thank you to the President for agreeing to help us move the Ex-Im Bank forward. Thank you to all of my colleagues--64 in the last Congress--who stood with us to get the Ex-Im Bank reauthorized and the over 70 percent of the House of Representatives, on a stand-alone vote, who voted for the Ex-Im Bank, who know how critically important this is. We can get this job done, and we can stop the migration of these jobs to other countries.  I look forward to hearing more this week and hopefully early next week from the As a member of the Banking Committee, I look forward to pushing for a hearing and a vote on this nominee. And I look forward to the day that all of these exporters and these American workers can see that this institution can work for them, and that will be the day that those credits are approved at the Ex-Im  Thank you so much, Mr. I yield the floor.

It is an honor to be in the historic House Chamber where every day the distinguished lawgivers in our history look down on this George Mason, who wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights, looks down on the Speaker's dais, as does Thomas Jefferson, the author of our Declaration of  No speaker stands at the dais and addresses the people's House without the steely gaze of Moses, the ultimate, most revered lawmaker, Mr.He looks down on you and on this Chamber for truth and justice.  Mr.Speaker, we Americans work hard. We work hard every day of the week, and we love We love Fridays so much that we say: Thank God it's Over the years, TGIF has become not only something that everyone in our country who works hard recognizes, but it became the name of a popular restaurant.  In the autumn, we love our Friday nights watching high school football. In the winter, maybe it is catching a movie and eating a pizza with our friends or family. In the spring, Friday can find us catching a baseball game, the American pastime.  Mr.Speaker, last Friday night, I was in Cairo, Egypt, and what I saw was that same joyous, happy experience of families sharing their successes of the week; celebrating a great soccer victory; clapping to wonderful, warm local music; and witnessing the squealing of their kids running around their parents, celebrating a birthday or just a good week at work or school.  The streets of the Khan el-Khalili Bazaar in Cairo were chock-full last Friday, Mr.Speaker, with the living and the loving, just going about that weekly experience pursuing their own version of happiness and  Friday night in Cairo, the land of the Pharaoh, the land of the beginning of much of human education and civilization, there was dining and bargaining in the bizarre that has been the centerpiece of trading and manufacturing and merchandising for half a millennia.  Mr.Speaker, my trip to Egypt was marked not just with witnessing the joy of Egyptian family life and seeing and sharing what we have in common. It was a reminder that the 91 million Egyptians are on the front line of the global war on terror, a war that unites the leadership of Egypt and the United States arm-in-arm to design and implement the most effective strategies we can to defeat the malevolent evil enemy of ISIS, al-Qaida, Boko Haram, and their bloody cohorts across the globe.  In my view, after the approach of the past 8 years, our enemies are stronger and engaged more broadly than ever before. Nothing has driven this point home more than a visit in Cairo to the Peter and Paul's Coptic  Located on the plaza adjacent to the offices of His Holiness Coptic Pope Tawadros II, there was joy there last Saturday morning, Mr.Speaker, listening to the chants of the priests, the reverence of the families in the pews, the kids again squealing and smiling in their parents' arms.  But, Mr.Speaker, on the periphery of that joy was a stark reminder of the destruction there on December 11, when a male ISIS jihadist suicide bomber entered that church disguised as a woman and detonated his vest, murdering 25, mostly women, splattering the walls and the floors of God's House with their blood.  As I walked through that same entrance last Saturday, Mr.Speaker, the church has developed a reverent shrine to those who were lost. The pockmarks in the marble are there from the shrapnel from the vest.                              {time}  1800  But that church is a symbol of unity in Egypt, not division, as it was visited by President el-Sisi, a devout Muslim leader of all Egyptians, who came to share his concern, his affection for Egyptians no matter what their religious background. Best summarized by the wise Pope of the Coptic church--Mr.Speaker, we have to remind ourselves that the word ``Coptic,'' of course, comes from the Greek word ``aigyptios,'' which means The Coptic church is as old as Mark's arrival in Alexandria in the first century.  That wise old Pope told us, and I think really, Mr.Speaker, captured the whole spirit of the Egyptian people and the resolve that is taking place in that country under President el-Sisi when he said, Egyptians take two things from the Nile River on which they have lived some 5,000 years. They take water, and they take moderation in their beliefs.  Mr.Speaker, tonight I wanted to come to the House Chamber and pay tribute to the Egyptian people for being on those front lines in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism, pay tribute to the Christian and Muslim people of Egypt working together to defeat this ideology. I want to commend President el-Sisi for his courageous leadership in the Muslim world.[[Page H1296]]  Coinciding with the birthday celebration of the Prophet Muhammad on New Year's Day 2015, President el-Sisi went to the Islamic world's most respected institution, Al-Azhar University, and called upon the world's 1.6 billion faithful Muslims and the faith's imams to support a religious revolution. He called on the leaders to reject the mindset of death and jihad.  Mr.Speaker, in both Egypt and America, we come from dust and to dust we shall return. We are made in God's image, and God has granted us such unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. While we are breathing, each of us has an obligation to serve our fellow man, work to value our societies and make them the best that they can be.  In January, we witnessed a change in leadership here in the United We had a former President who grew up in Hawaii and grew up riding the waves in He rode a wave into the White House and then drifted along, bobbing on top of those waves for 8 years. Now, Mr.Speaker, we have a President in the White House who is not riding the waves; he is making waves. It is my hope that he will execute a new direction and take new actions to win the global war on terrorism.  I have to say, Mr.Speaker, whether it takes 3 months or 30 years, I won't rest until we unify the civilized world to reject jihad, reject the terror we saw at Peter and Paul's Church in Mr.Speaker, we need to condemn those who condone it. We need to condemn those who finance it. We need to reject it when we see it taught in the mosque. We need to reject it on We need to reject it in the media. We must condemn those who say it is wrong but stand silent.  Mr.Speaker, there are no bystanders in this fight, and there is no substitute for victory.

588,topic-id,1235,"Mr.President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, is probably the most powerful Federal job that most Americans have never heard of. If you were to ask five out of five regular people whether they have even heard of the Office of Management and Budget, or its importance, I would say that probably five of them would say: I have never heard of it; what do they do?  The Director of OMB has broad discretion to develop Federal regulations and to set spending priorities across the government--spending priorities across the government. I think we should make sure that this person actually cares about service to the people of  For example, if the Defense Department needs more resources for our troops, OMB has to sign off. If the Environmental Protection Agency wants to protect our communities from air and water pollution, OMB has to sign off. If the President wants to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid under the guise of ``saving money,'' the OMB Director is responsible for implementing the policy.  Given the tremendous power invested in this position, the next OMB Director should, at a minimum, believe in the[[Page S1214]]central government functions he or she will be tasked to carry out. That is why I strongly oppose the nomination of Congressman Mike Mulvaney to serve as the next Director of the Office of Management and  Congressman Mulvaney came to Washington at the very right fringe of the tea party wave in 2010. Since then, he has consistently pursued policies that would be disastrous for our economy, for the most vulnerable members of our society, and for America's seniors--our kupuna.  Congressman Mulvaney has been one of the strongest proponents for privatizing and voucherizing Medicare and dismantling Medicaid during his time in In 2011, while explaining his support for the draconian, really terrible Republican budget that would have destroyed the social safety net and gutted funding for nearly every domestic program--nearly every domestic program and you can imagine the thousands and thousands of domestic programs people across the country are relying upon--Congressman Mulvaney said:       Two nights ago, there was a group of Republicans in the      House of Representatives who voted to dramatically overhaul      Medicare and Medicaid and lightning did not strike us. If      that is not a sign that maybe things can be different around      here, I don't know what is. So I'm hoping that--I hope we      have that exact debate over the course of the next year.  Let me be clear. Congressman Mulvaney was gloating over a bill that would be devastating to millions of seniors and Americans on Medicaid and If confirmed, Congressman Mulvaney would not just be one extremist in the House of Representatives; he would be the person--the one person--responsible for developing, rolling out, and implementing the President's budget and his priorities.  With this power, he would be in a position to fulfill his heart's desire--all of the things he worked on as a member of the tea party and a Member of the House of He could destroy programs like Medicare and Social Security, which more than 200,000 seniors in Hawaii and tens of millions across the United States depend on every single day. There are things we can do to fight back.  Last month, I fought alongside my friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator Joe Donnelly, to prevent Congressman Mulvaney and the Trump administration from using budget gimmicks to privatize Medicare and cut funding from While our amendment was defeated in a very close vote, I was encouraged that two of our Republican colleagues--Senator Dean Heller of Nevada and Senator Susan Collins of Maine--voted in favor of my amendment.  This vote demonstrated that there is bipartisan opposition to balancing the budget on the backs of our seniors. This is exactly what Congressman Mulvaney wants to do. He has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes are illegal, but he calls Social Security--a program that millions and millions of people throughout our country rely upon--a Ponzi scheme and supports raising the eligibility for it to 70 years old.  When he was in the South Carolina legislature, he even supported a bill that said that Social Security was unconstitutional. I would say even the most conservative person would not deem Social Security to be unconstitutional, but that is the kind of position that Congressman Mulvaney takes. His positions on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are enough to disqualify him from serving as OMB  We do not need an ideological flamethrower like Congressman Mulvaney at the helm of Sadly, there is more. Congressman Mulvaney is a debt limit denier. To demonstrate the point, I wish to read his response to a question he received from the Budget Committee:       I do believe that defaulting on America's debts would have      grave worldwide economic consequences. I do not believe that      breaching the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably      lead to that result.  Not only is this statement wrong, but it contradicts itself. I was in the House in 2011 when Congressman Mulvaney and his colleagues played political games with the debt limit. I can tell you that the stock market did not agree with his assessment that there wouldn't be an immediate negative impact.  Here is what happened over the course of a week. The stock market lost $1 trillion in value--$1 trillion in value. Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.credit for the first time in our country's history.  The Government Accountability Office later found that the standoff increased our borrowing costs by $1.3 billion, which Congressman Mulvaney and his Republican allies were all too happy to pass along to the American taxpayers to pay.  Congressman Mulvaney's record clearly demonstrates why he is unfit to serve as the Director of the Office of Management and He wants to balance the budget on the backs of seniors and other vulnerable communities. He believes in governing from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis. It isn't even clear if he supports the mission of the department he has been nominated to lead.  Congressman Mulvaney joins a list of nominees--many of them confirmed at this point, sadly--ranging from an Education Secretary who does not believe in public education to a Secretary of Health and Human Services who wants to basically dismantle Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security not far behind.  I ask my colleagues, when does this long list of nominees come to a stop? I say, at the very least, someone with the power of the Director of OMB is where we should be drawing the line, unless we want one who thinks that defaulting on our national debt is not a problem, unless we think that hurting millions and millions of seniors on Social Security and Medicare is not a problem.  I feel as though Congressman Mulvaney perhaps has not encountered enough people in his time in public service who have come to him to share their stories of the devastation that would come into their lives if these safety net programs were not there for them. I feel as though maybe if they have come to talk to him, he hasn't listened very well.  I encourage my colleagues to hold the line at this point and to oppose this nomination. Congressman Mulvaney is not the person for  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1147,topic-id,1110,"Madam President, no one wants to live on a dirty planet. Before we created the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, nearly 50 years ago, rivers actually caught fire from pollution, smog covered our cities, and powerplants spewed arsenic[[Page S1378]]and mercury into the sky with impunity.  In the years since, the EPA has been at the vanguard of the effort to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.  This work is not easy, and the person who leads the EPA has a tough job. It requires toughness and fortitude to fight back against polluters and special interests.  In all the years the EPA has been around, we would be hard-pressed to find someone more hostile to the Agency's fundamental mission or as less suited to leading it than Scott Pruitt is.  As Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr.Pruitt organized, led, or participated in virtually every challenge to the EPA's work during his time in office. His lawsuits have, among other things, sought to prevent the EPA from enforcing rules that keep our water safe, protect our air from harmful pollutants, like mercury and arsenic, and limit the carbon pollution that causes climate change.  These lawsuits beg the question: Does Scott Pruitt believe the EPA should even exist? In the weeks and months since he was nominated, Mr.Pruitt has gone out of his way to try and smooth over his record and say what he thinks we want to hear, but we can't fall for it.  Instead of listening to what he is saying now, let's examine more closely what he has done as Oklahoma's attorney general.  His record is troubling. Throughout his term of office, Mr.Pruitt has been very cozy with fossil fuel companies and affiliated interest groups.  A 2014 investigation by the New York Times revealed that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr.Pruitt to send on State stationary to the EPA against the Obama administration's environmental regulations.  The CEO of Continental Energy--an oil and gas company based in Oklahoma--served as the campaign chairman for his reelection bid. We just got word yesterday that a State district judge in Oklahoma ordered the attorney general's office to turn over as many as 3,000 documents related to Mr.Pruitt's communications with oil, gas, and coal groups during his time in office. Unfortunately, we will not get a chance to see what these documents reveal before voting on his confirmation.  Based on his record and associations, however, I think we can make an educated guess that these documents will reveal the extent of Mr.Pruitt's ties to fossil fuel interests, and we have no reason to believe he will renounce these connections if confirmed to serve as EPA  He also fought relentlessly against the EPA's efforts to establish basic limits on smog, arsenic, mercury, and other dangerous air pollutants.  Mr.Pruitt, for example, sued the EPA not once but twice to overturn the Mercury and Air Toxics These standards would prevent 40,000 pounds of mercury emissions every year and would help keep our food supply safe from contamination.  Mr.Pruitt has also repeatedly questioned whether climate change is real.  In an op-ed in the Washington Times, Mr.Pruitt refused to accept settled science that humans contribute to climate change. He said there are ``a wide range of viewpoints regarding the extent to which man contributes to climate change.''  In the National Review, Mr.Pruitt said ``scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming.''  The fact is, 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is real and that human beings contribute to it. I hardly think 97 percent of scientists agreeing constitutes a wide range of viewpoints on climate change and the extent to which man contributes to it.  From his perch as Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr.Pruitt sued to prevent President Obama's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from taking effect. He argued that the Federal Government doesn't have the authority to regulate carbon emissions. This is wrong.  The Supreme Court ruled twice--first in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 and again in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA in 2014--that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon emissions as pollution under the Clean Air  If confirmed, Mr.Pruitt has promised to kill the Clean Power Plan and undo much of the positive work that President Obama did to address climate change.  Mr.Pruitt also has a track record of undermining enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. Shortly after becoming Oklahoma's attorney general in 2010, Mr.Pruitt gave us a taste of what is to come at the EPA when he eliminated the Environmental Protection Unit within the Oklahoma attorney general's office.  For years, this unit investigated water contamination from refineries, lead paint waste, and illegal dumping. In its place, he created the innocuous sounding Federalism Unlike the unit he eliminated, whose mission was to protect the health and safety of Oklahomans, the Federalism Unit's job is to handle all of Mr.Pruitt's legal challenges against the Over the past 3 years, Mr.Pruitt has increased the budget of the Federalism Unit by over 700 percent, and the taxpayers of Oklahoma get to foot that bill.  Mr.Pruitt's record paints a clear picture: His priorities directly conflict with the EPA's mission to protect public health and the environment. He is much more concerned about protecting corporate interests than keeping our communities healthy and safe from pollution.  Over the past few months, I have heard from thousands of my constituents who have urged me to oppose Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I would like to read two of the letters I have received. Georgia is a Ph.student at the University of She wrote:       I strongly oppose Scott Pruitt's confirmation as EPA      Mr.Pruitt is a climate change denier who has      actively worked against the mission of the agency.  As a Ph.student in science, I know we need an EPA administrator that respects science and supports clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment. Pruitt is the wrong choice for our nation and must be rejected.  Keiko from Kaneohe also wrote to explain what this fight means to her.       This is not a bipartisan issue, but it is as much an      American issue as it is a Hawaiian issue, a human issue, and      an issue of all inhabitants of Papa, mother earth. I ask that      you continue to be vigilant and `onipa'a in the face of      climate change deniers . . . Mahalo for looking out for      everyone living today and going to be born tomorrow.

1705,topic-id,1260,"Mr.President, last November, I was in Maui celebrating the 100th anniversary of Haleakala National The weather at the summit of the volcano was terrible. It was raining in sheets, with 40-mile-per-hour wind driving the rain sideways, but I was there with over 40 schoolchildren to plant Haleakala silverswords--a special, threatened plant that only grows in the harsh climate at the summit of Haleakala volcano. The silversword can live for almost 100 years before it flowers, spreads its seeds into the wind, and dies.  Silverswords have dotted the landscape of Haleakala's summit for millennia, but invasive species, human activity, and climate change have pushed the plant to near extinction. In the early 1900s, scientists estimated that as few as 50 plants remained on the volcano, but this changed after Haleakala became a national park in 1916. In the 100 years since, park rangers and visitors have made a concerted effort to protect the silverswords from feral goats and sheep and to make sure hikers don't go off the trail and trample their shallow root systems.  After the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the silversword became listed as a threatened species. Through the law, conservationists have provided resources to help restore the silversword population on Haleakala for the hundreds of thousands of people who visit the park every year. Groups of students, including those whom I joined on that cold November day, have planted over 1,000 silverswords to supplement the population of silverswords. They were there to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Haleakala National  I share this story because it demonstrates many of the reasons the Department of Interior is so important in the role it plays in preserving our public lands.  Business is booming at our national parks. In 2015, our national parks hosted 305 million visitors--a new record--and these visitors generated $17 billion in economic activity in nearby communities.  Our national parks are suffering from an overwhelming deferred maintenance backlog of $12 billion. Our national parks are also understaffed. Because of sequestration and a variety of other factors, 10 percent fewer people work in our national parks today than 5 years ago. This is at a time when visitors to our parks are ever growing. This means fewer rangers and support staff dedicated to maintaining parks like Haleakala and protecting species like the silversword. To add to this, the administration has put a 90-day hiring freeze in place that threatens nearly 2,000 permanent vacancies that are critical to helping our national parks function.  We need an Interior Secretary capable of standing up to the President to make preserving our public lands a priority. But during my meeting with Nominee Zinke and his confirmation hearing before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, on which I sit--and his record as a Member of Congress--I did not receive the assurances and commitments I needed to support his confirmation as Interior Although he expressed some support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, or the LWCF--an important program that funds land purchases to add to protective areas like our national parks--he said the program could benefit from some ``changes.'' The only change I wish to see is to permanently reauthorize and fully fund the LWCF, which has suffered from chronic underfunding throughout its history, and I will continue to work with my colleagues, like Senator Maria Cantwell, who is ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in the Senate, to accomplish this goal.  We also need an Interior Secretary committed to preserving our public lands, not exploiting them for fossil fuel production. Congressman Zinke and the Trump administration are too wedded to the fossil fuel industry and fail this test as well.  Supporting alternative and renewable energy development is an issue people in Hawaii and, I would say, a lot of people in the rest of our country care about.  Earlier this year, I received a letter from Michael from Pahoa, who said that Representative Zinke ``has consistently voted for carbon heavy energy sources. His anti-environmental record shows a leaning that could well move exploration and extraction to areas formerly closed to exploitation. With interests in oil pipelines, he has a conflict of interest in moving away from fossil fuels and into alternative and renewable resources. We have destroyed enough of the country for the enrichment of the 1% with little to no benefit to the rest of our citizens. He is a destroyer, not a fixer. Not someone for the environment or the people.''[[Page S1466]]  Congressman Zinke also does not share a commitment to protecting endangered and threatened species like the silversword. While in the House, Congressman Zinke voted to block funding for any listed endangered species on which the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to conduct a 5-year review. It didn't seem to matter to Congressman Zinke that the reason these reviews did not take place was because Republicans in Congress failed to appropriate the necessary funding to conduct these reviews. Cutting funding in this way would devastate conservation and recovery efforts for as many as 850 species across the Nation, 137 of which are in Hawaii and 1 of which is the Haleakala silversword.  During the confirmation process, I asked Congressman Zinke if as Secretary he would work with Congress to ensure that the Fish and Wildlife Service would receive sufficient funding to conduct these reviews and recover our Nation's endangered species. He responded by saying that he would ``work closely with Congress to ensure recovery programs are appropriately funded.'' I don't know what he means by ``appropriate,'' but I do have a feeling that my view of sufficient funding, which is the question I asked him, and his answer that he would support appropriate funding are probably very different. In fact, I wonder if, under Secretary Zinke, there would have been the funding necessary to help Maui students plant their 1,000 silverswords on Haleakala's summit. This is wrong.  Congressman Zinke also does not share a commitment to combating climate change or supporting research that will help in that effort.  Washington, DC--do you notice how warm it is? It is It is 60 degrees. Washington, DC, is on track to have experienced the warmest February on record. We have a new administration stocked full of climate deniers. As Secretary of the Interior, Congressman Zinke will be leading the U.Geological Survey, the USGS, an agency that lists climate change as one of its top mission areas.  During his confirmation process, I asked Congressman Zinke if he would try to limit the USGS's work on climate change in any way. Unfortunately, Congressman Zinke did not provide a definitive answer--only saying that he would need to learn about the USGS's role in climate change research. His answer did not reassure me that he will allow USGS and other agencies in his Department to continue to make climate change research a priority or to protect the right of these scientists to pursue their research without interference. This is particularly concerning in light of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to silence our Federal workers, including those within the National Park Service, who are speaking out about the threat of climate change.  We need a Secretary of the Interior who will protect our public lands, make investments to conserve our endangered and threatened species, and who will continue to confront climate change. His record of past statements demonstrates that Congressman Zinke is not the right person to lead the Department of Interior at this juncture, at this critical stage. I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgS1463-2.txt,1844,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,28.0,February

1407,topic-id,1135,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Well, maybe not exactly Peoria, but Bradley  Mr.Speaker, I rise to honor one of the most decent, patriotic Americans with whom I have ever served in any legislative body. I had the great honor of being Bob Michel's friend, the great honor of being his colleague, and the great honor of believing that what Bob Michel represented in this Congress was the best of us, the most decent of us, the most considerate of us, and deeply committed to his country and[[Page H1344]]respectful of those with whom he served, perhaps differing with them, but, nevertheless, deeply respectful of his colleagues. He and Tip O'Neill were good friends. They could argue their side and their policies vigorously but be the best of friends after we adjourned that day.  I thank my colleague from Illinois for leading this tribute, and I rise to join in remembering this great man, a great American leader, Bob  Mr.Speaker, Bob's entire life was given to service to his country. From his time in the Army as an infantryman on the front lines of the fight for democracy in the Second World War to his long career in government, Leader Michel sought to make America and the world safer and to protect the American Dream for all of our people.  Mr.Speaker, I did not want to lose the majority in 1994, but when we lost, I lamented the fact that Bob Michel did not become the Speaker of the House of In my opinion, if he had, America would be a more civil place today and this body would be a more collegial body than it is.  I want to congratulate the gentleman who represents Bob Michel's district now, succeeding in that office, his father, who is a very dear and close friend of mine. All three of them represented the best of that which America hopes would serve it well.  Bob Michel and I didn't always agree on policy, Mr.Speaker, but as colleagues, we worked together to reach consensus and achieve results. I remember in 1989 when Tony Coelho and I were working to pass the House's version of what would become the landmark Americans with Disabilities It was Bob Michel who saw how important this legislation would be and asked my friend, Steve Bartlett from Texas to work with me, from the Republican side of the aisle, to achieve a bipartisan version that could become law. That is how Bob Michel operated.  This House would be a better House if we followed the example of Bob He saw a problem and looked for a way we could come together around a compromised solution, not focused first on confrontation. His decency and friendliness were as evident as his seriousness as a legislator.  As Republican whip and leader, he set an example of how to lead an effective opposition based not on obstruction, but on identifying ways to work together to achieve common goals. To that extent, and in so many other ways, as I have said, Bob Michel represented the best of us.  Now, Bob, Mr.Speaker, could be tough. He could be really tough. He knew how to defend his party's interests and advance its goals in the minority. But Bob believed strongly that we who are sent here by our constituents have, first and foremost, a responsibility to make policy, not to play politics. And that is how Bob Michel served--by always, always, always putting country first. Mr.Speaker, I hope his example will be an inspiration to all who serve today.  I join in extending my condolences to Bob's children--Scott, Bruce, Robin, and Laurie--and the entire Michel family. I join the people of Illinois' 18th District in mourning the man who was their champion for so many years. Illinois, this House, and our country lost a great light, but one, I hope, that will continue to shine through its reflection in those whom Bob Michel inspired. I was one of those. We will miss him. There aren't enough Bob  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Leader Hoyer for those warm words and inspiring words and heartfelt words for Leader It means so much for his family, for all of us in Peoria, and for all of his colleagues.  I want to thank everybody here tonight from the Illinois delegation that spoke so fondly about Mr.When we think about the traits that he exemplified--integrity, sincerity, humility, genuineness, and civility--that everybody talked about here tonight, I think it is also important to remember where he came from in  The congressional district that he represented, the 18th Congressional District, was the same district that Congressman Abraham Lincoln represented from 1847 to 1849. It is also the same congressional district that Everett Dirksen represented and that Bob Michel represented for 38 years, and you think about the values that they all exemplified, those strong midwestern values they never forgot.  The other thing that is unique about all three is they were all buried within 1 hour of each other. Oak Ridge Cemetery, President Lincoln; Pekin Cemetery, Everett Dirksen; and this last weekend, Leader Michel in Peoria, Bob Michel could have been buried in Arlington Cemetery in a beautiful grave, but he chose to be buried next to the love of his life in Peoria, That says a lot about the person that he was. I think it is unique that, within an hour's drive, you can go see all three of their graves, but I think it reflects the midwestern values that he had and those traits.                              {time}  2015  The other thing that I just want to mention here in closing is that he served his 14 years as the Republican leader, the longest of anyone in this institution as a leader of the minority party. But he also had a number of people that he mentored and tutored: from Jack Kemp, to Trent Lott, to Dick Cheney, to Newt Gingrich; people that served under him, and he mentored in their positions, and that should not be lost.  Bob Michel was a conservative Republican, but the way that he went about the work that he did, his style of civility and treating friend and foe alike, and being able to work across party lines when he needed to made this institution a better place. We need more people like Bob Michel in public service. He is a shining example of what public service should be. I couldn't be prouder to serve in the same congressional district that he represented for 38 years.  Lastly, Mr.Speaker, he made us proud to be from Peoria, He made this institution a better place. He made this country a better place by his service of over 50 years.  Tonight we say: Mr.Leader, rest in peace.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Bob absolutely embodied a uniquely American combination of decency, civility, a commitment to public service, and a deep patriotism throughout his long life. Observers across the spectrum agree Bob Michel defined public service and bipartisanship during his long tenure in Congress as minority whip and as minority leader.  Bob seemed to be uniquely called to the legislature and the legislative process. A workhorse instead of a show horse, Leader Michel steadily pushed forward conservative priorities in the House under both Democratic and Republican  Building relationships across the aisle and promoting civility and debate helped move legislation through the House To him, treating others with respect and care was essential to making deals and moving forward solutions to American problems.  And he cared little if he obtained credit for his efforts. As commented in the National Review, Bob ``made little noise, but made things work.''  Bob was also a patriot. This son of Illinois was a war hero who landed at Utah Beach at During the war, he was wounded and awarded two Bronze Stars and the Purple Heart, among other recognitions.

984,topic-id,1586,"Mr.President, let me say that that was an excellent presentation by Senator I can recall when she first came here, and I sat down with her and we talked about her predecessor and about how people with diverse philosophies can get along and actually love each other.  I would expect the same thing to happen in this case--because it does. I listened to some of the things that were said by the new Senator from California, talking about the rule of law, about freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and the First I agree. I am hoping that we end up with more things in common than things that would keep us apart because we have a lot to do. We need to get busy doing it. I appreciate very much hearing the opening speech by Senator  Mr.President, I wanted to get to the floor because it won't be long until we will be voting on my Oklahoma attorney general, Scott I am looking forward to it. He and I go back a long way. I know that he has been through the ringer, as a lot of them have. I look[[Page S1259]]at Jeff Sessions and some of the abusive things that were said about him during the time that he was going through this process. Of course, the same thing has been true with Scott  Scott Pruitt just happens to be not only a candidate who is going to make an excellent Administrator of the EPA, but he is also one who knows the job. He has been there. He has been attorney general for Oklahoma, my He lives in my home town of Tulsa, So I know him quite well. In fact, I am in aviation, and I remember flying him around the State in some areas, introducing him when he was just starting out in the statewide race.  I think he is going to do a really good job. It is my understanding that my colleagues on the other side are determined to run the clock before we vote on Attorney General Pruitt, and they are using the opportunity to make the case that he will destroy the environment and return pollution to the air and water.  Yet they know that he will do nothing of the sort. Attorney General Pruitt is highly qualified. Yes, it is true that he has had the occasion to file lawsuits on behalf of the State of Oklahoma against the Environmental Protection I can assure you that he knows that he has represented the State of There are many other States that were doing the same thing.  He is a believer in the rule of law and will uphold the laws as passed by Congress within constitutional bounds. He has built a career defending the law, and I see no cause for concern that he will ever stop. He has been practicing law in Oklahoma since 1993, when he graduated from law school at the University of In 1998, he ran and was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate, where he served for 6 years. During that time in the Oklahoma State Senate, he was seen as a leader, someone who could be counted upon, and someone who should be in higher office in the  Of course, that is what happened. Since 2010, he has been the Attorney General for He became a respected defender of the State's role in our Federal system of government. As EPA Administrator, Pruitt will continue to uphold core constitutional principles and won't be engaged in the same Federal overreach that we have seen over the last 8 years.  I know there are varying philosophies in this body. I know there are people who want to concentrate the power in They see nothing wrong with what we refer to as governmental overreach. I have experienced this because it happens that I was the chairman, as well as the ranking member, of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has the jurisdiction over the Environmental Protection So I have watched this take place.  I know that there are members of the Environment and Public Works Committee who have differing philosophies as to what the EPA should be doing. They see outsiders. They see the State, sometimes, as someone who is opposed to the things they are trying to do. But we have watched this happen over the last 8 years.  Attorney General Pruitt has said again and again that he will uphold the laws that we pass right here in Congress--no more and no less. So it is up to us as lawmakers to provide him with effective bipartisan legislation that will make a positive difference for the environment and for our future, while balancing State and private interests. This balance is possible and Scott Pruitt is a testament to this balance.  Oklahoma is an energy Oklahoma is an agricultural We care a great deal about the land we live on and the air we breathe, and we want to be sure it is safe for our families and for generations to come. I think about the Administrator that was there during the years of the Obama administration, and he was actually in a hearing just a few hours ago. He talked about how comforting it was to come to our State of Oklahoma--which he did twice. He learned that landowners are on the side of the environment. They are the ones who want to care for the land. They are the ones who want to exert whatever energies are necessary to take care of the problems with pollution that are present in this world.  As attorney general, Mr.Pruitt has worked closely with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality and the Oklahoma Water Resources Board to protect Oklahoma's scenic rivers from upstream pollution. As a matter of fact, as to his reputation, he is ``Mr.Scenic Rivers'' back in I don't understand how people concerned with the environment are opposing him and saying things about him that are detrimental.  He was able to use unbiased logic and science to reach an agreement with the State of Arkansas to protect our water in He has also been instrumental in negotiating a historic water settlement agreement. This agreement was between the State of Oklahoma, the Choctaw Nation, and the Chickasaw  This thing, I say to the Presiding Officer, has been in litigation for 100 years. He walked in, and he resolved the problem. It was a battle that had gone on for 100 years. One of the chief concerns of the Chickasaw and the Choctaw Nations was to ensure that conservation guidelines were preserved. The agreement not only provides Oklahoma City with its long-term water needs but also protects our two Indian nations with their conservation goals. Again, this was tried by a lot of people over a period of 100 years until Scott Pruitt came along. He is the one who did it.  He has sued the EPA and fought against the Fish and Wildlife Service at times. It has all been in Oklahoma's best interest. Now he will have the entire Nation's best interest in mind when making decisions as the EPA I have no doubt that he will continue to protect our State's interests from overreach and unnecessary harmful regulations.  It is no secret that Attorney General Pruitt's confirmation process has been unusually lengthy. It is time we vote to confirm him in this position. We had his nomination hearing in the Environment and Public Works That was back on January 18, almost a month ago. That hearing was one to be remembered because we broke a record by asking 4 rounds of questions. I suggest that no one in this confirmation process this year or in the last three generations has had to undergo four rounds of questions.  During the course of this day-long, 8-hour hearing, he answered more than 200 questions. Now, after this, he responded to more than 1,000 questions for the record, including the extra questions Senator Carper asked him in a December 28 letter, as Attorney General Pruitt promised he would.  Now, this means that he answered--these are questions for the record--1,600 questions. The average director, during confirmation over the last 3 Presidential years, had 200. So it is 200 questions, as opposed to 1,600 questions that he was subjected to. He never complained about it and actually did a great job.  Now, despite the Democrats' efforts to delay his confirmation vote, we need to be responsible and move forward to confirm Attorney General The longer we postpone this vote, the longer it is going to take for things to get done at the Right now nothing can get done. Everyone knows that. That is wrong. I know that Attorney General Pruitt will continue to be a champion for economic development and environmental responsibility by upholding the law and restoring the Environmental Protection Agency to its role as a regulatory agency, not an activist organization.  You know, this is all for show because everybody knows the votes are there. He is going to be approved. I look forward to working with him. I think he is ready now to move in and do the job. It is going to be a while before he is able to get the other positions confirmed. That is why it is important to go ahead and do it, and I understand we are going to be doing it when this time runs out.  I yield the floor.

We believe that      no one exemplifies these qualities more than Scott       As the Attorney General of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt developed      expertise in environmental law and policy. He negotiated a      historic water rights settlement with Indian tribes that      preserved the ecosystems of scenic lakes and rivers; he      worked with his Democrat counterpart in Arkansas to reduce      pollution in the Illinois River; and he represented the      interests of Oklahomans in rate cases against utility      companies and in numerous actions against those who      contaminated his state's air and water.

117,topic-id,229,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday I introduced my first bill, H.1006, the Access to Counsel Act; and it was a great pleasure to work with my colleague in the Senate, Senator Kamala Harris, who introduced that companion version. The legislation is a direct response to the President's misguided Muslim ban.  In the chaos following the release of the executive order, people across the country were detained at airports and denied opportunities to consult with hundreds of attorneys who were there ready to provide legal support. Some of these people were deported without any access to due process. Even now, we are getting reports of people who are literally relinquishing their legal permanent resident status without consulting with anybody because they don't understand what they are signing.  Detention and deportation without due process happens far too often, even though due process is a right that we hold so dear as For years, we have heard these cases of people being denied the right to counsel, and my bill, the Access to Counsel Act, ensures that anyone who is detained by CBP or held in ICE custody will get access to counsel.  This is a commonsense measure, and I know that there are many who are fearful of what will come next. I want them to know that we will continue to fight for their rights and for their access to due process.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1161-3.txt,2063,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,14.0,February

Last week, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to divest from Wells Fargo, making it the first major city to do so.  Led by Native American and environmental activists, our city made an important statement about the vision that we have for our community and for our world. That vision centralizes both the rights of our native brothers and sisters, and our environment.  Just like it did with the $15 minimum wage, Seattle continues to be a leader and a model for the rest of the country, and activists and cities around the United States have picked up the torch.  We stand united in prioritizing our environment, as it is deeply connected to the health of our communities. Rather than allowing dangerous pipeline projects to continue, putting millions of people at risk, we should be focused on being leaders in the international fight against climate change.  I am committed, Mr.Speaker, to taking every opportunity to protect our resources and fight for a bold alternative energy plan that includes a just transition that creates great union jobs and puts us on a sustainable path forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1224-2.txt,2063,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February

For many people, particularly women, title X funding literally means the difference between receiving reproductive health care or being forced to go without birth control, critical cancer screenings, and other preventive care.  For the 4 in 10 women who access health care at title X-funded providers, cutting this funding would mean cutting their access to health care altogether. For people of color, rural communities, and those who struggle to make ends meet, cutting title X funds will certainly have a disproportionate impact.  Let's be very clear that these funds are not controversial, but the Republican majority in Congress and anti-choice groups are doing their best to create a false narrative in order to demonize this funding, which has done nothing but improve the lives of millions of people. Cutting this funding would actually increase the number of unwanted pregnancies by nearly 1 million in just a year alone and would increase abortions by 33 percent.  Women need title X so they can continue to make decisions with their doctors. It is 2017, and a woman's uterus is not a political football.

573,topic-id,1931,"Mr.President, I rise today to support the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney and ask my colleagues to vote to confirm him as the next Director of the Office of Management and  It may not surprise folks that I have a markedly different viewpoint than the Senator from New Congressman Mulvaney wants to save Social Security and Congressman Mulvaney wants to prevent, stop the mortgaging of our children's future, the bankrupting of  One thing on which I do agree with the good Senator from New Hampshire is that we need to concentrate on economic growth. It is the primary component of the solution. But this Nation faces many, many challenges. From the standpoint of foreign policy, take a look at what is happening around the world, the turmoil in so much of the world. We are in a generational struggle against Islamic terror, against ISIS, al-Iran--that nuclear agreement was horrible. It modified the behavior for the worse. We have just witnessed North Korea test-fire another missile. Combined with their nuclear capability at some point in time--probably not in the too distant future--they will threaten China has been emboldened. Russia has become more aggressive. Why? Because in so many instances, these nations perceive America as weaker than we once were, lacking the strength and resolve to provide the leadership, project our values around the world.  With all these threats that America faces, at the same time our military is being hollowed out. We won't have the resources militarily to fight back if they strike first.  Domestically, we also face many perils, many challenges. ObamaCare didn't work. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act did not protect the patients. It is not affordable. In my State, Wisconsin, premiums on the individual market have doubled and tripled. A young mother working a part-time job so she could stay home with her children had to quit that job to take full-time work to pay her $8,000 per year increase in premiums. Wages have stagnated for years. Our infrastructure is old and in many cases, crumbling. Our borders are porous. We are not winning the War on Drugs because of porous borders in many respects. Unfortunately, the War on Poverty has also not been won. In many cases, it has created perverse incentives that have trapped generations in a cycle of poverty and dependency and despair. It has resulted in the national debt rapidly approaching $20 trillion. Again, that is that mortgaging our children's future that Congressman Mulvaney wants to prevent.  As the chart nearby shows, we are on a completely unsustainable path that Congressman Mulvaney also understands must be stopped. If you take a look at this chart, according to the Congressional Budget Office, over the next 30 years, our projected deficit will total $103 trillion. That would be put on top of that $20 trillion in debt. It will be $10 trillion over the next 10 years, $28 trillion in the second decade, $66 trillion in the third decade. That is completely unsustainable.  By the way, the components of that $103 trillion deficit--$14 trillion in Social In other words, Social Security will pay out $14 trillion more in benefits than it takes in from the payroll tax over the next 30 years; Medicare, $34 trillion. The remainder of that $103 trillion is interest on the debt. If we want to avoid paying creditors more than $50 trillion in interest on our debt over the next 30 years, we need to address Social Security and Congressman Mulvaney wants to do that. He wants to save Social Security and Medicare--not demagogue it; save it.  As the Senator from New Hampshire was pointing out, we need economic growth. That is the 1 component of the solution. I don't care what problem I just mentioned above, economic growth is the primary component of the solution.  What is hampering our economy from growing? The fact is, since the Great Depression, our economy has averaged 3.2 percent annual real growth. Since the great recession, we have only been growing about 2 percent. I would argue that there are a number factors causing that tepid growth: overregulation, an uncompetitive tax system. We are not fully utilizing our energy resources. The Presiding Officer certainly understands that from his We are not utilizing our abundant energy resources. And of course there is this: our unsustained fiscal path, our $20 trillion in debt.  I oftentimes make the analogy between our national debt and a family in debt over their head. It is just a nation-state; it is just many, many, many[[Page S1200]]orders of magnitude larger. But the fact is, if you are a family in debt over your head, how can you grow your personal economy? All your disposable income is spent on the basics and servicing the debt. The same thing is true of a nation-state. Again, our enemies perceive that weakness caused by our indebtedness.  So when you take a look at the role of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, what we need to do to grow our economy comes under his jurisdiction basically. He has to address this deficit. He has to put forward a budget that is sustainable. Mick Mulvaney is dedicated to doing that.  Then, of course, the other thing the Office of Management and Budget is really designed to combat is overregulation. They are all about taking a look at cost-benefit and making sure the regulations that are implemented by this Federal Government are reasonable from a cost-benefit relationship. That has not been the case recently.  Just a couple of examples of how economic growth really is going to help solve this problem. If you go from 2 to 3 percent annual growth, that is $14 trillion in added economic benefit in just over a decade. If you go from 2 to 4 percent, that is $29 trillion. And even with the meager economic growth we have had since 2009, revenue to the Federal Government has increased by more than $1.1 trillion per year with meager economic growth. Just think of what would happen if we could reduce the regulatory burden, have a competitive tax system, and put our Federal Government on a sustainable fiscal path. Revenue would be flowing to the Federal Government, we could stop hollowing out our military, and we could start addressing these threats.  As to the regulatory burden, when we held hearings on this in my committee, the numbers showed that regulatory burden at $2 trillion per year. Just put that into perspective because I know we are getting immune to these massive numbers: $2 trillion is larger than all but 10 economies in the entire world. That is a self-imposed, self-inflicted wound on our economy. If you take that $2 trillion and divide it by the number of households in America, it is $14,800 per household. No American writes a check to the Federal Government to pay their share of the regulatory burden; instead, they realize that burden in reduced opportunities.  Why are wages stagnated? That is a good part of it--increased prices, and of course, again, those lower wages. It is a massive problem. One Wisconsin paper manufacturer I was talking to--and by the way, I can't tell you who because he fears retaliation by the government, which is a different subject--did a cost calculation of just four recently issued regulations and came up with a total cost of $12,000 per year per employee. There you go. That is money that could have been available for increasing wages or for investing in business to create better opportunities and better paying jobs. The regulatory burden is massive.  I had the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison come into my office during the last 2 years with the primary complaint--the primary ask--being to reduce that regulatory burden. Last year, she came in armed with a study commissioned by research universities that said that 42 percent of researcher time on Federal grants was spent complying with Federal regulations. Think of the opportunity cost of that overregulation. Those Federal grants are meant to pay for studies and doing research on curing diseases, not filling out Federal paperwork. So again, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget will take a look at those regulations, particularly now under this President, who has issued an Executive order to make sure that for every one regulation issued by a new agency, they have to remove two. That is a very good start. I would have gone with one-in, ten-out, but I will settle for one-in, two-out. I will certainly be supportive of an Office of Management and Budget that understands the incredible burden of overregulation on our economy.  During our committee markup--I heard earlier the Senator from Arkansas, who knows Congressman Mulvaney, served with him in the House, and understands how dedicated and serious Congressman Mulvaney is to stopping this mortgage of our children's future. Senator Lankford also had the opportunity to serve 4 years in the House with Representative This is what Senator Lankford had to say about his friend and colleague at the nomination hearing:       You were a serious student. You looked hard at difficult      issues. You understood that there were difficult decisions      that needed to be made and made proposals to do that.  In testimony before our committee, Congressman Mulvaney told my committee:       When President-elect Trump announced my nomination, he      noted that our nation was nearly $20 trillion in debt and      stated that I have the skills and convictions to responsibly      manage our nation's finances. I believe that is why he      nominated me for this position.  He went on to state:       For the first time in America's history, the next      generation could be less prosperous than the generation that      preceded it.  That is a very sad possibility. We need to prevent that.  He went on to say:       To me and to the people in this room, that is simply      unacceptable. We CAN turn this economy, and this country      around . . . but it will take tough decisions today in order      to avoid impossible ones tomorrow.  Congressman Mulvaney went on:       I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a      problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later. I      also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way      Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy      economy.  Again, he fully understands the connection between our unsustainable fiscal path, our deficit, our debt, and economic growth. He said we ``must include changing our government's long-term fiscal path--which is unsustainable.''  Finally, he said:       I recognize that good public service--whether in a state      legislature, Congress, or OMB--takes both courage and wisdom.      The courage to lead, and the wisdom to listen. I have learned      that I do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Facts--and the      cogent arguments of others--matter. I will be loyal to the      facts and to the American people whom I serve.       My commitment to you today is to take a fact-based approach      to get our financial house in order.  This is exactly the type of person--Congressman Mick Mulvaney--somebody who is dedicated to solving these problems, who has the courage and the wisdom to stop mortgaging our children's future, to put America's budget on a sustainable fiscal path, to grow our economy, to make sure that future generations inherit a stronger, more prosperous  I am proud to support and I urge all my colleagues to support and vote for the confirmation of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next Director of the Office of Management and  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

544,topic-id,1381,"Thank you, Mr. I rise to speak on the nomination of Representative Mulvaney to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the matter currently pending before us.  I will vote against the nomination because of Representative Mulvaney's opposition to bipartisan budget accords, targeting of Federal employees, and his willingness to use the full faith and credit of the United States as negotiating leverage.  This is a really important position and I am on the Budget Committee that oversees OMB and its opportunities. The OMB Director is a primary adviser to the President on budgetary matters. The OMB Director is in charge of preparing the annual budget submission to Congress, and the management function of the OMB is a very important one in terms of management of the Federal workforce and the work of the executives.  We have seen OMB Directors in the past deeply involved in fiscal negotiations of national importance, most notably in the time I have been here on deals to address the across-the-board sequester cuts and even the shutdown of government in October of 2013. So it is very important that in this position the Director have a proven record of public service. One side or the other is fine, but there has to be a recognition of the value of bipartisan compromise, putting the country first, putting pragmatism ahead of ideology, and a commitment that is rock solid to maintaining the fiscal credibility and integrity of the country. I worry about Representative Mulvaney in each of these areas.  With respect to bipartisan compromise on budget matters, I was a budget conferee in 2013 after the government shutdown. The Senate and House each had a budget. There was a refusal to sit down to do a budget conference. That led to the absence of a budget and the shutdown of the government for 16 days--the greatest government on  As we came out of that, there was a recognition and an agreement that we would sit down and try to hammer out a budget compromise. People didn't give us a lot of odds that we would do it, but because of the leadership of then-Budget chairs, now the current Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, and Patty Murray, the Budget chairs enabled us to reach a compromise that was for the good of the country by the end of calendar year 2013.  At that point, the nominee was a Member of Congress and played a very active role in opposing the budget compromise. He voted against the deal we needed to get following the shutdown of the government, and his quote was:       It seems, yet again, that Washington cannot wean itself      from its spending addiction. Indeed, what we saw today is      another example of how we got $17 trillion in debt: we can      have lots of bipartisanship, as long as we spend more money.  The unwillingness to embrace a bipartisan compromise, even after the Government of the United States shut down, troubles me significantly.  I worry about his pragmatism on these matters. He has supported using government shutdown and the threat of government shutdown as a lever--as a lever to defund Planned Parenthood, as a lever on other matters that he thinks are important, and that is fine, but to use those as a lever--to use the shutdown of the Federal Government--that government that Abraham Lincoln said was a government by, of, and for the people and it should not perish from the face of the Earth--I view that as we shouldn't shut the Federal Government of the United States down--but he has used debt ceiling and shutdown as a leverage to gain his way on points of lesser importance than whether the government stays open.  He has continued to support the sequester, which I believe is bad policy for the United States: ``We want to keep the sequester in place and then take the cuts we can get.''  There is also a significant issue that matters to me in my I asked him about it during the hearing that demonstrates an ideology over pragmatism, which is, Does he accept the science behind climate change? Why does that matter for an OMB Director?  Well, we are investing money in storm relief. We are investing money in[[Page S1173]]emergency relief. We are investing money when we rewrite the flood insurance program.  In Hampton Roads, Virginia, in the State where I live, 1.6 million people--the biggest center of naval power in the country--deeply affected by sea level rise. If you are a Budget Director, some of what you do is make recommendations for how to spend money on things like resilience to sea level rise, but if you do not believe that humans are affecting climate change, then your budgets are not going to show that you think that is a priority. In questions before the committee, Representative Mulvaney challenged the notion that humans are affecting climate change.  Finally, I worry about his effect on the Federal workforce. There are more than 170,000 Federal employees in Virginia, a large part of my constituency. They do a great job. There is going to be some challenging employees in any entity, whether it is in the Senate or whether it is in a private entity. On balance, our Federal employees are people who deserve our thanks for the job they do.  The House took an action at the beginning of January--the Senate did not take this action, but the House took an action that reinstated something called the Holman rule. The Holman rule is a longstanding, but for a long while unused, doctrine that allows the House, in an appropriations bill, to target an individual employee and reduce their salary to as low as $1 a year. They couldn't fire someone without violating civil service rules, but the House voted to be able to target individual employees and reduce their salaries to $1 a year. This, together with a Federal hiring freeze and other actions, is causing a great deal of angst among the Federal workforce. Congressman Mulvaney supported the notion of bringing back the Holman rule so individual employees could be targeted. I asked him about that when we visited in the office, and he did not have an answer that I found convincing or credible.  Finally, the debt ceiling. We are going to confront within a few months the debt ceiling of the United States--our willingness to honor the obligations of the debt that has previously been incurred. The full faith and credit of the United States shall not be questioned is something that is very important. I think it is in the 14th amendment to the Certainly, that has been our example that we have set around the world; that we have strong credit and no one can ever question whether the United States will stand behind its debts.  Congressman Mulvaney has often taken the position that the United States could default on debt and then prioritize which debts it would pay. That happens in the commercial space sometimes. Sometimes it is an intentional tool and sometimes it is an accidental tool and we have bankruptcy laws to allow the prioritization of debt. The United States does not repudiate its debts, and we should not flirt with something like a debt ceiling and suggest that we are going to repudiate our debts.  In closing, I am troubled by the nominee's opposition of bipartisan budget efforts. I am troubled by an ideological position that says we could potentially default on our debts or flirt with shutting down the government to achieve my way on this or that issue. For those reasons, I would oppose him.  His public service in Congress is something I respect, and I respect the fact that he has been returned to the body multiple times by his voters. That should be worthy of respect as well, but in terms of being the chief budget official for the United States, I do not think he has demonstrated the ability to do that and to keep America's fiscal policy and reputation sound.  For those reasons, I will oppose him.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1170.txt,2176,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE OF DEPARTMENT OF,2017.0,15.0,February
608,topic-id,458,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing the 400 Years of African American History Commission  We are 2 years away from a key anniversary in American history. August 2019 will mark 400 years since the first documented arrival of Africans who came to English America by way of Point Comfort, This historic and tragic moment, when ``20 and odd'' Africans, as it was recorded were the first recorded group of Africans to arrive involuntarily and were sold as involuntary laborers or indentured servants in the colonies. This indelible mark in American history should not pass without recognition.  During my tenure as Governor of Virginia, I presided over the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, VA, by the English colonists in 1604. Two years ago I attended the 450th anniversary of the founding of Augustine, FL, which celebrated Hispanic heritage. Both commemorations included activities sponsored by Federal commissions, which were voted on and passed by  Having commemorated the English and Spanish heritage of our founding, there is no reason it should be any different for the arrival and continuous presence of Africans and African Americans in the English settlements in 1619. There is no dispute that the beginning of African and African-American presence in what is now the United States was both heartbreaking and regrettable. Although in 1619 slavery was not yet an institution, the involuntary status of those first Africans was the impetus to slavery. Slavery as an institution broke up families, resulted in the deaths of thousands, and caused irreparable damage to our American psyche. And though we should never forget that period of stain on our history, slavery is not the only part of African-American history. I have had an opportunity to visit the National Museum of African American History and The museum makes a tremendous effort to tell the complete story of African Americans and it is important that we remember the whole story. African Americans have contributed to the economic, academic, social, cultural and moral well-being of this Their impact and influence has shaped this nation to what it is today.  So today, with my cosponsor Senator Mark Warner, I reintroduce the 400 Years of African American History Commission Act, which would establish a commission that would plan programs and activities across the country to recognize the arrival and influence of African Americans since 1619. It is my hope the establishment of a ``400th'' commission would create an opportunity to bring continued national education about the significance the arrival of African Americans has made to the United States and the contributions that have been made since 1619. Additionally, the commission would create space to discuss race relations in America and focus on dismantling the institutional systems that have adversely hindered African American progress.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1219.txt,2176,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE OF DEPARTMENT OF,2017.0,15.0,February

947,topic-id,2102,"Mr.President, I also rise to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA  To summarize--and then I will go into some detail--Virginians are pro-science people. The political figure we most venerate is still Thomas Jefferson, who was the preeminent scientist of his day. We are pro-science people. Second, the evidence from Mr.Pruitt's career demonstrates he is anti-science in the climate area and possibly others. Third, there is no position in the Federal Government that more relies upon accurate science and scientistic judgement than EPA  I think the President is afforded significant discretion in appointing members of the Cabinet, and I have voted to confirm a number of President Trump's nominees even if I wouldn't have nominated them myself because I think they meet the basic test of competence and integrity. But I have voted against individuals if they can't satisfy me that they meet our ethical standards or that they are qualified for the position or that they are able to do the job fairly and objectively.  The ability of the EPA Administrator to do this job fairly and objectively requires an acknowledgement of the scientific reality of climate change and other science. This isn't an abstract matter for Virginia, and it is not an abstract matter for the EPA  Next only to coastal Louisiana, Virginia is the most susceptible State to sea level rise. Hampton Roads, VA, with 1.6 million people--our second largest metropolitan area--not only is it a busy and thriving metropolitan area, but it is the center of American naval power and the largest base of naval operations in the world. It is the homeport for the U.Atlantic fleet. What we are seeing throughout Hampton Roads, VA, is that neighborhoods where you could sell and buy a house 15 years ago, you now can't because normal tidal action renders the homes impossible to sell. It affects businesses.  By 2040, the main road into the largest naval base in the world, Norfolk, will be covered 2 to 3 hours a day just by normal tidal action, not by storm surges, which make it more significant. So now the cities of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Chesapeake, Newport News, and Hampton are all trying to figure out ways to make resiliency investments to protect against sea level rise, and the Department of Defense is having to contemplate the same kinds of investments to protect our naval operations in Hampton  The EPA's mission and its entire existence revolve around science. To enforce the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, to set limits on pollutants that are stringent enough to have measurable benefits but reasonable enough to avoid negative economic impacts to the degree we can, and to pore over reams and reams of data and analysis and figure out whether a chemical in a consumer product is harmful takes science. To analyze whether fracking or some other method of extracting energy is dangerous to drinking water or not dangerous or somewhere in the middle or what the right limits should be takes science.  In an earlier iteration, I was the mayor of My city has a river in the middle of it that was so polluted--the James River--you couldn't swim in it and you couldn't fish in it. There was no bird life in it because it had been polluted over such a long time. Today, go to Richmond, VA, and you will see people canoeing[[Page S1237]]and kayaking. You will see people fishing and taking the fish home to eat. You will see people swimming. It has gone from the sewer of our city to the front yard of our city, to the thing that has helped bring population back into downtown Richmond and grow our population, and it happened because of the Clean Water  There is always a question in regulation--too hot, too cold, or just right. But my city would not be what it is today had there not been a Clean Water Act that required us--in some ways that were painful at times--to save the river, and now it has herons, bald eagles, fish, kayakers, and canoeists, and everybody's quality of life and the economy are better too.  Mr.Pruitt has been asked repeatedly about his views on climate science. Just 4 months ago, he stated:       We've done a lot [in reducing carbon emissions], and that's      not even addressing, guys, the fact that there's a tremendous      dispute, as you know, that's going on in the marketplace      about how much this global warming trend that the [Obama]      administration talks about, if it's true or not.       Is it truly man-made and is this simply just another period      of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? I      mean is it just typical natural type of occurrences as      opposed to what the Administration says?  That was just 4 months ago. This kind of skepticism--we don't know whether humans cause it; we don't know whether it is natural--is exactly the kind of thing we have seen in Congress before. There was a famous hearing in Congress that was sort of emblazoned on people's memories of a whole bunch of witnesses standing up and swearing to tell the truth and saying: We don't know that there is a connection between cigarette smoking and cancer. This kind of denial of the scientific consensus from an Administrator of the chief agency that needs science in this country is deeply troubling.  I don't think it should be going out on a limb to declare that climate change is happening, driven largely by the burning of fossil fuels, and is a problem we have to deal with in some way. How to deal with it, how quickly to deal with it--those are tough questions, but acknowledging the science should not be tough.  That acknowledgement of the science was the policy of a predecessor of mine, Virginia Senator John Warner, a Republican, who introduced one of the first climate bills in Congress with Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman in 2006. This policy that we recognize science was the policy of the George H.Bush administration, which negotiated the U.Framework Convention on Climate Change more than 25 years ago. It was the policy that underlay the Presidential campaign of one of our colleagues, Senator John McCain, in 2008.  Acknowledging the science of climate change isn't a matter of political views; it is a matter of science and reality. We can discuss and debate what to do about it, and I think those are challenging discussions to have. That is fair game. Differences of opinion about what to do about--that is fair game. But denying an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change exists and that it is driven by human activity in the burning of fossil fuels--something ExxonMobil scientists were agreeing to in papers written in the 1980s, not 4 months ago--denying that is a denial of science.  I worry. If Mr.Pruitt denies science on this matter, what other science will he deny? His record as attorney general in Oklahoma bears me out on my worry to some degree. In virtually every decision, the attorney general's office defended the interests of oil and gas, of Big Agribusiness, and basically the interests of polluters against the interests of clean air and water, which are the interests of our families and our kids.  A New York Times article from 2 years ago--before Mr.Pruitt was nominated for this position--identified that when the EPA was looking at the potential impacts--potential, not guaranteed; we are trying to determine if there are impacts--of fracking on water quality and seismic instability, Attorney General Pruitt submitted comments on behalf of the State of Oklahoma that expressed skepticism that fracking was causing any problems. Well, why not do the investigation? Why not get to the bottom of it? Was the opinion that he expressed backed by science? Was it backed by a deep analysis that had been done by scientists or smart attorneys in Mr.Pruitt's office? In this instance, good investigative journalism determined that the comment expressing skepticism about fracking having any effect on water quality was actually written by an energy company, copied, and pasted onto official Oklahoma letterhead and submitted to the EPA as representing the views of Oklahoma public officials.  Would it be appropriate for the attorney general of Oklahoma--a State that has significant oil and gas--to take into account the views of oil and gas producers on something as important as fracking? In fact, you would not be doing your job if you didn't take the views of those companies into account. But considering industry views is very different from taking their views and portraying them as coming from you, a holder of a public trust who is supposed to be working for everybody and not just one company or one industry.  Here is one more example I will give before I conclude, because I take it personally. Virginia is one of the six States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. I worked on this matter as Governor of Virginia, along with colleagues in the other States and the District of Columbia, and we worked together with the EPA on how to clean up the bay. This is a treasured resource for It is about as bipartisan a thing as there is in Probably next to support for veterans, support for the Chesapeake Bay would be a close second in bipartisanship. As public officials, we worked out with the EPA a strategy we thought would be conducive to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay--which is not just about enjoyment, not just about water quality, but also about traditional Virginia industries, like watermen's industry tourism, which is a big industry in our  We worked it out to our satisfaction, but when we did, there was a lawsuit filed against this particular regulation by the Farm The attorney general of Oklahoma--not one of the six States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed--the attorney general of Oklahoma intervened and filed a friend-of-the-court brief to try to strike down the regulation that the EPA and Virginia officials had worked on in tandem for the good of the Chesapeake Bay, for the good of our Commonwealth, for the good of our citizens.  I contend: Why would an attorney general in Oklahoma care so much about a Chesapeake Bay rule that we had worked out together? I contend that he and some other attorneys general who joined in this were worried that if the EPA succeeded, then the EPA might try something in other large watersheds, including those in their  The matter did go to the Federal appellate court. The Federal appellate court upheld the Chesapeake Bay plan. The attorneys general and others tried to take it to the Supreme The Supreme Court wouldn't take the appeal, and so the Chesapeake Bay plan is in operation. We were all struck about why an Oklahoma attorney general would be going after something affecting the Commonwealth of Virginia, and there is a point there.  The point was this. EPA scientists working in tandem with State officials had analyzed the water quality in the bay, and they had followed the State's progress, or lack thereof, over time, and they finally said, again, working in tandem with many of us: The pollution levels are so bad that we are never going to return the bay to what it can be unless we need to take action.  It was that scientific consensus that Mr.Pruitt as attorney general of Oklahoma was challenging. Science is the pursuit of truth. Science is supposed to follow where the facts lead, no matter what the scientist's initial views might be.  Mr.Pruitt's record does not tell me he will follow the data wherever it leads. It tells me that whenever there is a menu of options, he is going to take the option that is most beneficial to polluters rather than beneficial to public health.  I will conclude with the point at which I started. There is no Federal agency that needs to have somebody who accepts science and scientific consensus more than the It matters[[Page S1238]]deeply to Virginia, but I don't think Virginians are unique to this. I think it matters to the citizens of 50  EPA regulations are not all wise, and some need to be dialed back.

Career and technical education, CTE, programs are a critical component to every student's education, creating diverse pathways into further education and developing careers. Today, approximately 11.5 million students are enrolled in CTE, encompassing every State through nearly 1,700 two-year and thousands more secondary CTE centers, comprehensive high schools career academies and CTE high schools.  According to the U.Department of Education's Office for Career, Technical and Adult Education, in 2012, the average high school graduation rate for students concentrating in CTE programs was 93 percent, compared with the national average of 80 percent. These students gain real-world skills through applied learning, and integrate their academic curriculum with technical and employability skills. In addition, our Nation's continued economic competitiveness relies on the skill of the American workforce and its ability to meet and adapt to the 21st-century economy.  CTE prepares students with education and training leading to industry-recognized credentials, including certifications, licenses, certificates and degrees, in a wide variety of fields. According to the U.Department of Labor, of the top three fastest-growing occupations, all will require real-world skills that can be mastered through CTE--none require a bachelor's degree and all have median salaries above $50,000 per year. By increasing opportunities for students to obtain postsecondary skills training and meaningful credentials, CTE can spread economic opportunity to all students who are willing to work for it.  Today with my Senate CTE Caucus cochairs Senator Portman, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Young and other colleagues in the Senate, I am introducing a bipartisan resolution to designate February as Career and Technical Education, CTE, CTE Month provides a chance for students, counselors, educators and administrators to learn more about the educational opportunities available in their communities and recognize the importance of CTE in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce in the United This year's resolution also marks the 100th anniversary of the Smith-Hughes National Vocational Education Act of 1917, the Nation's first major federal investment in secondary  By formally recognizing CTE Month through this resolution, it is our hope that we can build greater awareness for the importance of strengthening access to high-quality CTE for millions of America's students and our nation's continued economic competitiveness.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1398-3.txt,2176,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE BY SECRETARY OF,2017.0,16.0,February

381,topic-id,372,"Mr.Speaker, America should no longer be shocked with the Republican mantra of ``no'' to everything--that is, until Wall Street and the financial services industry calls. Today's action on H.66 and 67 illustrates this unfortunate reality.  Congressional Republicans once again are putting the financial industry ahead of average American workers. Their attempt to roll back President Obama's Department of Labor rules, which expanded working families' abilities to save their own retirement money through State- and large-city-administered retirement savings programs. The Republican proposal restricts saving options for working people.  For years, Republicans have hawked a false crisis about Social Security solvency; meanwhile, now they are proposing a very real retirement security crisis for America's seniors. We are nearing a boiling point. The difference between what average Americans have saved for retirement and where their savings should be is staggering: more than $6 trillion in shortfalls.  Roughly half of all U.families have no money set aside for retirement. Thirty-nine million Americans don't have access to a workplace retirement savings plan. Even Americans who work diligently to save for retirement are falling behind. With 10,000 American seniors reaching retirement age every day, enormous strain on the Federal budget is mounting to make up the difference.  Today most workers don't have a pension. Those that do, can't be so sure it will be there throughout their golden years. There has been a dramatic decline in guaranteed retirement benefits through employer support.  Without access to easy and affordable savings vehicles, far too many American workers will retire into poverty. This leads to overreliance on Social Security and other State and Federal assistance programs. It surely isn't the American  President Obama identified this crisis. He spoke to Congress about trying to work together to address it through bipartisan action, but our Republican colleagues said ``no.'' Their failure to act drove President Obama to coordinate with States, eight of which have already passed laws to create State-administered retirement programs for private sector workers, which H.66 and 67 would roll back.  More than half the States are considering similar action to improve retirement readiness, and these plans help small businesses offer savings plans for their employees without imposing financial burdens.

451,topic-id,1117,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Veasey) for his great leadership in bringing us together in this Blue Collar I feel very comfortable. I actually have blue on today.  I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Brendan Boyle) of the greater Philadelphia area, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Norcross), and myself from the Toledo to Cleveland, Ohio, part of our country to bring to the attention of the American people the fact, for example, that workers in northern Ohio, since the year 2000, earn on average $7,000 less than they did at the beginning of the century. They have taken some great hits. They are hardworking people. They are fighting back, but they need our help.  In the last 3 weeks, if we take a look at President Trump's term thus far, we begin to see the real Donald at work, if I might quote one of the news media. After months of grandiose campaign promises to renegotiate NAFTA, bring back American manufacturing jobs, and make America great, we can begin to assess where he is putting his attention. I think this is really important for us, as we represent blue-collar America, what is he doing for them. I think the proof is in his actions, or lack thereof.  After roughly 20 executive orders and actions, we see President Trump has a penchant for mediagenic events and moments with a hodgepodge of executive orders, but apparently not sending any legislation up here yet. And most striking is his clear motivation to assist his wealthy friends on Wall Street with appointments to the administration, such as Secretary of Treasury, rather than paying attention to average Americans who voted for him. He exhibits a great penchant for public approval rather than a focus on efforts to improve the current economic stagnation of average  We are noting that he is filled his Cabinet with billionaires and multimillionaires who simply can't figure out how to walk in the shoes of blue-collar His actions to help the wealthiest Americans will have significant consequences.  So what happened with his promise to drain the swamp?  I thought in the first month we would have had something that would really resonate out in the heartland.  While all of this happens just miles away at the White House, our Republican congressional colleagues remain either silent or moving the car in reverse.  Why would they criticize activity that helps those who fund their elections?  We need campaign finance reform to dominate their political focus and write their policy objectives, like taking away today here in the House the ability of workers to save money for their own pensions, for heaven's sake.  In Trump's first days, he took action to roll back the financial reform bill called Dodd-Frank and tried to eliminate protections for seniors as they seek retirement investment advice. We know there are a lot of sharks out there in the financial waters.  Why wouldn't you want to help the American people rather than hurt them more?  He did nothing to address the trade issues, which were in his power to do on day one, and propelled his victory through our part of the country. I note my colleagues come from Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and me being from It was actually the Midwestern States that lifted this President to victory. He hasn't declared China as a currency manipulator. He could have done that already.  He had no elimination of the Buy America waiver, which affords access to U.Government contracts for all firms and goods from 45 World Trade Organization nations and 16 additional U.Free Trade Agreements that exist. Not a word about that.  No NAFTA renegotiation. He could have pulled the plug on that on day one.  Where is the negotiating team in place to take care of what NAFTA has done to the people of the heartland and our country in general?  What will President Trump do for ongoing negotiations he inherited on the U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty, the Trade in Services Agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership? Will he put American workers, global workers, and environmental concerns at the forefront of negotiations? Or will he continue to allow corporate and wealthy financial interests to dominate and run roughshod over workers and communities?  Candidate Trump promised the 15,000 steelworkers laid off due to a flood of unfairly traded imports that he would support America's manufacturing and industrial base. He came to Ohio and said that. He promised to protect our industries from the Chinese and to keep jobs at home. But in the pipeline of executive action, he actually enforced the trade agreement Buy America waiver, negating his promises to help America's steelworkers. How about that? That was done in the first month.  Just recently, the U.Department of Commerce released a report that showed the U.trade deficit hit a 4-year high as it rose to over half a billion dollars for 2016. Middle America isn't surprised this trade deficit continues to hollow out U.manufacturing jobs and depress incomes across our great Reducing our trade deficit should be a top priority for the new administration. I hope the President puts a big scoreboard in front of the White House on his progress on this front. It would do wonders to fix the economy for working Americans if we balanced that trade deficit.  As Congressman Veasey has said, the Democratic Party has long championed issues for blue-collar America that create real life success for working class people. Lost in the political dialogue is the reality that Democrats have always stood for individual and economic rights for average Americans of all backgrounds. Each of us in our own lives represents that, and it is a privilege to serve here in this  For blue-collar families, education remains a vital stepping-stone in upward mobility. Democrats continue to prioritize early childhood literacy and STEM education, efforts to make Americans globally competitive in advanced manufacturing, science, medicine, and research and development. Democrats continue to expand apprenticeship options to allow young people to enter the workforce trained and without the enormous burden of student loans.  Meanwhile, Republicans push policies that exacerbate the ever-expanding wealth gap, even allowing it to invade our school systems. Just watch the opposition Mr.Trump and his newly minted Education Secretary Betsy DeVos have towards public schools.

459,topic-id,848,"Mr.Speaker, let me be clear: between 1933 and 1945, 14 million unarmed men, women, and children were murdered in Eastern These bloodlands were where most of Europe's Jews lived and where Hitler's and Stalin's imperial plans overlapped. Of the 14 million human beings who were killed, at least 6 million were Jewish souls. Their carnage was the largest in human history.  Thus, the brevity of the Trump administration's statement was surprisingly and unusually short and general--only about 100 words. When the White House was asked about these glaring omissions, multiple officials in the new administration at the White House merely confirmed ``the statement was no mistake.''  The Trump White House statement chose not to explicitly acknowledge the deaths of 6 million Jews during the This is atypical of any former President of our country. Moreover, the Trump statement implies that the recognition of the death of Jews during the Holocaust would come at the exclusion of other groups. The tone of those remarks takes the reader in the direction of denying the suffering of the Jewish people.  For the President not to mention Jews is a terrible omen.  So let us go through some history. The term ``holocaust,'' arising from World War II, has come to mean annihilation of Jewish persons. From 1933 to 1945, those Jewish souls who perished in Europe totaled at least 6 million human beings. Between 2.7 million and 3 million Jews were murdered in Nazi-run death camps. In the USSR, 1,340,000 Jewish deaths were ordered by Joseph At least 1.5 million of the victims forcibly killed by Hitler and Stalin were children.  Cumulatively, this carnage represented about two-thirds of the 9 million Jews who had resided in Central By way of explanation, for the 8 million Christians and others who were also murdered, the term generally used to describe their carnage is martyrdom. As an example, in Poland, 3 million Catholic Christian Poles were martyred by Nazi and Soviet killing machines.  The Holocaust also included Stalin's mass executions and forced starvation[[Page H1236]]and relocation of Soviet prisoners of war to fight in horrendous places like the Battle of Monte Cassino after being marched through the Middle Many of them were buried in  Stalin also perpetrated a massive post-war ethnic and religious cleansing of Jews and non-As Hitler and Stalin fought for control of the European continent, over 14 million innocent people--these aren't soldiers I am talking about.

Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record excerpts of an article entitled ``This is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World,'' which is also available at www.buzzfeed.com.                     [From BuzzFeed News Reporter]             This Is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World                          (By Lester Feder)       Donald Trump's newly named chief strategist and senior      counselor Steve Bannon laid out his globalist nationalist      vision in unusually in-depth remarks delivered by Skype to a      conference held inside the Vatican in the summer of 2014.       Bannon: I think it's a little bit more complicated. When      Vladimir Putin, when you really look at some of the      underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those      come from what I call Eurasianism; he's got an advisor who      harkens back to Julius Evola and different writers of the      early 20th century who are really the supporters of what's      called the traditionalist movement, which really eventually      metastazied into Italian fascism. A lot of people that are      traditionalists are attracted to that.       One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin      is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying      to do it in a form of nationalism--and I think that people,      particularly in certain countries, want to see the      sovereignty for their country, they want to see nationalism      for their country. They don't believe in this kind of pan-     European Union or they don't believe in the centralized      government in the United They'd rather see more of a      states-based entity that the founders originally set up where      freedoms were controlled at the local level.       I'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that      he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist      of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West really      have to look at what he's talking about as far as      traditionalism goes--particularly the sense of where it      supports the underpinnings of nationalism--and I happen to      think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good      thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong      nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and      that is really the building block that built Western Europe      and the United States, and I think it's what can see us      forward.

The Catholic Church was particularly suppressed, for nearly a fifth of all priests--over 3,000--were killed between 1939 and 1945, most in concentration camps.  From 1932 to 1933, Joseph Stalin's forced famine engulfed much of present-day Ukraine and its eastern flank. The heaviest losses were in Ukraine--which is struggling for its freedom today--which had been the most productive agricultural area of the Soviet Stalin was determined to crush all evidence of Ukrainian pride. As with Poland's leadership, the famine was accompanied by a devastating purge of all of Ukraine's intelligentsia.  Millions of peasants were condemned to death by starvation. Troops and secret police units waged a merciless war against peasants who refused to give up their grain. Any man, woman, or child caught taking even a handful of grain from a collective farm could be, and often were, executed or deported to work camps. Stalin's system of internal passports and brutal secret police forced collectivization of the land to Communist-run production.  After a long search through history and recordkeeping, I can personally give testimony and even learned that the Catholic Church located in today's Ukraine, in which our maternal grandparents were married, held a dark secret. Joseph Stalin's secret police, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, the NKVD, killed 168 people in its basement as Stalin's Black Raven trucks drove the innocents to their death.  Historians continue to seek truth even until today about what happened. Their painstaking research includes information from the Soviet archives. Though some people try to erase history or ignore it, others work diligently to record it and learn from it.  I recall how fondly our grandmother spoke of Jewish storekeepers in the region from which she emigrated, welcoming her before and after church on Sunday and telling her to change into her church shoes there before attending mass and after her 5-mile hike from her village and the 5-mile hike back. The Jewish storekeeper would always give her a piece of candy.  There are other Members here tonight that wish to speak. I am so grateful for their presence here tonight because we are the bearers of liberty's torch.

I want to tell a story in the region that I represent, though this particular neighborhood was cut out of my district. A Nazi swastika was painted on a garage door recently of the home of a Muslim family. It was really repugnant and very cruel, but what happened in our community? What did the American people do? One neighbor came over with a bottle of red paint and she made a big heart over the swastika. Then the conductor of the symphony came and musicians came, and they played ``Ode to Joy'' to the family, and other friends came and the American people.  I love the American people because deep in their hearts they live the values of liberty and justice for all. The garage door itself was replaced by the Toledo Overhead Door They gave the family a new door for free. I am just so proud of them. I am just so proud of them.  Our communities don't have to bear this sadness of anti-Semitism and of degradation by those who really don't[[Page H1238]]get what this country is made of. I know the Trump White House statement on the Holocaust falls far short of the administration's ability to properly recognize and record history accurately.  The Trump White House has the means to hire appropriate staff to prepare thoughtful, carefully researched statements, and their 2017 statement is out of touch with history. History teaches us that wherever anti-Semitism has gone unchecked, the persecution of others has been present or not far behind. Presenting historical truth and defeating anti-Semitism must be a cause of great importance not only for Jews but also for us, for people who value liberty, truth, free expression of religion, justice for all. I know that is the vast majority of the American people.

If there is any remaining time, I would just like to read a couple of the sentences of Congressman Boyle's remarks because they are so incredible.  He talks about Deborah Lipstadt, an American historian and author of influential books such as ``Denying the Holocaust,'' who wrote an important article in The Atlantic, entitled, ``The Trump Administration's Flirtation With Holocaust Denial.''  He talks about ``'hardcore Holocaust denial.' In this type of rhetoric, anti-Semites argue that the Holocaust simply did not occur; that there was no systematic plan to destroy the Jewish people based solely on their religion.  ``This type of hate speech has unfortunately been espoused by those who seek to delegitimize the suffering of the Jewish people since the Holocaust began.''  But he talks about a more insidious form of denial in rhetoric that has begun to creep into our national discussion. Lipstadt terms this ``'softcore Holocaust denial.' This form of denial, argues Lipstadt, uses different tactics but has the same end-goal. . . . It does not deny the facts, but it minimizes them, arguing that Jews use the Holocaust to draw attention away from criticism of . . .  ``Softcore denial also includes Holocaust minimization, as when someone suggests it was not so bad. Softcore denial, then, is potentially more insidious than our traditional form of denial, by minimizing the suffering of the Jewish people and suggesting that while the Holocaust may have occurred, it was not just about the Jews per se.''

If you believe in the United States military, as I do, and not simply cashing it out to private guns for hire, then we would best pay attention to Stephen Feinberg, CEO of Cerberus, who is to be tasked with leading a review of our U.intelligence agencies.  Cerberus also owns DynCorp, which is in a legal dispute over a $10 billion State Department contract for operations in foreign countries.  The Director of Homeland Security, retired General Kelly, received $166,000 as an adviser to DynCorp prior to his Cabinet appointment. Simply put, Cerberus profits off the privatization of war.  Handing the keys to our intelligence agencies over to Wall Street is dangerous. Privatization of our homeland security and Armed Forces jeopardizes our national security. It is critical we stand together, take action to demand transparency, prevail for the sake of future generations, and prevent the siphoning of funds intended for our military.  Before any Wall Street speculator sets foot on our Nation's most precious security turf, the American people and our military need complete disclosure and divestiture of all Cerberus' and Mr.Feinberg's holdings.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1280-5.txt,616,MOUNT HOOD COOPER SPUR LAND EXCHANGE CLARIFICATION ACT,2017.0,16.0,February

Court reporters play a critical role in our communities. They are the guardians of our public record. They have unique skills translating the spoken word into text to be recorded for history. They preserve judicial proceedings and assist individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing.  I have seen firsthand the dedication and professionalism shown by court reporters from my time as a special prosecutor in Wisconsin and, more importantly, from my wife Tawni, who has been a court reporter in western Wisconsin for nearly 25 years. I wish her a happy Valentine's Day today.  In addition to the critical role court reporters play in the courtroom, the National Court Reporters Association and its members have made significant contributions to the success of the Veterans History The Veterans History Project, which was created by legislation that I authored, is the largest oral history collection in the world, having collected over 100,000 stories from our Nation's veterans. Their stories are permanently stored at the Library of Congress and are available to the public.  Shortly after the Veterans History Project was launched in 2000, my wife Tawni encouraged court reporters across the country to partner with the Library of Congress to assist in transcribing veterans' stories; and to date, court reporters have submitted over 4,000 oral history transcripts to the Library of Not only have court reporters been willing to work with the Library of Congress to transcribe stories that had already been submitted, but many court reporters have personally gone and interviewed veterans in their local communities.  For example, last August, at the court reporters' national convention, the National Court Reporters Foundation celebrated Purple Heart Day by interviewing eight Purple Heart recipients for the Veterans History Additionally, the National Court Reporters Foundation recently launched a new program called the Hard-of-Hearing Heroes Project, where veterans with profound hearing loss will be interviewed for the Veterans History Project through the use of realtime captioning.

Indeed, in the proceedings before this body thus far, I think I voted for 7 or 8 or perhaps 10 of the nominees for Cabinet members who advise the  But today we are considering a nominee who is hostile to the fundamental purpose of the Agency to which he is being appointed. We are appointing a person to be the head of an Agency that is called the Environmental Protection All you need to know about the mission of that Agency is contained in the name, the Environmental Protection Agency, and we are considering a nominee who has no record that I have been able to discover of protection of the environment. No history of actions on behalf of the environment, on behalf of the health and welfare and well-being of the citizens of his State or of the United  It is bizarre, to me, to be appointing people to an office where they are hostile to the mission of the office to which they are being appointed. In fact, not only has he no record of positive environment activity, his record is completely to the contrary where he has opposed activities of the Environmental Protection  As everybody knows, as attorney general of Oklahoma and leading other attorneys general around the country, he sued the Environmental Protection Agency numerous times; I think something like 20 times. And some of those rules--all of those rules were put into place to protect the health and well-being of the American people. There are several of them that I am particularly sensitive to.  When I was the Governor of Maine, we had an issue of air quality. We still do. The reason we have an air quality issue in Maine is because of the air that is coming in on the prevailing westerly winds from the rest of the country. At one point, we had a time where we did the calculations, and we could have taken every car off our highways, closed every one of our factories, and we still would have had air quality violations on the coast of Pollution doesn't respect borders. It doesn't respect State borders, and it doesn't respect international borders. That is why it has to be a national responsibility.  Of course, each State can also have, as we do in Maine, its own department of environmental quality, its own department of environmental protection. Each State could and should and will do that and has done that, but we also need to have national standards because otherwise the States will race to the bottom: How friendly are you to business? Come on in; we have no rules. This was realized almost 50 years ago by a Senator from Maine, a Senator whose seat I occupy, a Senator whose desk I have in my office, Edmund Edmund Muskie was the father of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and he came from a State where this was not politically easy. The rivers in Maine had been grossly polluted by industrial waste. Yet he took the lead on this important issue.  Here is something extraordinary: The Clean Air Act, one of the most important environmental laws of the 20th century and very controversial, widespread impact around the country, passed this body unanimously. It is unbelievable looking back to that day. We couldn't pass the time of day unanimously in this body today, but there was bipartisan consensus that protecting the environment for ourselves and for the future of our citizens was not a political issue. It was an issue of responsibility. It was an ethical issue. And Ed Muskie, a giant in this body, created the groundwork and the legislative basis for the work we are still doing today.  In Muskie's time, the pollution was obvious. You could see it, and you could breathe it. I live on the Androscoggin River in Brunswick, and when I first went there 35 years ago,[[Page S1363]]you could smell the river in the spring. You could smell it. You knew it was spring; you could smell the foam and waste that was coming down the river. That is gone today because of the work of people like Ed  By the way, people like Howard Baker, Republicans--and in our State of Maine, the environmental movement was led by Republicans in those days. Hoddy Hildreth, David Huber, Ken McCloud, Harry Richardson--those are all prominent Republican leaders in our State who also led the environmental protection movement in our  As I said, it was easy. You could smell it; you could see it. The smog in Los Angeles was so bad that it was ridiculous, and it was unhealthful, so we took some steps that dealt with that.  We are facing an environmental threat today that is somewhat less visible--although I will argue that it is actually quite visible--but it is no less profound. In fact, I believe it is more dangerous, more threatening, more important to the future of this planet and our country and our people than those obvious threats that were faced back in 1970 and beyond.  Environmental protection, in my view, is a moral and an ethical issue; it is an intergenerational ethical issue; and it can all be summarized by what I call the main rototiller rule. The main rototiller rule goes like this: If you borrow your neighbor's rototiller in the spring in order to plow up your garden and get ready to plant, you have an obligation to return it to him in as good of shape as you got it and with a good tank of gas. That is all you need to know about environmental stewardship, because we have the planet on loan. We don't own it. We own it temporarily. We own plots of land temporarily, but we don't own the planet. We have it on loan from future generations--from our children and our grandchildren and seven generations hence. Yet our age, our generation, is acting like it is all ours, like everything is ours.  It took millions of years, for example, to create the fossil fuels that are underneath the The word ``fossil'' has a meaning. They are there because they are from fossils. It goes back literally millions of years for the Earth to distill the plant and animal matter into this miraculous substance called oil--millions of years. Yet we are using it up. Forget about the pollution for a moment; just think about the idea that we are using an asset that the Earth produced over millions of years, and in a matter of--I don't know--200 to 300 years, we are going to use it all. It is as if on Thanksgiving the turkey comes to the table, all of the family is sitting around, and Dad says: OK, I am going to eat this whole turkey. You don't get any.  What do we tell people when they look back on us in 20, 50, 100, 200 years? What are they going to think of our generation? What is our defense going to be?  We know it is not infinite. There is argument about how much is there, but it is not infinite. There is no machine in the center of the Earth that is creating these substances; therefore, we have a responsibility to future generations, as my friends in Maine would say, not to pig out on what we have and just forget about who comes next. Of course, as it becomes more rare, it will become more expensive, so we are passing those costs off as well. Beyond that is the environmental cost.  I mentioned the obvious environmental problems back in the seventies and eighties of when you could see the air, when you could smell the rivers, but today the problem is what we are doing to the planet, which is climate.  What bothers me about this nominee is he basically says: Well, it is a controversial issue. The sciences differ.  The science is clear.  Before I get to that, I have one more point about the ethical and moral responsibility.  Last year, we had Pope Francis here. Pope Francis has talked a great deal about this issue and the ethical and moral and, indeed, religious obligation we have to be good stewards of our environment and of our planet. People criticized the They said: Let the Pope stick to religion and stay away from science.  It turns out that the Pope is a chemist. That is an unfortunate fact.  When the Pope was here, I did a little act of Jesus in the Good Book and found a number of references to the responsibility we have to protect the environment and the land. Indeed, in the Old Testament--and we all know about the Sabbath, that on the seventh day, He rested. There is a provision in the Old Testament whereby every 7 years the people were instructed to let the land lie fallow for a year--a Sabbath for the land in order to preserve its productivity.  I believe this is fundamentally an ethical issue. What do we owe our children--to just forge ahead in the face of overwhelming science and all of the predictions? What is happening in the world around us is selfishness. It is unethical. It is wrong. It is unfair.  As I said, we are talking about a nominee for this body who says the debate about climate change is just that--it is a debate.       There are scientists that agree, and there are scientists      that don't agree to the extent of man's contribution and      whether it is even harmful at this point.  Give me a break. The scientific community is virtually unanimous, and, indeed, the data is unanimous.  I carry a little card around with me. This is a blowup of it. I am a visual person--I like to see things, and I understand them better. To me, this is what you need to know about what is going on.  By the way, what this is, is CO2 in the atmosphere, parts per million, for 800,000 years. People say: Well, it has varied over time. It goes up and down. It is just a natural cycle.  It does vary over time. Here is 850,000 years, and you can see that it varies from a low of about 180 parts per million up close to 300 parts per million, and that is the variation. Absolutely true. That is the variation until you get to about 1860, and that is when it starts to go up. Now we are at 400 parts per million, which is 25 percent higher than it has been in 5 million years. Was it a coincidence that it started to happen when we started to burn fossil fuels in such vast quantities? Of course not. Was there a big outburst of volcanos in the mid-1800s? Of course not.  This is not debatable. These are measurements. These are scientific measurements. Debating this is like debating that water boils at 212 degrees: Oh, no. I think it boils at 214 degrees.  It is 210.  It is 212.  Light travels at 186,000 miles a second. That is not debatable. Neither is this.  We are in a very dangerous place. Scott Pruitt calls it an argument and doesn't want to do anything about it. Not only does he not want to do anything about it, he wants to undo the things that have been done to try to protect us.  You can look at this chart and say CO2 is going up. It is invisible gas. You cannot taste it. You cannot smell it. It does not poison us. It is in the atmosphere anyway. Who cares? What difference does it make?  Here is what difference it makes. This is the other side of my little card. This is the correlation of over 800,000 years between temperature and Of what you can see, the blue is the CO2, and the temperature is red, and what you see is an almost exact correlation. It is beyond coincidence. When CO2 goes up, the temperature goes up. When CO2 goes down, the temperature goes down. You can see it over the time. Do you know where we are now in CO2? The correlation is unmistakable, it is powerful, and it is dangerous.  The nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency denies this. He says it is a debate. Just for a moment, let's take him at his word. Let's say it is a debate. Let's say it is not entirely settled. If the risk is so catastrophic, wouldn't it be prudent to try to take some measures to prevent it even if you are not sure? By the time we are sure--by the way, we are sure now. By the time Scott Pruitt is sure, it will be too late. It may already be too late. We may be beyond the tipping point, and all we can do is mitigate the danger, not stop it altogether, because we have been heedless of the consequences of the results that will impact the next generation of Americans and of people around the world.  What are the consequences going to be? What if it gets a little bit warmer? We will be able to play golf longer in Maine--hey, not bad--but the consequences in many cases are going to[[Page S1364]]be catastrophic. There are many already affecting Maine in terms of where our lobster population is moving.  I had a sea farmer in my office 2 days ago, a fellow who has a great business. He has grown it for years. It is really a serious business of growing oysters, and he has always grown them in the Damariscotta In fact, if you go to a fancy restaurant and ask for Damariscotta River oysters there, they are the top-level oysters in the world. He has always grown them in the river. He puts in the little seed. They start in little, tiny shells, and then they grow out. He can no longer grow them initially in the river because the water is so acidic from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is absorbed by the ocean, that the shells don't grow. He had to move the incubation part of his business onshore and treat the water to lower the acidity so that the shells will grow, and then when they get a certain size, he puts them back in the river.  This is a real, direct, obvious, observable effect of global climate change and of too much CO2 in the atmosphere. It is not theoretical. It is not debatable. It is not that scientists differ. This guy is trying to make a living, and he can only do it by treating the water because the acid that has been created by the ocean in its absorbing the CO2 is making it impossible for the oysters to develop. That is a direct impact. Probably the most direct impact we are going to be able to see and identify and not avoid is sea level rise.  Last summer--as a matter of fact, in August--I went to Let me just put that in context. It is the continent of The ice on Greenland, if and when it melts--and I think it is when, not if--will add 61 feet to the ocean depth. The ice in Antarctica has 212 feet of sea level rise contained in it. Just think about that for a minute. Greenland is melting at a rate no one has seen before. I saw it with my own eyes. I saw these big things in the ice. We helicoptered out over the ice sheet, and you could see these big holes in the ice called moulins. Into those moulins are flowing, rushing rivers of meltwater. You can see them. They are blue, and they run across the ice and down into the hole, and they go all the way down to the bottom, 2 miles thick, where they lubricate the space between the ice and the land and accelerate the ice in its moving toward the ocean. ``Accelerate.'' That is an important term. That is a term I heard at the University of Maine from their climate scientists. That is a term I have heard from scientists in other parts of the country. ``Accelerate.'' ``Abrupt.''  We all think of things changing very slowly; as a matter of fact, the very term glacial means ``moving slowly.'' Not anymore. We went to the Jakobshavn Glacier, the largest glacier that is draining the ice sheet of Greenland, and it has retreated as much in the past 10 years as in the prior 100 years. It has retreated as much in the past 10 years as in the prior 100 years. Do the math, and that is 10 times the rate that the ice is flowing off the Greenland ice sheet into the ocean and raising sea levels.  One of the problems with what is going on now is the process of acceleration. For example, everybody knows that the ice in the Arctic Ocean is disappearing at an unprecedented rate. A cruise ship went through the Arctic Ocean last summer. The Arctic Ocean has been closed throughout human history. It has been unavailable for commerce. You couldn't get through. It was always covered with ice. In the summer it would clear a little bit. Now we are talking about international trade through the Arctic  What happens, though, scientifically, when the sun's rays hit the ice and the snow, 85 percent of the energy of the sun is bounced back. That is science. When the ice is gone and the dark ocean is available, 85 percent of the sun's energy is absorbed into the ocean. That is called a feedback loop. That accelerates. The more it melts, the more it gets melted, and that is the kind of thing that is happening in Greenland, in Antarctica, and, indeed, all over the world.  Here is something I learned on my trip to Greenland that I really hadn't absorbed. If there is anything we think of as a constant, it is the ocean. You walk down to the beach in Maine or on to the dock in Portland, you look out, and you see it. There it is. It is the way it has always been. It turns out it has always been that way for only 8,000 years. It happens to have always been that way when people have been around and keeping records and taking pictures, but it hasn't always been that way.  Here is an amazing bit of science that, frankly, I wasn't aware of. This is the ocean depth 24,000 years ago. This is the ocean depth today. So 24,000 years ago, it was 390 feet shallower than it is today. It was 390 feet shallower 24,000 years ago. Why 24,000 years ago? Because all the water was locked up in the glaciers. In one sense, Greenland and Antarctica are the last remnants of the glaciers, and they are now melting.  This period, 24,000 years up to today, is how the oceans have risen. You can see coincidentally, it has been pretty fixed for 8,000 years, and that is why we think it is going to always be that way. I used to teach about the recency effect. All human beings tend to think that what happened last week is going to happen next week. But this tells us that the ocean level is variable.  Here is the amazing spot, right here. It is called the meltwater pulse 1A; all geologists know about this. And if you do the calculation on this period, the ocean gained about a foot a decade. It got deeper. The sea level rose about a foot a decade during this period, and this is what we are facing right now.  The best estimates I have been able to obtain are that we are facing about a foot to a foot and a half of sea level rise in the next 15 years, and a foot a decade thereafter for the rest of the century. If you do the math, that is an additional 6 to 8 feet.  In fact, there was an estimate just released last week that says it is more like 9 feet, 3 meters. Nine feet? Miami is gone; New Orleans, gone; New York, under deep threat; Bangladesh--we are talking about national security here because the people who are going to be pressed into migration because of this are going to create a national security and a migration crisis, the likes of which this country and the world has never seen. We are talking about 1 million or 2 million people out of Syria, and it has caused great uproar here and in The estimates are for the migration from climate change in the reasonably foreseeable future to be 200 million to 500 million people. Think of the national security implications of that.  And here we are debating a nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency who says: Well, it is debatable; maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  It is not debatable. This is happening. And for us to ignore it and to approve this nominee who is hostile, who has sued the Agency, and who has never done a thing in his life to protect the environment, is just outrageous. It is a dereliction of our responsibility, and we are going to look back on this moment and say: What were we thinking?  I understand that the President won. Elections have results. He can move in the direction he wants to on policy, but this is beyond policy. This is just fundamentally irresponsible to our children, to their children, and the future of this country.  So I hope, after this debate and after this discussion, the people of this body will come together--just as they did with the Secretary of Labor nominee, who really wasn't appropriate--and say the same thing.  Plus, finally--I will just note this as a parenthetical--there is the issue of the emails in and out of this fellow's office when he was attorney general that they have been hiding for 2\1/2\ years or 3 years that may well become available in a week. If I were someone contemplating voting for this fellow, I sure as heck would want to wait until I saw these emails because there may be things there that are going to be profoundly embarrassing, if not worse.  So there is no reason to move this nomination today, and there is no reason, in my view, to move this nomination at all.  I understand that the EPA can overreach--any agency can overreach--and there should be control on regulations. I have worked on regulatory reform since I have been here, but there is a difference between regulatory reform and a wrecking ball to the fundamental protections that have made so much difference to the people of this country.  So I hope we will consider the future in our vote today--not just ourselves,[[Page S1365]]not just the regulations, not just a few people who may be profiting by the exploitation of these resources, but think about our kids, our grandchildren, and our ultimate responsibility to this country.  Thank you, Madam  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1724,1415,2017.0,16.0,February
991,topic-id,3463,"Mr.President, I want to first thank Senator Carper for his leadership today, and I rise today[[Page S1264]]to join him in speaking about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection  I will not be voting in favor of Mr.Pruitt's nomination for EPA Administrator because of his record and views on issues that are very important to the people of my State--issues like climate change, which matters in Minnesota, and issues like the Renewable Fuel I am not sure everyone has focused on that today, but I think it is important, especially for States in the Midwest, to focus on what his record has been on this issue.  Mr.Pruitt has written that the climate change debate is ``far from settled'' and has made other troubling comments about climate change. I could not disagree more. I believe that the debate on whether climate change is happening is over. The facts are in, and the science is clear.  The ``2014 National Climate Assessment'' stated the most recent decade was the Nation's warmest on record. U.temperatures are expected to continue to rise. It was drafted by over 300 authors and extensively reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences and a Federal advisory committee of 60 members.  The ``Quadrennial Defense Review 2014'' of the Department of Defense of the United States stated: ``The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world.''  Climate change isn't just about melting glaciers and rising ocean levels, although it is certainly about that. It is also about what we have experienced in the When I first got to the Senate, I remember hearing from experts, including people in our own Defense Department and major military leaders who talked about the fact that one of the consequences of climate change will be, first of all, all over the world in economies that are already struggling. We are going to see some of those developing nations encounter unpredictable weather--hurricanes, tsunamis.  In the Midwest, while we may not have tsunamis, what we see is major, unpredictable weather, which is just as dangerous. We have seen the devastating impacts of natural disasters like Hurricane Matthew, and we have seen flooding from Cedar Rapids and  We now know the risk of climate change to Minnesota, to our country, and to our planet. We must reduce greenhouse gas and tackle the challenge of global climate change head-on. If we don't tackle this issue, we are going to continue to struggle with the far-reaching economic and environmental consequences.  Shifting global trends have the potential to wreak more long-term havoc on our businesses and our industries. That is why businesses in my State--major companies like Cargill and General Mills--have been willing to take this on, have been willing to talk about this as a problem. They see this as a moral obligation to their employees and their customers, but they also see it as part of their business. They can't simply continue in business and serve people all over the world if major economies could be ruined by one storm or if we see areas flooded that are on our coast or the kind of weather we have seen in the It is bad for business, and they are willing to admit that.  As a Senator from Minnesota with a strong ag industry and also a tradition of hunting and fishing, I see climate change as a direct threat to my State's economy for recreation. It is also a threat to our State's heritage of enjoying the outdoors, whether that is snowmobiling or whether that is our wildlife. We have seen some major changes to the wildlife in our  I have always believed that an ``all of the above'' plan is necessary to build a new energy agenda for America, but it must be an agenda that recognizes the challenges of climate change. Someone who heads up the EPA must believe in science. It is an Agency grounded in science.  Mr.Pruitt has also been quoted as saying ``the ethanol fuel mandate is unworkable.'' I know he has changed some of his views since he was nominated, but I, as a Senator from a State that relies on renewable fuels as one of our major industries in the ag part of our State, must look at his entire record and what he has actually said when he has been in positions of power.  How do I see the Renewable Fuel Standard? The Renewable Fuel Standard has led to important advancements in clean energy, and the standard has provided stability and predictability that have and will continue to drive long-term investments in the renewable space.  Every time a new study is released on the subject, I become even more convinced that investments in renewable fuels are investments in the future health of our economy and our environment. A recent study by ABF Economics showed that the ethanol industry generated $7.37 billion in gross sales in 2015 for Minnesota businesses and $1.6 billion in income for Minnesota households. Here is a big one: The ethanol industry also supports over 18,000 full-time jobs in  Senators on both sides of the aisle understand that renewable fuels are important as a home-grown economic generator. They also are about 10 percent of our fuel supply in the United That is a competitor for oil. When we have that kind of competition, that allows us to have everything from electric cars to other kinds of renewables, and we should not simply rely on the oil industry to fuel our vehicles. Renewable fuels are an important competitor.  As I mentioned, there is strong bipartisan support for renewable fuels. I have worked closely with many friends across the aisle for many years on this issue. And, of course, the further ethanol and renewable fuels take us, the less dependent we will be on foreign oil. We need and want a mixed fuel supply.  Now is not the time to waiver on support for renewable fuels. The EPA Administrator has many flexibilities under the law to slow or make changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard, and that is why I am concerned about the past record of this nominee on this important issue.  Another reason we need consistent and effective leadership at the EPA is in the fight to maintain and restore the Great Our Great Lakes contain 90 percent of our Nation's supply of fresh surface water and supply drinking water to 30 million And our economy? The Great Lakes' combined economic impact is so enormous that restoration alone is estimated to provide $50 billion in long-term economic benefits. That is why last year's Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act reauthorized the Great Lakes Restoration These projects have helped eliminate toxins from our waters, combat invasive species--something very critical in my State with invasive carp--protect against pollution, restore habitats for fish and wildlife, and promote the overall health.  The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for leading efforts to implement, administer, and distribute grant funding across agencies that undertake restoration activities. As I noted, Minnesota is home to a thriving outdoor economy that relies on clean water, free of invasive species. It is vital that our next EPA Administrator continue to take action to stop the spread of invasive carp before they reach the Great Lakes and many of our most important northern waters.  My background? My grandpa was an iron ore miner. He worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines most of his life. Every day when he went down in that cage, he would always think about what he would like to do in the outdoors. He loved to hunt. About once a year, they would borrow a car from my uncle. They would go to see Lake Superior, and he would bring his sons to see Lake  I want an EPA Administrator that sees that, yes, you want a strong economy, and yes, those things can work together with the environment, but you also need to preserve that outdoors and wildlife and those Great Lakes my grandpa and my family hold so dear.  Mr.Pruitt has articulated extreme views about the role of the EPA, but there is a bigger problem here. We still don't know his full views and record. My colleagues who sat on the Environment and Public Works Committee have asked Mr.Pruitt to produce critical documents that will clarify his record and vision for the EPA, and 19 times, Mr.Pruitt told Senators they should get the information from his attorney general's office. Well, they tried[[Page S1265]]and they have not succeeded. The Oklahoma attorney general's office told them that they have a 2-year backlog for such requests. In committee questions for the record, my colleagues asked Mr.Pruitt to clear the backlog and provide the committee with these communications. Once again, he declined. Mr.Pruitt has not provided the Senate with the information we need to make an informed decision about his nomination.  The EPA Administrator will be entrusted with protecting the health and well-being of This is a tremendous responsibility. That is why Americans deserve a clear picture of Mr.Pruitt's record on protecting public health, clean air, and clean water, including a review of the emails that were ordered to be released today.                                 Russia  Now, Mr.President, I would like to turn to another topic. Actually, after watching parts of the President's lengthy and unpredictable news conference today, I came upon some of the parts dealing with I thought it was important that I come down to the floor and address them.  The part of the press conference that I saw was where the President referred to the reporting that has been done on Russia as fake news. The reporting that has been done about all of the contacts between members of his campaign and the Russian intelligence agencies--I assume he includes the reporting that has been done on the phone call that was made to the Russian Ambassador--and the various other reporting that we have seen--that is very troubling about this administration's dealing with Russia from the campaign time, to the transition, to the present.  I would just like to say that this is far from fake news; this is fact. And if you don't believe it is fact, then that means you don't believe 17 U.intelligence agencies and that instead you take the word of Russians, Russian intelligence and Putin's word. I go with our 17 U.intelligence agencies that have made it very clear that Russia had been attempting to influence our election.  This was borne out to me when Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and I visited the Baltics, Ukraine, and Georgia at the end of last year in What we saw there and what we heard there makes us know that this is not just one single incident of Russia trying to influence one candidate's campaign or even one election or even one country's election, but that this is a modus operandi, that they have done this before. They did it in Estonia when they were mad that they moved a statue. What did they do? They shut down their internet. They did it in Lithuania when the Lithuanians had the audacity to invite members of the Ukrainian Parliament who were in exile because they were part of the legally annexed Lithuania invites them to their 25th anniversary celebration of their independence from What happens? Russia attacks the accounts of members of the Lithuanian  I have already expressed deep concern about this administration's lack of transparency on a variety of critical issues, but nowhere is this more true than when it comes to this administration's interactions with the Russian For months, U.intelligence agencies have said that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda--$200 million worth--to try to undermine our democracy. Reports show it and the facts prove it.  Unlike what the President said today at the press conference, this is not fake news. Last week, in fact, we learned that the very day President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for their unprecedented attacks on our democracy, a member of the Trump transition team spoke to a senior Russian official regarding those sanctions and then did not tell the truth about it. The National Security Advisor--the person charged with the most sensitive matters of U.national security--misled the Vice President and, in turn, the American people. We have now seen two people resign: the campaign manager for Trump's campaign and the National Security And one of the things they have in common is Russia and a relationship with  So, no, this is not what the President said at his press conference today or earlier in a tweet. This is not about some kind of sour grapes--those were not his words but his implication about the loss of Hillary That is not what this is. This is not about her loss in the last campaign. These are facts that have emerged since that time that I think are important to everyone.  I appreciated the words a few months ago from Senator Rubio, who said that this is not about one campaign, this is not about one election, because it could quickly turn on the other party. We have an obligation as Senators to protect our democracy. That is what this is about--to make sure we have fair and free elections that are not influenced by foreign governments.  Today, Secretary Mattis said that Russia's behavior is aggressive and destabilizing. I thought that was a good caricature of not only what we have seen in our own country but also what we have seen overseas. And then he went on to say that right now we are not negotiating from a position of strength. Well, that is certainly true when our own President then, a few hours later, takes to the stage and says that this is simply fake news and that we are talking about Russia's aggression as some kind of response to the loss in the last campaign.  We need to know the full extent of the administration's contact with the Russian Government during the campaign and transition, including what was said, what was done, and who knew about it. Only then will we answer that fourth ``w.'' Who, what, where--it is the only way we are going to answer why. Why is this administration so focused on trying to placate Russia?  I recently joined Senators Cardin, Leahy, Feinstein, and Carper--this was early January--to introduce legislation that would create an independent, nonpartisan commission to look at the facts and to make recommendations about how we can handle future elections so they will be free and safeguarded from foreign interference. This would, of course, be in addition to the thorough investigation that I have been ensured will occur with the Intelligence Committee under the leadership of Senators Burr and  In the last few weeks, we have heard a lot about the three branches of government and our system of checks and balances. One of the fundamental jobs of Congress is to closely oversee the executive branch to ensure that the law is being properly followed and enforced. I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand how important that is.  I am the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, and one of our jobs is to oversee our election system. A big part of my job as the Democratic leader of this committee will be to ensure that our election system is safe from foreign interference in the future.  Intelligence experts have been clear: Russian interference in our 2016 election was not an anomaly. The threat of future tampering is real and immediate. As Senator Rubio said and I just noted, this time it was the Democrats who were attacked. Next time it could be a And it is not something that is limited to one party. Future threats could come in the form of more misinformation. They could range from using social media to disrupt the voting process to even hacking into State reporting websites to alter vote totals. Russia's goal is to create confusion and undermine people's trust in our democratic institutions. That is why they spent $200 million last year to fund the spread of fake news.  We need solutions and not more problems. Just last week, the House voted to eliminate the Election Assistance Commission, the only Federal agency charged with protecting American elections from hacking. As ranking member of the Rules Committee, I find this unconscionable. We have to do more, not less, to protect American elections from foreign interference.  The EAC and the Department of Homeland Security were in communication with State election officials prior to election day promoting cyber security best practices. Our agencies have ensured that safeguards, like provisional ballots, would allow people to cast ballots even if their systems were hacked. We have to do more, not less, to support this effort. That is why I am currently developing legislation that[[Page S1266]]will protect our elections from foreign interference. We are going to work with the EAC, DHS, and all 50 States to protect voting systems and registration data bases from cyber security threats. We will also make sure State and local election officials have the resources they need to make these critical cyber security upgrades.  Recent news events show us just how severe the problem is. Now we have to come up with the solutions. My Republican colleague, Senator McCain, got it right yesterday when he said this. This gets to the security issue that goes even beyond our elections:       General Flynn's resignation also raises further questions      about the Trump administration's intentions toward Vladimir      Putin's Russia, including statements by the president      suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and      Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea,      and threats to our NATO allies.  The day that the Obama administration was imposing sanctions on Russia--and the Trump campaign was allegedly undermining those sanctions--I was with Senators McCain and Graham in Eastern The goal of our trip was to reenforce support for NATO and our allies in the face of increased Russian aggression. We visited the Baltics, Ukraine, and Georgia--countries on the frontlines of this fight, and they know Russia's playbook well.  In our meetings with Presidents and Prime Ministers of those countries, it was increasingly evident that if we don't stop Russia now, cyber attacking against governments, political parties, newspapers, and companies will only get worse.  This is a pattern of waging cyber attacks and military invasions against democratic governments across the world. Ukraine itself has been targeted by Russian hackers more than 6,500 times in just the past 2 months--earlier I used the examples of Estonia and Lithuania, but 6,500 times in just the past 2 months. Now we have evidence that Russia is working to undermine the elections in France and  This is not just about defending our own democracy; it is about defending the democratic way of life and democracies across the world. We must be a united front in fighting Russian aggression, and we must make it clear to Russia that there are consequences to their actions. That is why I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to introduce the Countering Russian Hostilities Act, legislation that would impose strong actions against These sanctions would address cyber attacks, human rights violations, and the illegal annexation of land in Ukraine and  The world continues to look to America for its steadfast, steady leadership. The United States, a beacon for freedom and democracy, must continue to stand up against Russian aggression. The leader of our country should not be calling those reports that have been substantiated by 17 U.intelligence agencies ``fake news.'' That is what happened today.  On New Years' Eve, together with Ukrainian President Poroshenko and Senators McCain and Graham, we stood at the border of eastern Ukraine, 2 years after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, 2 years after the invasion of eastern Ukraine, 10,000 lives lost.  Ukrainian soldiers stood, and they have continued to stand, protecting their homeland and defending their democracy. For years, our allies have been subject to aggression and invasions, but they are undeterred, unwilling to give up what they fought so hard for: independence, freedom, and democracy. If we are committed to ensuring that Russia's hacking invasions and blackmail do not go unchecked, we must do everything in our power to uncover the full extent of this interference in our own political system. As our allies stand there every day losing people on the frontlines, looking to us for support, looking to us, we cannot turn our own backs on an invasion--a cyber invasion on our own democracy. We must also stand up for independence, freedom, and democracy.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Young).

This would exempt any regulations that affect the safety of our National Airspace  It is important to note that commercial drone operations are only possible because of FAA rules. Last August, the FAA's small UAS rule--unmanned aerial systems rule--opened the door for small businesses to use unmanned systems easily and without cumbersome paperwork.[[Page H1382]]  The current inaction on the ``flights over people'' rule could limit UAS operations, such as news reporting, disaster relief, and public safety from becoming a reality. As a result, many businesses and the country could lose out on the full societal and economic benefits of  Once UAS are fully integrated into the national airspace, the full benefits of these tools will help businesses to expand and our economy to grow--with a projected 100,000 jobs and over $82 billion in economic impact over the next decade. That is why this particular amendment is supported by the UAV Coalition as well as the Automated Vehicles  But we need action from regulatory authorities to fully integrate UAS into our airspace. Without my amendment, the SCRUB Act has the potential to stifle a growing industry and prevent the modernization of air traffic.

993,topic-id,2750,"Mr.President, it is an absolute honor to be able to rise and speak in support of Attorney General Scott For the last 6 years, Scott has been a leader in the State of He has been strongly committed to enforcing the law in Oklahoma as it is written and as is consistent with the He is a statesman. He is a dedicated public servant.  As the Administrator of the EPA, I fully expect Scott to be able to lead the Agency to follow every environmental law and to partner with States, local authorities, and tribes to do what is best for the present and for the future. I have heard some people talk about their opposition to Scott's nomination, saying they don't believe Scott believes in clean air, in clean water.  That is not the issue for Scott absolutely believes in clean air and clean water, and the accusations that somehow he wants dirty air and dirty water and our children to be poisoned is ludicrous.  The question for Scott is not if we should have clean air and clean water, it is who is the primary steward of our clean air and our clean water. Everyone has a role. We are a nation that is connected to each other. What happens in one State does affect another That is why we have a national strategy working with the Environmental Protection Agency, but in the Clean Water Act and in the Clean Air Act, the States are given primary responsibility through what is called a State Implementation Plan to determine what is in their best interests and the best solutions to be able to deal with the issues of air and water.  Scott has fought for the State to be allowed to be in the driver's seat with regard to all of the State resources, arguing for those that work in wind farms, in oilfields, and on cattle ranches, for families who have drinking water and breathe the air and who live there. The people who should have the loudest voices should be the people who actually drink that water and breathe that air and understand the effects of it firsthand.  He has not been alone in this fight. As the attorney general of Oklahoma, he stood shoulder to shoulder with more than half of the States to ensure the Federal Government operates within the bounds of the statutes and the He has consistently argued that the EPA, when they promulgate rules that violate that basic principle of the State Implementation Plan, should stop, do what the EPA does best, and have the EPA push the States to do what they should do best.  In an environment where Chevron deference is the precedent set, it is critical that the leader of an Agency that has such wide latitude to extract costs out of the economy, should respect the federalist foundation we have, and the pocketbooks of hard-working families, as well as our air and our water.  In previous congressional testimony, he stressed the importance of laws like the Clean Air Act, stressing that the intention was for States to work together under a model of cooperative federalism that protects the environment while considering economic costs.  Scott pursued cases against the EPA and other Federal agencies in an effort to enable and embolden our State government officials to craft the legislation that needs to be done. His focus has been not to eliminate environmental protections, it is to honor a country with tremendous diversity, from rocky mountains to open deserts, to beautiful woodland areas.  Surprisingly enough, the issues that we face on our environment, in the concrete jungle of Washington, DC, is different than it is in Woodward, Let me give you an example of one of those cases that he engaged in. It is a case where the EPA created a new regulation called waters of the United It dramatically changed the definition of what are the areas the EPA can oversee and increased their regulatory authority by millions of acres in just one regulatory sweep.  The courts immediately stepped in and stopped this, and Scott Pruitt and many other States' attorneys general said: The EPA does not have the right to be able to step into almost every inch of our State and say they suddenly have regulatory authority.  In fact, the court said this: ``We conclude that petitioners have demonstrated a substantial possibility of success on the merits of their claims.''  Furthermore, they said this: ``What is of greater concern to us, in balancing the harms, is the burden--potentially visited nationwide on government bodies, state and federal, as well as private parties.''  The court stepped in and agreed with Scott Pruitt that the EPA was overreaching, and that case is still in the courts right now. That is a reasonable thing to be able to do, for an attorney general who has the responsibility to not only manage the legal issues of the State but also to watch out for the consumers of the As funny as it sounds, if you go to the EPA's website today and look at Oklahoma and air quality, here is what it says. The EPA website today reads: ``CAA permitting in Clean Air Act permitting in Oklahoma is the responsibility of the Air Quality Division Exit of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.''  The EPA's website today says responsibility for this is from the Department of Environmental Quality in  All our attorney general has done is said to the EPA: You should probably follow the law or at least your own website to be able to handle all of the permitting issues of who has authority to do this. For the past month, I have heard Senator after Senator come to this floor and describe my great State of Oklahoma in a way that makes Scott Pruitt sound like an ogre and my State sound like a toxic waste dump.  Let me give you an example. Attorney General Pruitt has been dismissed by some who say that he has personally been engaged in leading our State to such terrible air quality that the American Lung Association has given the counties in Oklahoma an F rating.  Well, that is an interesting accusation, until you actually go to the American Lung Association website[[Page S1268]]and see that they give almost every county in America an F rating. In fact, they give every county in Delaware an F rating in air quality. They categorize those under ``high ozone days'' and one of three counties just barely skated by with a D in particle pollution for Delaware, while in Oklahoma the two largest metropolitan areas actually received an A from the American Lung Similarly, in that same study, Rhode Island lacks a single county that doesn't get an F for air quality on high ozone days, while only two counties received passing grades for particulate pollution.  The accusation that somehow the American Lung Association has looked at Scott Pruitt and his record on environmental policy and has given us dirty air quality is not actually true when you see the full study.  What is interesting, as well, is that the EPA publishes data about whether counties meet the national ambient air quality standards, and they have six criteria that the EPA puts out. In fact, recently they dropped their criteria significantly from the previous years. What is interesting, as well, is that for Oklahoma, last week, the EPA released their national ambient air quality standards, trying to determine which counties had attainment of the standard or nonattainment. Guest what. Every single county in Oklahoma--all 77--have attainment. Even as to the new standard that was just released, that we don't even have to operate under, we already meet those standards for ambient air quality.  Meanwhile, Maryland has 12 counties in nonattainment for at least 1 of those criteria. Connecticut has eight counties that don't meet those standards. California has 38 of their 58 counties failing to meet those standards in at least 1 criteria. There are 77 counties in Oklahoma, and every single one of them meets attainment.  I don't hear anyone standing on this floor challenging the attorney general of California or of Maryland or of Connecticut and demonizing them and accusing them of not taking care of the air and the water in their  By the way, I have also heard on this floor, as my State is being ripped apart for political gain, over and over that asthma rates for children are catastrophically high in Oklahoma and that Scott Pruitt should have been more engaged, filing lawsuits so that asthma rates would go down--until you look at the CDC website for asthma rates for children. It is 10.1 in One child is too many. It is 10.1 percent in our State, but you can compare that to Rhode Island, which is 12.4; or Michigan, which is 10.7. Vermont beat us, by the way. They are 9.9--0.2 below us.  Again, I don't hear anyone on this floor calling out the attorneys general of Vermont, Michigan, and Rhode Island and saying they failed to protect their children because children have asthma in their  Another thing that is commonly said about Scott Pruitt and the State of Oklahoma is that he is committed to conventional energy sources and that he is stuck in the past, dealing with oil and gas.  I will tell you that Oklahoma is rightfully right proud of its history of oil and gas in our We have unlocked resources that have absolutely powered our Nation forward. We also have an incredible group of visionaries in our State that are driving renewable resources as fast as we are driving oil and gas in our  For all the folks that are here bashing oil and gas, I would remind you that you traveled to Washington, DC, on a plane, in a car, or on a train that was powered by Oklahoma energy. So you are welcome. And I will assume that, 2 weeks from now, when we return back for session, you are going to ride in on a horse just to be able to spite Oklahoma's energy--probably not. But can I remind you of something?  What is often overlooked about Oklahoma and what has not been stated here is that Oklahoma truly is an all-of-the-above energy State--solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, oil, gas, and coal.  Let me give you an example--just one of the examples from that. Recent data shows that Oklahoma ranks third nationally in total wind power. We just passed California for total wind production. We are just barely behind Iowa and The installed capacity for Oklahoma alone--just in wind generation--is 1.3 million households powered by wind power out of  I will admit that I am a little biased about my But I am weary of hearing people inaccurately demean the air and water in Oklahoma and try to accuse it of something that is not true for their political benefit.  Here is my invitation to any Member of this body. Why don't you come home to Oklahoma with me? I will buy you some great barbecue and drive you around the I will take you through the Green Country in the northeast part of the State, over to Kenton, OK, and Black Mesa to see the majestic area around our panhandle. We will drive four-wheelers in Little Sahara, and maybe we will drive down to Beavers Bend Park, stand under the tall trees, and put our feet in the crystal clear water of that river. I will even take you to my house in Oklahoma City, a community of a million people that exceeds the EPA air quality standards for ambient air quality.  We say in Oklahoma: ``The land we belong to is grand,'' and we mean it. We are passionate about our land, and we are passionate about our air and water. I will tell you that Scott Pruitt is passionate about his State and what we do there.  I will tell you how political this has really become. Mike Turpen is the former attorney general of the State of Oklahoma and, by the way, he is also the former chairman of the Oklahoma Democratic Mike Turpen, when it was announced that Scott Pruitt was going to be tapped to be head of the EPA, released this statement:       Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is a good choice to      head up the Environmental Protection I am convinced      Scott Pruitt will work to protect our natural habitats,      reserves and resources. His vision for a proper relationship      between protection and prosperity makes him superbly      qualified to serve as our next EPA administrator.  That is from the former head of the Oklahoma Democratic  So far, my colleagues have found a good reason for every Cabinet nominee to delay, delay, delay. This has now been the slowest confirmation process for any President since George The tradition has always been that the President won an election, and he should be able to hire his own staff and his own Cabinet and get busy going to work. That is what the American people asked him to do.  Scott Pruitt deserves an up-or-down vote, and he deserves our trust to be able to take on and follow the law, doing what the EPA requires him to do.  Scott Pruitt is a friend. I understand that some of the folks who have attacked him have only met him at a hearing or read about him on some blog site. But I have prayed with I have seen Scott struggle with the hard decisions that affect our State's future. I have seen Scott listen to people from all sides of an issue, and I have seen him take difficult stands. I think he will be an excellent EPA Administrator, and I think he will make some wise choices to not only protect what is happening now but to be able to help protect us for the future.  You see, Scott is a husband and a dad as well, and he cares also about the future of our country. I think he is going to go after it, and he will be able to be an excellent Administrator in the days ahead.                         Tribute to Bryan Berky  Mr.President, I would like to take a quick moment just to be able to reflect. I have a staff member named Bryan He is running off. He has been quite a leader. He is leaving us to be able to take on a new task and a new role.  Since 2010, he has been a tremendous asset to the Bryan Berky is a student of Senate procedures. He is the one in the office whom everyone wishes they had because, when something comes up and someone has some novel new idea of how the rules work, he is typically the one on the corner saying: Yes, that really won't work, and here is why.  He has been sharp on budget issues, on tax issues, and efficiency in government. He has been the one who has been passionate about the national debt--and not just talking about national debt but actually trying to solve it.  You see, Bryan Berky is one of those unique staffers not trying to make a[[Page S1269]]point. He is trying to actually solve the problem.  He was mentored by a guy named Tom Coburn, who wasn't too bad on those issues himself. He has led well, and I am proud that he has been on my staff.  As he leaves from the Senate, he will be sorely missed by this whole body--even by people who never met him. He had an impact, based on the things that he worked on.  If you want to get a chance to visit with Bryan Berky, though, you can talk about Senate procedures, tax policy, and nerdy budget issues or you can chat with him about Oklahoma State football. He spent his time through college working for the Oklahoma State football team, watching the films and breaking down every single play, preparing the team for practice and for the game days.  He is a great student of people and of process.  I just want to be able to pass on to the Presiding Officer that there is a guy named Bryan Berky who is leaving the Senate in the next week, and he will be sorely missed by this Senate and by our team in the days ahead.

247,topic-id,1709,"Mr.President, we have heard a lot about President Trump's admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom most objective observers regard as a murderous thug and a kleptocrat. As we consider the President's statements lauding Putin for being a ``strong leader'' and his silence about the imprisonment and assassinations of Putin's critics and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, and atrocities in Syria, I am reminded of the remarks delivered on December 13 by Samantha Power, former Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the U.Security  Ambassador Power delivered a passionate appeal to the Security Council to take action to protect civilians under assault in Aleppo, including to hold in contempt the governments of Syria, Russia, and Iran for their war crimes in Her remarks stand as a stark contrast to what we are hearing from the White House today. This is a time to condemn Vladmir Putin's aggressions against the people of Russia, of Ukraine, and of Syria--not to regard him as an example of a leader to emmulate.  It is also a time for Republicans to stand up for our own democracy, after the Russian Government, at Putin's direction, actively sought to sway the outcome of the U.Presidential election. The unanimous conclusion of U.intelligence agencies is that Putin, a former KGB agent, ordered a cyber attack on our electoral system in favor of Donald Russia's goals ``were to undermine public faith in the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.'' Yet the White House and Republican leaders in Congress have been silent, apparently unconcerned about a foreign assault on our electoral system, refusing to even support an independent investigation. Imagine what they would be saying if their candidate had lost. They would be demanding a new election and trying to shut down the government.  I ask unanmious consent that Ambassador Power's remarks be printed in the Record to serve as a reminder of the scale of the humanitarian disaster in Syria perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin and our moral obligation to pursue accountability for those responsible.

A      doctor named Mohammad Abu Rajab left a voice message: ``This      is a final distress call to the world. Save the lives of      these children and women and old men. Save them. Nobody is      left. You might not hear our voice after this.'' A      photographer named Ameen Al-Halabi wrote on Facebook: ``I am      waiting to die or be captured by the Assad regime. Pray for      me and always remember us.'' A teacher named Abdulkafi Al-     Hamdo said: ``I can tweet now but I might not do it forever.      Please save my daughter's life and others.

It is extremely hard to get information, of course, out of      the small area still held by the opposition. You will hear      this as an alibi as a way of papering over what video      testimony, phone calls, and others are bringing us live. You      will hear this invoked--that it is hard to verify. It is      deliberate. The Assad regime and Russia backed by Iran using      militia on the ground have done everything they can to cut      off the city.

There are no first responders or      equipment left to dig them out, and no doctors left to treat      them. Bodies lying in the streets of eastern Aleppo, but no      one dares collect them, for fear of getting bombed or shot to      death in the process. Up to a hundred children are reportedly      trapped right now, in a building under heavy fire.      Clearly--young children--they must be terrorists      because everybody being executed, everybody being barrel      bombed, everybody who's been chlorine attacked, you're going      to be told they are all terrorists--every last one of them,      even the infants.       The regime of Bashar Al-Assad, Russia, Iran, and their      affiliated militia are the ones responsible for what the UN      called ``a complete meltdown of humanity.'' And they are      showing no mercy:       No mercy despite their territorial conquests--even now, no      mercy. In the last 24 hours alone, pro-Assad forces      reportedly killed at least 82 civilians, including 11 women      and 13 children.       These forces are reportedly entering homes and executing      civilians on the spot, as we have heard. And according to the      Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, foreign      militias like Iraqi Harakat Al-Nujaba organization are      involved in these killings. Where civilians are able to run      the gauntlet and make it across the frontlines, Syrian      intelligence agencies are pulling people aside and sending      them away, perhaps to be gang-pressed to the front lines,      likely to the same prisons where we know the Assad regime      tortures and executes those in its custody.       In light of these reports, we join others, especially the      Secretary-General, in one of his final appeals, reiterating      our call to the Assad regime and Russia to stop their assault      on Aleppo, to protect civilians. We call on Russia and Assad      to allow impartial, international observers into the city to      oversee the safe evacuation of the people who wish to leave,      but who justifiably fear that if they try, they will be shot      in the street or carted off to one of Assad's gulags.       The Assad regime and Russia appear dead set on seizing      every last square inch of Aleppo by force, no matter how many      innocent bodies pile up in their wake. But we keep insisting      on answering the UN call for access, for safe and orderly      evacuation, because we are not willing to accept that      innocent men, women, and children can be butchered simply      because they happen to live in a conflict area. Our shared      humanity and security demands that certain rules of war hold,      the most basic. And it is up to each and every one of us here      to defend those rules.       To the Assad regime, Russia, and Iran--three Member States      behind the conquest of and carnage in Aleppo--you bear      responsibility for these atrocities. By rejecting UN-ICRC      evacuation efforts, you are signaling to those militia who      are massacring innocents to keep doing what they are doing.      Denying or obfuscating the facts--as you will do today--     saying up is down, black is white, will not absolve you. When      one day there is a full accounting of the horrors committed      in this assault of Aleppo--and that day will come, sooner or      later--you will not be able to say you did not know what was      happening. You will not be able to say you were not involved.      We all know what is happening. And we all know you are      involved.       Aleppo will join the ranks of those events in world history      that define modern evil, that stain our conscience decades      later. Halabja, Rwanda, Srebrenica, and, now, To the      Assad regime, Russia, and Iran, your forces and proxies are      carrying out these crimes. Your barrel bombs and mortars and      airstrikes have allowed the militia in Aleppo to encircle      tens of thousands of civilians in your ever-tightening noose.      It is your noose. Three Member States of the UN contributing      to a noose around civilians. It should shame you. Instead, by      all appearances, it is emboldening you. You are plotting your      next assault. Are you truly incapable of shame? Is there      literally nothing that can shame you? Is there no act of      barbarism against civilians, no execution of a child that      gets under your skin, that just creeps you out a little bit?      Is there nothing you will not lie about or justify?       To the members of this Council, and all Member States of      the United Nations: Know that the ghastly tactics we are      witnessing in Aleppo will not stop if the city falls. The      regime and its Russian allies will only be emboldened to      replicate their starve-and-surrender-and-slaughter tactics      elsewhere. This will be their model for attempting to retake      cities and towns across       It will not end with And it will not focus on      terrorists. It never has, and there is no evidence that it      will.       This is why it is so essential that each of us right here--     no matter how small a country you are, no matter what your      view of sovereignty, if you share our view that terrorism is      one of the singular causes on earth worth fighting, it      doesn't matter--you have a responsibility to denounce these      atrocities. We have just heard the Secretary-General state it      plainly. You have to tell those responsible that they must      stop. This isn't the time for more equivocation, for self-     censoring, for avoiding naming names, for diplomatic niceties      of the kind that are so well-practiced here on the      Say who is responsible. Appeal to Moscow, to Damascus, to      Tehran, that they have to stop. Use every channel you have--     public, private, bankshot, through someone who knows someone.      The lives of tens of thousands of Syrians still in eastern      Aleppo--between 30,000-60,000 people--and hundreds of      thousands more across the country who are besieged, depend on      it.       I thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1157-2.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 66, DISAPPROVING RULE",2017.0,14.0,February
1136,topic-id,1884,"Madam President, today I must vote to oppose the confirmation of Scott Pruitt as the President's nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, While I believe that the President enjoys some privilege of selecting administration officials, the views that Mr.Pruitt and I hold on a wide range of key environmental issues are completely irreconcilable. I was deeply disturbed by Mr.Pruitt's lack of specificity and his evasiveness during his hearing and in response to written questions.  While no one would expect Mr.Pruitt to detail the new Trump administration's policies on these complex issues, we do expect the nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency to share with us his own views on important matters, including whether there are any EPA regulations he supports, or whether he would fully recuse himself from making decisions in all legal cases in which he was an original party--but no. Instead, he testified that he had not conducted a comprehensive review of existing EPA regulations. With respect to recusals, he asserts that he would simply follow the recommendations of the EPA's ethics office. That is not good enough.  I am deeply disturbed by Mr.Pruitt's evasive responses. This does not bode well for his future interactions with Congress where he will certainly be required to appear before committees and provide testimony, briefing materials, and other information in a timely manner. Under oath before the Environment and Public Works Committee, he told the committee members, U.Senators, to go to the back of the line, to make records requests to his home State if they wanted information. This is information that Mr.Pruitt could and should have provided to the committee. As a result, information needed by the Senate to judge his fitness for this position has yet to be revealed.  Committee members were told 19 separate times to get the information they were requesting from his own office, the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, an office that has more than a 2-year backlog for such requests. That is not the spirit of openness and transparency we expect and must demand from witnesses, let alone from nominees who come before the U.How can the Senate adequately fulfill its responsibility of advice and consent if nominees will not cooperate? Mr.Pruitt has stonewalled the committee and the entire Senate on answers to basic questions about possible conflicts of interest. He has refused to provide relevant emails and other documents. This is unacceptable. It is also unacceptable to advance and approve this nominee without a clear and complete view of his record and his close relationships with the very companies he will be tasked with regulating.  With respect to the Agency that he has been nominated to lead, it is imperative that we not reverse or halt the tremendous progress that has been made in achieving strong, scientifically based environmental protection goals. The EPA itself was born out of an environmental crisis in this country, in the wake of elevated awareness of and concern about pollution. This came after our Nation watched in horror as the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, OH, burst into flames again as it was so saturated with sewage and industrial waste that it oozed rather than flowed. That pollution was a byproduct of unchecked pollution from industrial wastes.  Over its 46 years, the EPA has made enormous progress and become one of the world's most successful protectors of public health and the environment. Americans now expect clean air and clean water, where, before the EPA was created, we expected nothing more than burning rivers and polluted air. While cleaning up the environment, we have also grown jobs and strengthened our economy. However, we continue to face an environmental crisis of our own making with climate change, and EPA's mission to protect public health and the environment reminds us that the tasks of this Agency are essential to every single Americans care about having clean air to breath, safe drinking water, and swimmable and fishable rivers and streams. They want their food to be free of pesticides and their workplaces to be healthy and safe. They want their children to have a future that is free of the dangers of climate change.  Sadly, Mr.Pruitt refuses to accept the scientific community's overwhelming consensus that unchecked increases in greenhouse gas emissions will have catastrophic effects. The science is crystal clear that the impacts of climate change will increase in frequency and scale. Even the Department of Defense recognizes that climate change will impact the complexity of future missions, including defense support to civil authorities, while at the same time undermining the capacity of our domestic installations to support training activities.  Climate change cannot be dismissed as merely a political issue. We need to address the unfettered release of carbon and other greenhouse gases and have a strong resilience strategy to address the plight of future generations and the hazards already plaguing this one; yet we continue to have political claims thrown about that the EPA's work to address climate change and limit carbon emissions is to blame for the decline in the coal industry. At their base, these are more ``alternative facts.'' This was confirmed yet again[[Page S1369]]this week as the owners of the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant in Arizona, voted to close the facility at the end of 2019. It was not EPA regulations or the Clean Power Plan that were cited as the reason for the closure of the coal-fired plant. No, it was the fact that, in a market that is saturated by cheap natural gas prices, the plant was no longer economical to operate. Attempts by the President and this nominee to spread alternative facts and to misleadingly promise to prop up an industry, by blaming action on climate change, is not the way to move our country forward and stimulate innovation that will create good, new American jobs that cannot be shipped overseas.  For the benefit of the Senate record on this nominee, I would like to take this opportunity to share some of the messages that I have received from thousands of Vermonters over the past few weeks about this nominee. One Vermonter from Norwich, VT, a student studying sustainability and environmental management, said she is fearful of Mr.Pruitt's focus on eliminating and defunding any programs that could help to stop climate change. She went on to describe the importance of peer-reviewed scientific research on climate change and how Federal support for our leading academic institutions to complete this research is in our national interest as we monitor the Earth's vital signs.  I also heard from a constituent from Essex Junction, Vermont, who shared with me how he has seen firsthand at his technology company how the Federal promotion of research and development has directly promoted innovation and technological change. This innovation and these technical advances have led to new technologies that have radically changed many aspects of our lives and have transformed our economy, creating jobs, and invigorating our entrepreneurial spirit. He was concerned that Mr.Pruitt would seek to dismantle work that the EPA has done to find better ways to solve environmental problems, from research and technology to regulation, community programs, and external partnerships as they work to find creative ways to achieve results.  I also heard from Vermont farmers like one in Bristol, VT, who shared with me how her family farm has experienced the firsthand chaotic effects of climate change and has responded to the call to be more resilient. She voiced her willingness to cooperate with government regulations to protect our air, water, and soil and that we ``need the EPA to use science and enforcement to lead the charge.'' She went on to say that the head of the EPA should be working to ensure that our air is clean to breathe and our water is safe to drink, not to ensure that polluters get a free pass. I agree wholeheartedly with her.  From rural Hartland, I heard from one Vermonter who said that ``the health and wellbeing of Americans must be a priority--not the wealth of a few corporations and the individuals that benefit from that wealth. America must be a global leader when it comes to addressing climate change if all nations are to take appropriate measures.''  As Vermont's ski resorts have enjoyed over ample snow in the last week, I have heard from hundreds of snow sport enthusiasts who are deeply worried about Mr.Pruitt leading the They know that climate change is a threat to our planet and to our economy. In recent years, we have seen abnormally high temperatures that severely hurt our ski and tourism industries in Many ski areas saw business down 20 percent, and some saw a drop of as much as 40 percent. This does not just affect our ski areas and our mountains, but also our restaurants, our local hotels, contractors, and countless other businesses that are driven by the vitality of our ski industry. For the State of Vermont, the revenue from ski slopes is an important part of our economy, and we need an EPA Administrator ready to tackle the problems of climate change, not one whose primary goal is supporting business as usual for the worst polluters.  I agree with the thousands of Vermonters who have contacted me concerned about this nominee. I believe that Mr.Pruitt's nomination sends exactly the wrong signal to the country and to the world as we are combatting the global impacts and causes of climate change. His nomination represents a massive shift away from putting public health and the environment first, and towards ``Polluters `R' Us''--the industries that directly benefit from being given free rein to pollute. His past conduct suggests that he will do everything he can to support those polluters and put their profits ahead of the public good.  The decisions made by the Administrator of the EPA affect the air we breathe, our scenic rivers, our precious resources, the water that our children drink, and the rate at which the United States contributes to the rapidly changing global climate. This appointee's work will have a long-term global impact and a major impact on all of our children and grandchildren and on our shared heritage and our natural legacy as  In my years in the U.Senate, I have evaluated many nominees and I have supported nominations from both Republican and Democratic Presidents, despite my reservations on some views they held. I have also opposed some nominees because their records were so clearly contrary to the public interest. Rarely have I seen a nominee so totally unqualified and so profoundly a threat to our environment. The views Mr.Pruitt and I hold on protecting Americans' health and our environment and addressing climate change are far too conflicting to allow me to support his nomination.  The Senate will confirm Mr.Of this, there is no question. But then we will begin our duty to provide dogged oversight of his actions at the Public trust and confidence demand the highest level of accountability to ensure the stewardship of our federal funds, to safeguard the integrity of the EPA, to base decisions on rigorous, fact-based, peer-reviewed science, for the protection of both public health and our environment.  I worry that confirming Mr.Pruitt will turn the Environmental Protection Agency into the ``Polluters Protection Agency.'' I cannot support his confirmation.

1479,topic-id,1254,"Madam President, I have been concerned. As I read the press and talk with officials, I learn more about the troubling connections between the Russian Government and President Trump's campaign and administration.  We already knew--it is very, very factual--that Russian President Putin ordered a multifaceted campaign to undermine public faith in our election and to help President Trump win in That is something all of us as Americans should be concerned about. Whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent, when you have that kind of an attack on our democracy, it is a concern to all of us.  Reports indicate that Trump officials were in repeated contact with senior Russian intelligence officials during this time. This comes on the heels of the President's National Security Advisor having to resign after providing misleading details on conversations he had with the Russian Ambassador concerning U.sanctions. But there is a lot we still don't know, including the extent of the contacts, who directed them, whether people who at one point or another left the Trump campaign were involved, whether there was collusion, and, of course, the obvious question: What did the President know and when he did he know it?  The American people deserve to know the facts. They deserve a full and fair investigation that is free from any political influence. The White House has already demonstrated it is not going to respect the independence of this investigation. The fact that the White House Chief of Staff attempted to use the FBI--in violation of Justice Department policies--to suppress news reports about Russian contacts reveals why we really can't trust the White House to play by the rules. And, of course, the rules are very, very clear.  For these reasons, I am calling on Attorney General Sessions to step aside on this issue and to appoint a special counsel to conduct an independent investigation. That is not an attack on Attorney General I have known him for 30 years. I just want to make sure we do not have these continuing questions about what the President knew and when he knew it.  Even a cursory review of the Justice Department's recusal standards reveals that the Attorney General does not--indeed, cannot--have the independence necessary to assure wary Americans that this investigation will be driven by the facts, not by relationships. Certainly those who have served as prosecutors--Attorney General Sessions has; I have--know that there are times when the prosecutor has to step aside and let someone else do it just so that everybody can be confident in the investigation.  In fact, Justice Department regulations mandate that ``no employee shall participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with . . . [a]ny person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation.'' Of course, a ``political relationship'' is defined as ``a close identification with an elected official . . . arising from service as a principal adviser thereto.'' Prior to his confirmation, when we were holding the confirmation hearings on then-Senator Jeff Sessions, I asked him whether he met the standard. It is not really a close call. The rule perfectly describes the relationship between Attorney General Sessions and President But he brushed the question off, claiming that he was ``merely . . . a supporter of the President's during the campaign.''  Well, that is an obvious mischaracterization of the role he played as a top adviser to the Trump campaign. Attorney General--then-Senator--Sessions was widely recognized as a central figure in the campaign. He had his fingerprints all over the President's policies. In fact, one of the President's top advisers, Steve Bannon, even called him the President's ``clearinghouse for policy and philosophy.'' That is a pretty close connection. I could hardly think of anything closer. To suggest the Attorney General was just ``a supporter'' and that he did not have a ``political relationship'' with the Trump campaign, when you look at the Bannon comments, that is patently false.  If the Attorney General refuses to follow the Department's recusal standard--now as the head of the Department, well, then, I would hope he would follow his own recusal standards. Last year, just days before the election, then-Senator Sessions and other Trump campaign surrogates wrote an op-ed. He criticized then-Attorney General Lynch for not recusing herself from matters involving Secretary The basis of his complaint was a ``39-minute conversation''--to use his words--that Attorney General Lynch had with former President Bill Clinton in Phoenix, I would hope he would set the same standard for himself that he sets for others because it is kind of hard to talk about a half-hour conversation and say that requires recusal when it comes to the Clintons, but a year's worth of vigorously campaigning with and vigorously advising does not when it comes to the Trump campaign. A year working on the Trump campaign doesn't count, but 39 minutes talking to former President Clinton does? Come on. If that is the standard for recusal in one case--I won't do the math on how many times 39 minutes goes into a year, but I would say, using Jeff Sessions' own standards, he has far, far, far more reason to recuse himself in this matter.  During the 20 years I have worked with him, Jeff Sessions has often spoken of his commitment to the rule of law. I know he feels strongly about[[Page S1432]]that, just as I do. As Senators, every one of us should. Certainly every one of us who has had the privilege to be a prosecutor should have a commitment to the rule of law. Well, Attorney General Sessions' commitment is now being tested.  Whether we apply the Justice Department's recusal standard, which is very, very clear, or use the Jeff Sessions' 39-minute recusal standard, it is clear that Attorney General Sessions must step aside. In fact, nothing less than the integrity of our democracy is at stake with this investigation. And I do not say that lightly. Nothing less than the integrity of our democracy is at stake with this investigation. What did everybody know? When did they know it?  It is essential that the investigation be led by someone who--in both appearance and in reality--is impartial and removed from politics. That does not describe someone who was in the trenches of a political campaign with the subjects of the investigation while they were allegedly engaged in the activity under investigation, or somebody who has been described by Steve Bannon as a ``clearinghouse for policy and philosophy'' for President  For the good of the country, for the good of all of us--Republicans, Democrats, Independents--the Attorney General really has just one thing to do: Appoint a special counsel and let the public have the answers. What did everybody know? When did they know it? It is pretty simple. The people of Vermont, and I suspect throughout the country, would like to have those answers that go to the bedrock of our democracy.  In my 42 years here, I have never seen anything that has concerned me so much as another country that does not have the best interests of the United States at heart trying to interfere in our election, another country trying to determine what the United States does. This is a country that does not have the United States' best interests at heart but a country that wants to manipulate the United This U.Senator, for the time I have in office, will continue to speak out against it.

The Judiciary Committee and the whole Senate has benefited from his knowledge.  What the leader of Poland said to the distinguished Senator is a very chilling thing, Madam He knows from his own family ancestors how bad an area can be if it is under the domination of something like the then-Soviet Union and now He also knows from his own experience as an American how important it is that we have the freedoms we have.

And we just sit there, and it is so easy for us who grew up in an era in which we believe in our democracy and we believe in our voices being heard, where sometimes we win elections and sometimes we lose them, but we believe in the fairness of it.

1503,topic-id,606,"Mr.President, today Mr.Ross joins the growing list of billionaires appointed by the Trump administration. It is not their wealth that concerns me, but their past conflicts with the agencies they are promoted to lead and support, providing guidance for policy and for administration of the laws. It is for this reason I cannot support Mr.Ross today.  Every American has a stake in the strength of our economy. We rely on the Department of Commerce to facilitate trade, investment, and innovation in a direction that ensures long-term benefits for Today while the wealthiest among us continue to profit, middle class families are working long hours to pay their bills and put food on their tables. The cost of living is outstripping their family budgets, and we must get ahead of this curve.  Mr.Ross has a background of buying fledging companies, and while he might turn around the profit margins of those companies, it is at the cost of American jobs. He has been called fair and practical, but has also committed his career in business by expanding in low-cost countries like Mexico and The economic policies of this country cannot be built on representing the interests of rich investors, but must also be creative in spurring job growth in American communities where industry has disappeared. We can shape our global trade policy in ways that benefit the United States, without having to do so under the assumption that the United States needs to operate in isolation in order to realize economic success. We can build industry at home, while partnering abroad in trade for our products. But it will take the commitment of the next Secretary to focus on our human capital as innovators and not as mere cost considerations.  Although America's role in the global market is expanding, our closest trade partner remains across our northern border. Each year, we export hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods and services to Canada, making it our largest export market in the world. Vermont is an active contributor to this flow of commerce. Supporting initiatives that strengthen this partnership will benefit local businesses in Vermont and across the Mr.Ross wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, and while we can debate the merits of NAFTA, the talk of renegotiating this agreement without the partnership of Mexico and Canada has many Vermont businesses concerned about the implications for their future and for the Vermont jobs that depend on our export markets.  We live in a global economy, and I work with Vermont businesses every day who rely on importing goods and materials in order to successfully create a final products that are a combination of U.and foreign made. This is the reality for many businesses today. I do not criticize the decisions a businessowner makes for the quality of their product. But every large corporation makes a choice between cheaper overseas labor and materials or investing in the workforce here at home for greater gains in the future. That is a choice that Mr.Ross has made on several occasions for the benefit of profits not workers.  I have said it time and again, but America thrives when our middle class is strong. As Secretary, Mr.Ross will be expected to represent the interests of all I hope he takes this commitment seriously and works across party lines to create new industry and opportunity that take root in the very communities that suffer from lack of it.

348,topic-id,369,"Mr.Speaker, first, let me thank Congressman Davis for yielding and for his tireless advocacy on behalf of the most vulnerable everywhere.  I rise in strong opposition to H.42, which is really another baseless attack on the poor, on low-income individuals, and on the unemployed. Drug testing unemployed individuals is downright wrong.  Let me be clear. This resolution is another way for Republicans to stop[[Page H1205]]workers from claiming their right to unemployment benefits. It also is a scare tactic that flies in the face of facts.  First, there is no evidence that people who receive public assistance use drugs any more frequently than those in the general population. Unemployment compensation, mind you, is not public assistance.  By unnecessarily drug testing jobless workers, we are throwing them out in the cold when they are simply trying to get back on their feet.  Mr.Speaker, workers receive unemployment benefits because they worked hard, they played by the rules, and they were laid off through no fault of their own.  More importantly, working people have earned their right to apply for these benefits. They pay into the program. Their constitutional rights should not be violated.  I also know that people want to work. People don't want to be on unemployment insurance. They want to provide for themselves and their families.  Let me remind you, there is an opioid and heroin drug epidemic in this country, and it not only affects Democrats, this drug crisis is affecting Republicans, Independents--everyone. Yet, once again, you are throwing them out in the cold.  Instead of passing this appalling resolution--and this resolution is appalling--we should be expanding job training, unemployment benefits for all, and provide resources for drug treatment. It is hard to believe that you want to punish people. That is what this resolution really does. It punishes people for working. That is really a shame and disgrace.  So I strongly oppose this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I also urge you to encourage people to work, to provide those job training resources and drug abuse resources for our mental health centers, for our drug counseling centers, and for everyone who needs treatment rather than drug testing to keep them from getting a job.

639,topic-id,1178,"Mr.Speaker, every year when we celebrate and reflect on Black History Month, we learn the stories of some of America's greatest scientists, actors, writers, entertainers, scholars, workers, and ordinary people who made major contributions to this great country.  As a member of the Military Construction, Veteran Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, I want to share the unsung stories of the valiant Black men and women who served their country dutifully during World War II even in the face of adversity.  We know about the brave Tuskegee Airmen--Red Tails--who flew fighter and bomber planes during World War II, but many do not know that the Red Tails were only a few of the nearly 1 million African Americans who served during the war. These courageous men and women fought bravely to protect the democratic ideals of freedom and equality.  Sadly, the country they served did not live up to those ideals. When they returned from victory in Europe and the Pacific, many did not receive a hero's welcome because of the color of their skin.  My dad, the late Lieutenant Colonel Garvin Tutt, was one of those heroes. He served in the 92nd Battalion in Italy supporting the Normandy invasion, was in World War II, the Korean war, and served in the Army for 25 years.  Only recently have the contributions of African-American men and women during World War II been recognized as our country has attempted to acknowledge its sad and dark past. That is why I am taking time on the floor today to honor the 138 African-American men and women buried in Normandy American Cemetery and the 5 men who remain missing. It is my hope that, by sharing these stories today and entering their names into the Record, more people will come to appreciate the sacrifices of these brave men and women who served this country with distinction during World War  Now, most people know that on June 6, 1944, approximately 2,000 soldiers landed on the beaches of Normandy for what would be a major turning point in the war, but far fewer know that the all-Black 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion served with distinction during the D-day invasions. The 320th was the only Black unit to take part on D-day and the only balloon battalion dedicated to protecting troops from intense German aircraft attacks on Omaha and Utah beaches. This was unique because Black units were usually kept from combat and fulfilled essential support services instead.  As part of their mission to protect Allied troops, the men of the 320th implemented innovative ideas to ease transportation to shore of barrage balloons that weighed half a ton. In addition to defending American soldiers during D-day invasions, the battalion also secured its own successful offensive strikes. The battalion's ingenuity and service was later recognized as an important element of the air defense team by Dwight Eisenhower, who was Supreme Allied Commander General at the time.  Sadly, no sacrifice comes without the loss of human life. During the D-day invasion, the 320th suffered two casualties. Corporal Brooks Stith and Corporal Henry Harris from the 320th are both buried at the Normandy American Each of these men was decorated with the Purple Heart, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal for their valiant service. There is James McLean of the 320th, who died on July 16, 1944. He was also buried at the cemetery.  African Americans who were buried at the cemetery, the men from the 320th, were buried with their White peers. Even though units were segregated until President Harry Truman changed official Department of Defense policies in 1948, Black and White soldiers who died in Normandy were buried together. At the Normandy American Cemetery, 135 African-American men and 3 African-American women were laid to rest from 1944 to 1945.  Mr.Speaker, there are five Black men who remain missing in action while posted in They are honored on the Walls of the Missing at Normandy with more than 1,700 others.  While women were not allowed in combat during World War II, three Black women from the 6888th Postal Directory Battalion of the Women's Army Corps are also buried at the cemetery. They were killed during an accident with a jeep.  Now, this was an all-women, all-Black unit that helped process mail in Europe during World War They were the first Black battalion deployed after First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and civil rights leader Mary McLeod Bethune advocated for Black women to join the Women's Army Corps, the WAC, for nearly a year and a half. The women received basic training and were trained in jujitsu because they were not allowed to carry firearms. They successfully helped clear massive mail backlogs in various cities across  While the women of the 6888th were celebrated for their work in Europe, some historians speculate that inspectors would sometimes give unsatisfactory reviews because of their prejudices.  Unit commander Major Charity Adams was court-martialed once for pushing back when a general threatened to send a ``white first lieutenant'' to show her how to command her unit.  We are indebted to these women for their exemplary work processing mail efficiently to[[Page H1255]]keep up the morale of our troops during But more importantly, we owe them the respect they never received.  Mr.Speaker, these men and women lost their lives too soon for a country that hasn't done a great job of remembering their bravery and their sacrifices.  An analysis conducted by the Army showed that the average age of African American service members buried at the NAC is 27 years--the prime age when a young person is starting their life.  That is why it is so important for us to remember and tell their stories during Black History  As Black History Month continues, I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in honoring their memories by also speaking on the Floor about other all-Black battalions who fought during  As the daughter of a WWII and Korean Veteran, I am very honored to be on the Military-Veterans Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure our veterans receive the care and recognition they deserve.  Let me close by thanking our Military-Veterans Chair, Congressman Charlie Dent and then Ranking Member Sanford Bishop and then full Committee Chair Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey, for their support in the Appropriations Committee and the commission for helping bring these great heroes and sheros to the attention of the American people and by properly recognizing their sacrifices and their legacies.  Hopefully this effort will help us locate their descendants and families to and thank them and honor them as part of yes--Black History but of course this is American History that all Americans should recognize and learn from.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the chair of our subcommittee, Mr.Dent, Ranking Member Lowey, Mr.Bishop, and you, Mr.Rogers, for your support in the Appropriations Committee and for the American Battle Monuments Commission's very dedicated work in helping us bring these great heroes and sheroes to the attention of the American people by properly recognizing their sacrifices and their legacies.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1251-3.txt,1501,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,16.0,February
724,topic-id,214,"Madam Speaker, let me thank Congresswoman DeGette for her tireless leadership in fighting for women's health, for healthy families in general, and for our children.  I rise in strong opposition to H.43. It is no surprise that, once again, congressional Republicans are trying to undermine women's access to health care and basic family planning services.

It would also deny thousands of families from choosing their provider of choice--and sometimes the only accessible provider--under title  Not only is this resolution antiwoman, it is also counterproductive. We know that for every dollar spent on title X family planning, we save more than $7 on Medicaid-related costs. But my Republican colleagues are so determined to take family planning options away from low-income women that they are prepared to put ideological perspectives above public health.  As a member of the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I, unfortunately, see these attacks on women's health all too well.

988,topic-id,988,"Mr.President, I am proud to stand today and support Scott Pruitt, President Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection  I can think of no one who is better suited or more fully qualified to lead this Agency and to advance within it the reforms it so desperately needs. I look forward to voting to confirm Mr.Pruitt as EPA Administrator, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.  In many ways, the EPA epitomizes the broken status quo in Washington--a status quo that is increasingly and rightfully viewed with suspicion and a certain amount of contempt by the American people. That broken and discredited status quo has been described in various ways: out of touch, arbitrary, inflexible, unreasonable, heavyhanded, unaccountable. These words could apply to any number of institutions or offices here in Washington, DC, but they are the hallmarks of the rule-writing departments that make up our Federal bureaucracy.  Technically, these bureaucratic agencies are creatures of the executive branch--creatures that exist to assist the President in fulfilling his constitutional duty to take care that the laws, written by the legislative branch, are to be faithfully executed. But over the past several decades, they have been recast as the Federal Government's center of gravity, both writing and enforcing and, in many cases, even interpreting, the vast majority of laws governing America's society and America's economy.  Elevating the unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy to the driver's seat of the Federal Government--to the driver's seat, specifically, of Federal policymaking--is mostly the work of Members of Congress, of both Chambers and of both political parties, who understand that the best way to avoid being blamed by voters for unpopular laws is not to make them--at least not to make them completely--but rather to empower unelected bureaucrats to make the laws for them. But the regulatory agencies themselves sometimes deserve some of the blame as well.  Congress is guilty of writing laws that are couched in vague terms, centered around gauzy goals, instead of strictly defined as understandable rules. But Federal regulators are guilty of interpreting--and repeatedly reinterpreting--those laws in order to accommodate their ever-expanding conception of their own power, of their own authority to work their own will on the American people.  For instance, in the years since Congress passed the Clean Air Act amendments in 1977, Federal bureaucrats have used the law to enact more than 13,500 pages of regulations, which works out to roughly 30 pages of regulations for every 1 page of underlying legislative text.  The fundamental problem with this expansion and centralization of regulatory authority is the tendency of[[Page S1262]]Washington, DC, bureaucrats to be ignorant of--and often very indifferent to--the interests of the people who live in the various communities who are affected by the rules they make and the rules they also enforce.  This isn't a knock on the individual men and women who work within the Federal bureaucracy, most of whom are well-educated, well-intentioned, and highly specialized. But there is no doubt that a regulator in Washington, DC, knows a whole lot less about a melon farm in Emery County, UT, and cares a lot less about the fate of the people who work at that melon farm in Emery County, UT, than what the regulators say in Salt Lake  The Environmental Protection Agency, in particular, is notorious for its top-down, Washington-knows-best approach to regulation, which often runs roughshod over the immense diversity of local circumstances in our large country.  Too often, the EPA treats States and State regulators not as partners but as adversaries. It treats the States themselves not as laboratories of republican democracy but, rather, as lab rats to be tested upon for their own amusement and for the exertion of their own political power.  Scott Pruitt understands this well because he has seen it firsthand as attorney general of Mr.Pruitt has spent many years being ignored and pushed around by Washington, an experience that has taught him the need for the EPA to work with and not condescend to the  In his Senate confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt explained why improving the relationship between the EPA and State-level regulators is the best way to protect our environment and uphold the separation of powers that is the cornerstone of our constitutional system. He said: ``Cooperative Federalism is at the heart of many of the environmental statutes that involve the Environmental Protection Agency.''  The reason for that is that it is the States that many times have the resources, the expertise, and an understanding of the unique challenges of protecting our environment and improving our water and our air. We need a true partnership between the EPA in performing its roll, along with the States in performing theirs. If we have that partnership, as opposed to punishment, as opposed to the uncertainty and duress that we currently see in the marketplace, I think we will have better air and better water quality as a result.  For many Americans--and certainly for many of my fellow Utahns--the EPA is pejorative. It is synonymous with an out-of-touch and out-of-control government.  This is a shame. Americans want--and Americans certainly deserve--clean air and clean water. The EPA has the potential to help them achieve these goals, but only if the EPA itself returns to its core mission and works well, works wisely to accomplish that mission, and works within our constitutional system.  That is why I am so pleased that Scott Pruitt is on his way to lead the The Agency exists to protect the American people, not advance the narrow agenda of some special interests while punishing others.  I am confident that Mr.Pruitt is the right man for the job and that he will remain independent while correcting the troubling course that the EPA has taken in recent decades.

346,topic-id,513,"Mr.Speaker, at the onset of the Great Recession, our unemployment insurance system was completely inadequate. Democrats took the lead, against increasing Republican opposition, to improve the system and to provide unemployment benefits to Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The result was an emergency Federal unemployment compensation program which helped more than 24 million people.  Research from a broad array of experts shows these Federal UI benefits, in combination with State-provided benefits, saved more than 2 million jobs, prevented 1.4 million home foreclosures, and kept an estimated 5 million Americans out of poverty. In short, a strong unemployment insurance system helped prevent the Great Recession from turning into another Great  Today, our unemployment insurance system is again inadequate and totally unprepared to respond to a future recession; and once again, rather than stepping up with solutions, Republicans' answer to working people is a cold shoulder. Instead of responding to the deterioration of our unemployment insurance system, Republicans today want to shame and blame Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, while also violating their constitutional rights.  Here are the real problems this legislation completely ignores:  Number one, only one out of every four jobless Americans now receives unemployment benefits, near a record all-time low.  Two, eight States have cut back on the maximum number of weeks of benefits available for unemployed workers, including my home State of  Three, the value of UI benefits has declined over time, with 30 States now having maximum UI benefits that are less than half of the State's average weekly wage.  Four, the triggers for the federally funded Extended Benefits program, EB, are extremely out of date, so they do not turn on when unemployment begins to rise significantly.  Five, our Nation's UI system is underfunded, with only 18 States' funds reaching a minimum level of adequate solvency, according to a 2016 DOL report.  Six, the Federal UI trust funds, which support extended benefits during downturns in the economy, have a deficit of over $8 billion, hurt by the majority's decision to allow part of the revenue stream to those funds to expire in 2011.  Seven, our spending on workforce development as a percentage of GDP is now only one-seventh of its 1979 peak; and since 2010, Republicans in Congress have cut workforce education programs by $400 million. So we are doing less to help the unemployed while they look for work and less to help them prepare for a new job.  Today's bill ignores these problems completely and, instead, attempts to demean those needing help. In discouraging access to unemployment benefits, it reminds me of a massive problem we have uncovered in Michigan that involved at least 20,000--and perhaps many more--UI claimants being wrongly accused of fraud and ordered to pay huge penalties.  We should be focusing today on ensuring our UI system is ready for the great challenge, not to mention helping Americans who are seeking work right now.

I think, in some cases, we have drifted from that.  I do want to talk about the blue-collar economy and what is happening to people who work in the building trades and work as truck drivers and nurses and people who are really the backbone of this country.  As Brendan mentioned, I was an ironworker for about 20 years. I know what it is when you are trying to work from paycheck to paycheck, strapping on a pair of work boots every single day.  I also want to focus tonight on one part of Mr.Trump's executive orders and policies that have really hurt people in our demographic: regular working people. I want to speak specifically about veterans.  As most people heard, President Trump, when he came into office, initiated what was called a Federal worker hiring freeze, stopping any workers from going to work for the Federal I just want to remind people out there that about 30 percent of those workers are veterans. So 30 percent of the people who go to work for the Federal Government are veterans. By putting a freeze on Federal workers, you are blocking almost one-third of workers who are veterans who would be trying to go to work.  The Federal Government is expansive. That includes workers at the VA; it includes workers at the FAA; it includes workers at the Defense Department, the State Department; on and on and on. So this is really freezing out veterans from going to work.  I had a young veteran in my office the other day who had some skills in radiology. He learned that through his military service in the Navy, but also when he got out, with the GI bill, and trying to go to work at the I had to explain to him that President Trump, when he came into office, put a hiring freeze on, and that we were going to have to try to figure out another way to put him to work.  Well, that case is playing out over 50 States, and thousands--probably tens of thousands right now--of veterans are being denied the opportunity to go to work for the Federal Many of them have skills that are necessary.  We have people retiring and leaving Federal employment on a daily basis. We have nurses that are retiring at the VA and folks that work for the EPA are leaving at the end of their working lives. They are retiring. Yet, we are blocking these veterans from filling those positions because of the President's hiring freeze.  Seeing that, I actually drafted a bill that I am happy to share. It is H.1001. It will basically create an exception. It will keep the President's freeze in place, except for veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, veterans who have served in previous conflicts. Anyone who has put on this country's uniform as a veteran would be exempt from the hiring freeze so that we can do the right thing.  Each and every one of these young men and women--and there are a lot of women--I have been to Iraq 17 times now; Afghanistan, about 9 times; and I am amazed at the number of young women who serve our country in uniform.  I already have, including my colleagues here, 23 Democrats who have signed on. I would love to get some of my Republican friends on this bill. This should not be a partisan issue, trying to put veterans to work. I am sure we have got some good Democrats and Republicans out there that agree on this, and this should be a bipartisan issue. We can stop the--let's be hopeful it was unintended consequences of the hiring freeze. We can stop this by coming together. Sign onto H.1001.  Again, I thank my colleagues for their advocacy on behalf of workers.

43,topic-id,152,"Mr.Speaker, at the 11th hour, the Obama administration's Labor Department issued a rule that stonewalled bipartisan changes to the unemployment insurance program. These changes were made so that tax dollars would be used in a more efficient and more effective manner.  It has been 5 years since Congress passed legislation giving the States the discretion on drug-testing policy for unemployment applicants. Using delay tactics, the previous administration prevented that law from ever being implemented as designed.  This kind of executive overreach impedes the ability of States to ensure that the unemployment insurance program accomplishes its intended purpose, and that is to promote reemployment.  In Texas, we take the job of fiscal responsibility very seriously. This week, Congress is responding to that overreach by the previous administration. We hope that Congress will take that responsibility very seriously.

232,topic-id,812,"Mr.President, it is Valentine's Day, and Senate Republicans and President Trump want to deliver a love letter to their sweetheart, the National Rifle To the Republicans and President Trump, nothing says ``I love you'' like ``let's weaken background checks on gun sales'' because that is exactly the issue before us today.  Today, Republicans in Congress and President Trump want to gut a commonsense safety measure that would help keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. After the tragedy in Newtown, CT, the Obama administration undertook a comprehensive review of Federal law to identify ``potentially dangerous individuals'' who should not be trusted with firearms.  The Social Security Administration was required to identify and report to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System those people who received Social Security benefits due to severe mental impairment and who require a fiduciary representative to manage those benefits.  That is a sensible policy. If you can't manage your disability benefits because of a mental impairment, you probably shouldn't be trying to manage a gun. Indeed, current law prohibits individuals from purchasing a firearm if a court, a board, a commission, or other lawful authority has determined that a mental health issue makes them a danger to themselves or to others or that they lack the mental capacity to contract or manage their own affairs.  The purpose of the rule is, simply, to include in the Federal background check system information from the Social Security Administration that it already has about beneficiaries whom current law already prohibits from possessing a firearm. Even this fair, reasonable, and commonsense limitation on gun purchasing is too much for the NRA and its Republican congressional allies. So they have turned, this afternoon, to the Congressional Review Act to roll back this rule. By doing so, they would block the Social Security Administration from issuing a similar rule on this subject in the future. This is shortsighted on the one hand and very dangerous on the other for a long, long time in our country because it is these loopholes in the background check system that have already allowed people to obtain guns, despite being judged a danger to themselves or to others, especially family members.  Loopholes in the system allowed the Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, and Newtown shooters to obtain guns. We need to close loopholes like the ones that allow people who are mentally impaired from buying guns. Repealing this rule only keeps the loophole open.  Recent polls show that 92 percent of Americans support background checks for all gun buyers--including 87 percent of Republicans in our country support background checks on who is, in fact, purchasing a gun in our country--but not the National Rifle The National Rifle Association sent an action alert to its membership on this current attempt to repeal the background check rule stating: ``The first pro-gun legislative act of the Trump era and Congress is on the verge of success, but it needs your help to get it over the line.'' That is all you need to know.  So on this Valentine's Day, the U.Senate should show some real love and compassion. Let us open our hearts to the American people who overwhelmingly are demanding commonsense gun control efforts like the one this rule puts in place. Let us defeat this ill-advised effort to roll back this rule which keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.  This is the job of the This is the carnage we see in It is the indiscriminate issuing of licenses for guns to people who have not gone through the background checks that ensure they are qualified for the handling of a weapon within our society. Everyone else can get the weapon. Everyone else who goes through the check gets the weapon but not people who should not have them.  So this is a big moment here. It, unfortunately, gives an insight into what the Republican agenda is going to be this year. It is a radical agenda. It is an agenda which says to the National Rifle Association: We are going to pass your agenda, no matter how radical, out here on the floor of the What the American people are saying is they want the NRA to stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American politics. That is what they want it to say, especially with the polling so overwhelmingly bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans, in terms of commonsense[[Page S1153]]background checks that are in the law to protect innocent families in our country.  All I can say is this isn't anything that is radical, this regulation. It is something that is common sense. It is something that protects American families, and I urge strongly that the U.Senate reject the removal of this regulation from the statutes of our country.  Mr.President, I yield back the remainder of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1149-2.txt,735,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,14.0,February
564,topic-id,3519,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Missouri, and the Senate, for giving me this opportunity to speak. I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney to be Director of the Office of Management and  Congressman Mulvaney represents the latest of President Trump's broken promises to the American people. In this case, it is President Trump's campaign promise to protect Social Security, and Congressman Mulvaney is the man who will lead the charge. The Office of Management and Budget, OMB, as it is called, is like that group of scientists in the movie ``Apollo 13'' who have to figure out how to bring the spacecraft home with only a few items found in a couple of boxes. In the movie, they describe it as fitting a square peg in a round hole. In government, we call it the Federal budget.  The crucial role of OMB and the development of the Federal budget means that the Director often has the final word on the priorities of our Federal agencies. The Director must be someone who will approach the enormity of the Federal Government in a thoughtful and deliberative manner. They must be able to consider how the budget will impact the everyday lives of all Representative Mulvaney's support for reckless, across-the-board cuts demonstrates that he is not up to this challenge.  Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that he would make no cuts to the Social Security safety net. That means no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Congressman Mulvaney's nomination shows that, despite what candidate Trump may have said, President Trump intends to do just the opposite. This is not what millions of people voted for. Mick Mulvaney's nomination has Americans across the country fearful for their futures, and they have every right to be scared.  Congressman Mulvaney represents an immediate threat to Social He represents a threat to the 1.2 million seniors in Massachusetts who currently rely on Social He represents a threat to the millions more who expect the program to be[[Page S1185]]there when they retire in coming years.  Mick Mulvaney has attempted to declare Social Security unconstitutional and has referred to the program as a Ponzi scheme. Well, Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme. Social Security is not a handout. Social Security is a promise we make to America's seniors after decades of hard work. It is the commitment we made to those who built this Nation, fought in wars, and provided for their families. Seniors pay into the system throughout their working lives, and they expect it to be there for them when they retire. We need to keep that promise.  Social Security is not just a line in the budget. It is a lifeline for millions of  In Massachusetts, the program keeps 295,000 people above the poverty line. Across the country, more than 15 million elderly Americans are able to live out their lives and not be driven into poverty because they have a Social Security check. That is what it does for 15 million Seniors will have nowhere to turn if President Trump and Representative Mulvaney have their way and Social Security ceases to exist. Congressman Mulvaney has repeatedly suggested raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 years old. Let me repeat that. Mick Mulvaney wants grandma and grandpa to wait until they are 70 years old--that is 4 years older than the current retirement age--before they can call upon the benefits they deserve.  Not only does Mick Mulvaney want to make it so Americans have to work longer, he wants them to receive less when they finally do retire. At his Budget Committee hearing, Mick Mulvaney said that he himself was willing to be subject to these new rules, since they might require him to work a couple of extra months before retirement and require his children to work until they are 70.  Nothing could be more out of touch with working-class, blue-collar workers across our country. I have no doubt that Mick Mulvaney would be able to work a few extra years in his current role as a Congressman or Director of OMB or a great job that he would get after those responsibilities, but what about millions of construction workers, carpenters, waitresses, gardeners, busdrivers, and others with physically demanding jobs? My father, a milkman--how many years can you work being a milkman? You have to go until you are 70 to receive a Social Security benefit in this country in the future? That is the challenge we have. We ask milkmen, we ask 69-year-old construction workers to lay cement in blistering summer heat because Social Security is no longer there when it is promised. Do we expect a 68-year-old window washer to climb the scaffolding every day when they cannot afford to retire without their Social Security benefits? We should not balance the budget on their backs. That is just plain wrong.  Raising the Social Security retirement age is just one of many of President Trump's broken promises. He also wants to cut Medicare and the health care of millions of Congressman Mulvaney looks ready to do the President's bidding as well.  Congressman Mulvaney has said we need to end Medicare as we know it and supported House Speaker Paul Ryan's destructive ideas to turn Medicare into a voucher program. Congressman Mulvaney went even further saying that those efforts did not go far enough. Those kinds of cuts to Medicare would be nothing short of a disaster for the 55 million Americans enrolled in the program, including the more than 1 million individuals in Massachusetts who rely on Medicare for their health care needs.  Seniors deserve an OMB Director who will protect their health care, not put it on the chopping block. We know Congressman Mulvaney is deeply committed to these misguided ideas because we have seen how far he is willing to go to support them. He was one of the few key cheerleaders of the Republican government shutdown in 2013. He was willing to put millions of American families, businesses, and services at risk in order to defund the Affordable Care  That shutdown cost the United States more than $24 billion. At that time, Congressman Mulvaney said it was good policy. He said it was all worth it in order to prove a point. That simply is irresponsible. That kind of recklessness has no place in the Office of Management and Congressman Mulvaney also does not believe in raising the debt limit.  Back in 2011, he put the economy at risk when Republicans held our debt limit hostage. He put the full faith and credit of the United States in danger by his willingness to allow the Treasury to default. That would have wreaked havoc on the financial markets and could have destabilized our entire economy, but Congressman Mulvaney dismissed these concerns and called the potential breach of the debt limit a fabricated crisis. Nothing could be more fiscally irresponsible and further from the truth.  Congressman Mulvaney is not the type of leadership Americans expect in their government, and he is not the type of leadership needed to direct the Office of Management and Strong leadership is especially crucial at the Office of Management and Budget, where responsible oversight of the regulatory process is a requirement of the Director's job. The individual in charge must be willing to make fair determinations based on facts and evidence.  Congressman Mulvaney's record gives me no confidence that he will meet this standard. Congressman Mulvaney also dismisses accepted science and rejects established facts. He has stated global warming is based on questionable science and has outright dismissed the threat that climate change imposes on the planet. OMB oversees agencies' use of the social cost of carbon, the Federal metric that assigns a dollar value for future damages to each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. We need an OMB Director who accepts the consequences of climate change because it will be the most vulnerable in our society who will pay the highest price if we ignore climate science and the danger it poses, not only to our own country but to the rest of the planet.  Our country faces serious challenges that require the careful and nonpartisan allocation of resources. We need a Director of the Office of Management and Budget who will hear the concerns of all Americans, not promote dangerous fiscal ideologies. Congressman Mulvaney has indicated that he will approach our budget with an ax, and it will be our seniors who will be first on the chopping block. I do not believe he is qualified to lead the Office of Management and  I do so remembering 1981 and 1982. Ronald Reagan arrived, and Ronald Reagan had a very simple plan for He was going to do three things fundamentally; 1, massive tax cuts for the wealthiest and biggest corporations in America; 2, simultaneously increasing defense spending massively; 3, to simultaneously pledge that he was going to balance the budget while unleashing massive economic growth in our country.  What he did then was to put together a team that had a remarkable ability to harness voluminous amounts of information to defend that knowingly erroneous premise. You cannot say you are heading toward balancing the budget if you are simultaneously saying: I am going to give massive tax breaks to those who need them the least and massive defense increases, which are going to further lead to Federal expenditures, because then you have to turn and you have to cut programs. You have to cut You have to cut Social You have to cut the You have to cut Head You have to cut food stamps. You have to cut programs for the poorest. You have to cut all of those investments in science in the future. You have to cut and cut and cut.  That really was not the goal because ultimately Ronald Reagan just retreated from the cuts because the pressure came from across America, but he had accomplished his principal goal, which was the massive defense increases and the tax cuts for the wealthy because that was the real agenda all along.  So there is a great book, ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed,'' by David He was the head of OMB for Ronald Reagan back in the early 1980s. He wrote a book in 1986 about his experiences with this failed economic philosophy. It is a blistering, scalding indictment of what they tried to do in 1981[[Page S1186]]and 1982. He wrote this as a warning to the future, about why we should not try to repeat what Reagan tried to do in 1981 and 1982.  What he talks about in the book is this. The same kind of made-up numbers to put a Panglossian--rose-colored glasses--the most optimistic projection on what would happen to our economy if we had these massive tax cuts and increases in defense spending, while pretending that we were going to do all of these other things, which actually never did occur.  So he said, because the numbers did not add up, they had to engage in a lot of fiscal chicanery. What he did was he constructed two little separate categories. 1, he called it the magic asterisk. The magic asterisk was this attempt to avoid ever specifically having to itemize all of the budget cuts that would cause a revolution in America because they knew they could not put that list out.  So they called it a magic asterisk--cuts to be named later, programs to be cut later. We all know the names of those programs--Medicare, Medicaid, education, Environmental Protection Agency, Head Start, all the way down the line--but we will just hide the ball on that.  Secondly, he constructed another idea, he said, which was also fraudulent, which was called ``rosy scenario.'' What they would do is, they would put together a group of economists who would then, using completely bogus projections for the future, project massive economic growth. That is what Donald Trump talks about now: Oh, we will see growth that you have never seen before in the history of mankind--rosy scenario.  There is no economic data to back it up, but that is just how much Trump is trying to model himself after this attempt in 1981 and 1982 to sell the exact same bill of goods, which collapsed, by the way. They collapsed like a house of cards economically because it did not add up. You cannot have a magic asterisk for all of these cuts that are never going to happen because ultimately the Democrats are going to back down the  We are going to back them down on cutting We are going to back them down on cutting education. We are going to back them down on cutting the budget for all of these great programs. We are going to have this battle. They already know it, but it is not going to stop them in terms of the first two programs, the tax cuts and the defense increases. They are going to still try to ram them through. That just creates bigger and bigger and bigger deficits.  The only way they can get away with it is if they can project massive economic growth in our country, which is the ``rosy scenario.'' Then you have a bunch of economists who are kind of supply-siders who kind of look back at the 1980s and ask: Can't we go back to the Reagan era again and repeat that?  You don't want to repeat it. The guy who put the program together said: Please don't do that again. Please don't do that again. He said here: Ronald Reagan chose not to be a leader but a politician, and in doing so, showed why passion and imperfection, not reason and doctrine, rule the world. ``His obstinacy,'' said David Stockman, ``was destined to keep America's economy hostage to the errors of his advisers for a long, long time.''  Mark Twain used to say that ``history doesn't repeat itself, but it does tend to rhyme.'' So, yes, this isn't exactly like Ronald Reagan in 1981 and 1982, but it rhymes with 1981 and 1982. It rhymes with it. They are trying to argue economics like lawyers, right? Politicians, PR people. Sell the bill of goods. Donald Trump calls it ``truthful hyperbole,'' like when he is selling a piece of property. Well, the United States is not a piece of property. The American economy is not a piece of property. It is the central organizing principle for all of the hopes and all of the dreams of every person who lives in our country.  You cannot allow for knowingly false premises to be advanced, and that is what Congressman Mulvaney will represent in this entire process if he is confirmed as the new head of the Office of Management and He represents someone who is going to reach back into time to this era which has already been shown to have completely failed and repeat the exact same experiment again. The American people just can't run the risk because ultimately the economic catastrophe--the impact on ordinary families--would be so great that ultimately we would look back and say that this Senate failed, that we did not discharge our responsibilities to those families.  So from my perspective, I stand out here knowing that once again we are faced with this prospect of repeating David Stockman's book ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed'' and knowing that when Donald Trump said: Oh, don't worry, I am going to take care of you, ordinary Americans; you are going to get the biggest tax breaks--they are not. That is not his plan.  Oh, don't worry. I am going to give you better healthcare. I am going to give you more coverage for your families.  That is not going to happen. That is not his plan.  I am going to give you cleaner air and cleaner water. It is going to be the best. It is going to be the greatest.  That is not going to happen.  It is the triumph of politics. It is the triumph of the special interests, of the oil and gas industry, of the defense establishment that wants bigger and more contracts, of the wealthiest who want big tax breaks. It is the triumph of politics--the politics of the most powerful, of the wealthiest, of the most entrenched. That is what this Trump administration is already about, and they are going to continue to say: Don't worry. Your healthcare will be better. Your air will be cleaner. Your children will be safer. Social Security will be protected.  But then who gets named to run the Office of Management and Budget? Somebody who wants to raise the retirement age to 70; someone who wants to fundamentally change Medicare as we know it; somebody who has an agenda that looks a lot like 1981 and 1982 in the Reagan years, very much like it.  So is there anything new here? Is this just a sales job, a con job? Because when you pull back the covers and you look at what is about to unfold, it is something that is going to be very destructive of our economy. It is going to further income inequality across our country. It is going to reduce opportunity for every child in our country. Rather than democratizing access to opportunity through healthcare and education, they are going to work systematically to undermine those opportunities, to reduce the chances that they can maximize their God-given abilities.  That is why this nomination is so important, because the OMB controls the Federal budget. That is all the hopes and all the dreams. That is where the money goes. Who gets it? What are the incentives?  Right now, once again, Donald Trump is embracing Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics: the more money you give to the people who are already rich, the more it will trickle down to ordinary folks.  We don't hear him saying: Oh, don't worry, the overwhelming majority of these tax breaks are going to go to the blue-collar people in our country. You are not going to hear him say that. And when you look at all the proposals they have made, it always goes to the corporations, it always goes to the upper 1 or 2 percentile.  Those promises he made are just the same as David Stockman's and Ronald Reagan's back in 1981 and 1982--identical almost down to the final detail--and are just as guaranteed to fail.  We have Congressman Mulvaney who has been nominated. And give him credit--he is actually honest about what he believes. He is actually very clear in his explanation of what the goals are going to be for our country if he is confirmed and can partner with Donald Trump to implement this agenda. We give him credit for his honesty, but it is only honesty in saying that he is going to defend a set of economic assumptions that are completely and totally fallacious and have already been disproved in the marketplace--the political marketplace.  So all I can say here is that it would be reckless of the Senate to deliver over to the American people once again someone whose intent is to try to take this formula which gathers voluminous amounts of information to defend knowingly erroneous premises.[[Page S1187]]  You cannot have massive tax cuts and massive increases in defense spending and balance the budget without killing all of these programs that almost every American family relies on, beginning with Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, education programs, all the way down. We can't do it.  So that is why we are fighting out here. We are fighting to make sure we don't repeat the same history we have already lived through.  By the time Reagan reached near the end of his career, guess what he did. He changed and began to acclimate himself to reality. He began to accept, through a group of new advisers, the actual impact his initial policies were having. And that is all we are trying to do right now. We are trying to start out where we are going to be forced to wind up anyway. Why not do that since we have already learned the lesson? Why not have those lessons of the past be implemented? But no. They are committed to a repetition syndrome, a reenactment of what has already occurred, rather than a reconciliation with history, learning from it and then trying to move forward in a way which is wise, protective of every  I stand here to oppose Congressman Mulvaney's nomination for the Office of Management and I do not believe it would be a good thing for our country, for our economy. This is just too dangerous a roll of the dice with our entire So I say to the Senate, please vote to reject this nomination, and ask the President to nominate someone who does reflect the best economic values that our country has.

968,topic-id,1461,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee asked Scott Pruitt for critical information on his environmental record as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt said no to the Environment and Public Works  When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee asked our fellow Republicans to delay Mr.Pruitt's vote until he got that important information, the Republican leadership here said: No, we won't wait for that critical information so that all Senators and the American people can understand who is being nominated.  When I asked Scott Pruitt if he would recuse himself from all issues relating to the cases that he has brought against the EPA as Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt said no to me.  Today we are here to respond to these very serious issues that are being raised about his ability to be an impartial Administrator of the EPA because the question before the American people and the Senate is whether Scott Pruitt should be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and that answer is no.  The EPA is our cop on the beat, protecting the American people and our environment from harmful pollution, hazardous waste, and the impacts of climate change. But as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt has tried to undermine the clean water rule and the Clean Air Act, putting the public health of millions of Americans at risk.  Scott Pruitt questions the science of climate change. Scott Pruitt has accused the EPA of overestimating air pollution from drilling of natural gas wells in Scott Pruitt has argued against President Obama's Clean Power Plan, which the EPA is supposed to implement. Scott Pruitt has sued to block the EPA from restricting mercury, a toxin that causes brain damage in children in the United  The only thing that Scott Pruitt is certain of is that he wants to represent the interests of the fossil fuel industry. He wants to change the environmental watchdog into a polluter lapdog. And today we are drawing a line out here on the Senate floor because it is critical that the American people understand the moral implications for the water Americans drink, for the air they breathe, for the mercury that could go into the blood systems of children in our country, for the amount of smog that is allowed to be sent into the air, the amount of haze that is created across our country, and why the nomination of Scott Pruitt leads inevitably, inexplicably toward more pollution, more unhealthy air, and more unhealthy water going into the systems of our families across our country.  That really goes to what the moral duty is of the Senate, the moral duty we have to ordinary families across the country. Do Americans really think the air we are breathing is too clean? Do people really believe the water we drink is too clean? Do people really want to water down those standards? Do they want to reduce the safeguards we have put in place?  One hundred years ago, life expectancy in the United States was about 48 years of age. In other words, we had gone from the Garden of Eden all the way to about 100 years ago, and we had increased life expectancy to about 48 years of age--not much progress. Now, it was always good for the Methuselah family. The wealthy always did pretty well. They could protect themselves from the things that would affect ordinary families, poorer families, from the Bible to 100 years ago. But then what happened? All of a sudden there was an awakening in our country that we had to make sure the sewage systems in our country were not going to be able to pollute families across our society. Then step by step, beginning with sewage and water, we in our Nation came to understand that we had to remove the majority of pollutants that were out there that were damaging the lives of ordinary That was a change that transformed not just the United States but, over time, the whole rest of the world.  Now, 100 years later, life expectancy goes out to age 80. In other words, we have added 32 years of bonus life to the average American over the last 100 years. And what did it? Well, it is no[[Page S1248]]secret formula; it is just that we looked around and we saw the things we had to put in place in order to protect families, and we took a moral responsibility to make sure that those industries, especially those that were not providing protections, were forced to provide protections for those ordinary people.  Here we are now considering Scott Pruitt as the new Administrator of the Environmental Protection Here is what Mr.Pruitt has done as the attorney general of Oklahoma: He has sued the national Environmental Protection Agency for the State of Oklahoma 19 times, and the issues on which he has sued are almost a litany of the things that go right to the heart of the protections the American people want for their families.  There are still eight cases that he brought pending before the  I said to Scott Pruitt in the confirmation hearing: Attorney General Pruitt, will you recuse yourself from consideration of any of those eight pending cases during the time you are Administrator of the EPA if you are confirmed? And Mr.Pruitt said no. Well, as I said to him in the hearing, if you do not recuse yourself, Mr.Pruitt, that turns you into the plaintiff, the defendant, the judge, and the jury for all of those cases, and that is just an unconscionable conflict of interest. As a result, he would never be seen as an impartial Administrator at the EPA as he moved forward trying to repeal or weaken environmental protections through regulations that he originally sought to accomplish through litigation.  We all know that across our country, overwhelmingly, the American people want--in the highest possible polling numbers, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative--they want the EPA to protect clean air, clean water, public health. They don't want children unnecessarily being exposed to pollutants in the atmosphere that can cause asthma. Those numbers are going up. The goal in America is to see the numbers go down, but that will not be the agenda Scott Pruitt brings to the EPA if he is, in fact, confirmed.  This question of his fitness for this job also goes to the question of climate change. The science of climate change is now well established.  Pope Francis came to the Capitol a year and a half ago to deliver his sermon on the hill to us, and what Pope Francis said to us is very simple: 1, that the planet is dangerously warming and that it is something which is being caused by human activity largely and that those who are going to be most adversely affected are the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. As the Pope said, we have a moral responsibility to do something about it as the most powerful country in the world and, along with China, the leading polluter in the world. This is Pope Francis talking to us about climate change.  What does Scott Pruitt say about climate science? He says he is not quite certain any actions really have to be taken in order to deal with that issue. Well, we have a Pope who actually taught high school chemistry and who delivered a science and morality lesson to the He told us that science is certain, and he told us that our moral obligation is unavoidable.  If we had a nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency who embraced that science and morality, I would be voting for him, but that is not who Scott Pruitt is. He is ignoring the impact the fossil fuel industry is having, and he is unwilling to commit to taking steps that can reduce that danger for our planet and for the most vulnerable on the planet.  So I stand in opposition to his nomination, as I will be standing out here all day and into the night. I don't think that we are going to have a more important discussion than the direction of the health of our planet and the health of the children in our country. I think it is something that the American people have to hear all day and through the night.  With that, I see the arrival of the Senator from I know that he has time to speak on the Senate floor.

Bare walls, empty desks, shuttered restaurants--all of these things--show us just how essential, how fundamental immigrants are to our economy and to the very fabric of our  Now imagine if tomorrow we recognized a day without the Environmental Protection Imagine that--with no Environmental Protection Agency; no Clean Air Act enforcement; no clean water rule enforcement; no one to clean up abandoned Superfund and toxic waste sites; more climate change; more kids with asthma; more rivers with toxins running through them; more families with cancer; more environmental injustice for communities of color because it is those communities, the most vulnerable communities, that will suffer the worst consequences on a day without the  If Scott Pruitt has his way, it won't just be a day without the It could be a nation without the That is what Scott Pruitt wants. That is what congressional Republicans want. That is what Donald Trump wants--no more clean air and water protections, no more pollution controls, no more environmental justice. That is Scott Pruitt's favorite day. That is Scott Pruitt's  That is why we are out here tonight. We are out here tonight to begin this warning to the country that there is trouble brewing if Scott Pruitt is, in fact, confirmed as the next head of the Environmental Protection  What is it that we can look forward to?  The oil, the gas, the coal industries opposed many of the Obama administration's commonsense protections for our air, for our water, for our climate.  One by one, Republicans in Congress are working to legislatively overturn many of those protections. They now have twice deployed a very rarely used procedural tool known as the Congressional Review Act to benefit the coal, the oil, the gas industries by rolling back environmental protections. Republicans are planning to use the Congressional Review Act to hand out even more giveaways to the fossil fuel industries in the coming weeks.  You can pick any industry you want--coal, oil, mining, timber, grazing. You go through, and no matter how you spin it on the Republican ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' some industry gets a big giveaway. They are trying to decide right now what is the next one they will bring out here that waters down the protections that the American people need in each and every one of these areas. But don't question for a second if that is what this whole year is going to be about. Just take oil. There will be big tax breaks for oil coming very, very soon--like they need it. The same thing is going to be true in area after area. We have our helpful tool here, the GOP ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' to help viewers at home keep track of which industries the Republicans are making the weekly winners.  Now, by nominating Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, President Trump and Senate Republicans have found their new host for this great Republican show--the ``Wheel of Giveaways''--and that will be Scott Pruitt, attorney general of Oklahoma, because Scott Pruitt has already made a career of handing out prizes to the fossil fuel industry in our country.  As attorney general of Oklahoma, he sued to block the EPA from restricting toxic mercury pollution from powerplants in order to benefit the coal industry--that is right--blocking protections from mercury that could affect the lungs of children in his own State and, ultimately, across the whole country.  Then, as attorney general of Oklahoma, he questioned the EPA's estimate of air pollution from new natural gas wells in By doing that, he took natural gas and oil, and he made sure that would, as well, be something that wasn't subject to the types of regulations that were necessary in order to protect the public health and safety.  Then he moved on, as attorney general of Oklahoma, to push for a rollback of protections of our Nation's waterways to the benefit of corporate polluters. Corporate polluters love to use the waterways of our country as one big sewer. Why do you have to store that dirty water? Why do you have to make sure that it is just not put in some safe place when you can just use rivers? Just dump all of that garbage right in the river. Put all of that pollution right in the river. Who cares what impact it has upon families? Who cares what impact it has upon children?  So, again, this ``Wheel of Giveaways'' is really a way to ensure that the polluting industries don't have to pay to clean up the messes they create, just pass it on to innocent families, because with Scott Pruitt as the new host of the Republican ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' we know who will always win every time, every week, during all 4 years of the Trump administration. It will always be the oil industry, the natural gas industry, the coal industry, the polluters of all stripes that otherwise the EPA would be regulating and protecting the public health and safety of our country.[[Page S1293]]  It is going to ultimately be those American families who are left to lose protections which for generations we have fought to put on the books in order to ensure that we increase life expectancy and reduce exposure to asthma and other diseases that otherwise, because of these polluting companies, are going to be visited upon hundreds of thousands and millions of families within our country.  When we think about this whole issue of the environment, many times we say: Well, the Republicans--the coal industry, they say there is a War on Coal in the United States of America, an absolute war, a war out there to destroy the industry. However, upon closer examination, it turns out that it is the free market that has been working to replace coal with other sources of energy.  A decade ago--here are the numbers--50 percent of all electricity in the United States came from coal; now it is down to 30 percent of all electricity in our country. What has replaced coal? Well, the free market has actually substituted natural gas, which has grown from a little over 20 percent of U.electrical generation a decade ago to 35 percent of all electricity in our country right now. And coal has been replaced by clean energy--by wind, which has grown to 5 to 6 percent of our generation from almost nothing, and solar, which is up to 1 percent of all of our electrical generation. And between wind and solar, there are additions of 1.5 percent every single year between those two sources, to renewable electrical generation capacity in our country. So we can see that every year that goes by--over a 15-year period, for example, that would be 22 percent of all electricity would be wind and solar if we just keep on the current pace.  From the coal industry's perspective, that is terrible. That is a War on Coal, what natural gas is doing, what wind and solar are doing. But the reality is that they are losing it in the marketplace. Adam Smith is spinning in his grave--so quickly, by the way, that he would actually probably qualify as a new source of energy. So the Republican complaint is that the free market is killing coal; it is a war. It is capitalism, actually, and it is working. So the only way they can stop it, the only way they can slow it down, is to get somebody like Scott Pruitt to be the new head of the Environmental Protection This isn't a conspiracy; it is actually a competition, and the competition for those clean energy jobs is global.  Back in the 1990s, I was the author of a law that moved over 200 megahertz of spectrum. In 1993 in America, the average phone that was wireless was the size of a brick. It looked like the phone Gordon Gekko had in the movie ``Wall Street.'' People didn't have one. It cost 50 cents a minute. But I was able to move over 200 megahertz of spectrum in 1993, and four new companies were able to compete. They both went digital, and by 1996, this is what people had in their pocket--under 10 cents a minute, and all of a sudden everyone had this phone. It just killed that phone that was the size of a brick.  But then another remarkable thing happened. Within 8 or 10 more years, there was a guy out in Silicon Valley, and he came up with an idea for an iPhone, and that revolution just kept moving because we had opened it up to competition.  You can imagine there were devotees to the black rotary dial phone who kept saying: Oh my goodness, it is a war on the black rotary dial phone, all of these new devices. But it wasn't. It was just technology. It was a revolution. It was capitalism, and it had finally been opened to that competition after 100 years.  Well, that is what has happened in electrical generation. We finally have passed laws that open it up to competition. It is not a secret. And the only way to shut it down is to have someone like Scott Pruitt as the head of the EPA because then, all of a sudden, you can have an EPA chief who says: We are not going to have any new rules on climate change. We are not going to have any more rules that reduce the amount of pollution that goes up into the atmosphere. We are not going to have any more rules that ensure that President Obama's Clean Power Plan is implemented in our country, which would again telescope the timeframe that it would take in order to deploy these massive amounts of new renewable electricity sources in our country and expedite the pace at which natural gas resources get deployed in our country.  So that is really what this is all about. It is a special interest giveaway--pick your industry. How do we protect it? How do we make sure we don't move beyond the 20th century? How do we not have this incredible green generation be able to invent the new energy technologies of this century, the same way that they invented the new telecommunications technologies at the end of the 20th century? How do we stop them? Well, you have to really find people who are willfully committed to it.  Let's go to Scott Scott Pruitt, as the attorney general of Oklahoma, unbelievably sued the EPA 19 times. Now, what attorney general sues the EPA 19 times? Well, let's look at the subjects he sued on--clean air, clean water, soot, mercury, haze. It is almost like a laundry list of the dirtiest issues that America would want us to have an Environmental Protection Agency working on. And he sued over and over and over again. And even as he is being considered for confirmation, after I questioned him in the hearing, saying: Will you recuse yourself from any consideration of any issue that you have already sued the agency on that is still pending, he said he would not recuse himself.  So I said to Mr.Pruitt in that hearing: Well, if you don't recuse yourself and you still have eight pending cases, that will make you the plaintiff, the defendant, the judge, and the jury on these matters that are at the heart of the clean air, clean water agenda that the American people want to see implemented in the 21st century.  What was he doing in Oklahoma? What was he trying to accomplish? Well, I decided to ask Mr.Pruitt some questions.  Question 1: I asked Mr.Pruitt to describe the actions he took as Oklahoma's attorney general to enforce the State's environmental laws. His response: He told me to go file an open records request.  Secondly, I asked Mr.Pruitt how much of the budget he controlled as attorney general did he devote to Oklahoma's Office of Environmental Do you know what he told me? He said: Go file an open records request.  3: I asked Mr.Pruitt how many individuals he employed in the Office of Environmental Do you know what his answer was? You are asking for too much information. Go file an open records request.  4: I learned that Mr.Pruitt had hired one of his campaign contributors to sue the EPA, so I asked him to show me the contract. And do you know what he told me? You are right. You guessed it. He told me to go file an open records request.  So his answer to me over and over again was go FOIA yourself. But that is not a sufficient answer to a Member of Congress because we actually get the right to ask for critical information on the environmental records of those who are applying for the job of chief environmental protector of our country. And if you are looking for evidence to convict Scott Pruitt on the charge of protecting public health and the environment, he is unwilling to give it to you.  During his confirmation hearing, we heard a lot about Scott Pruitt respecting States' rights. Scott Pruitt's record shows that he is in favor of States' rights but only when it is good for the State of Oklahoma and the oil industry of When I asked him about protecting the rights of States like California and Massachusetts to do more to protect their environment, he declined to support their rights to do that for their  So under Scott Pruitt, EPA is going to turn into Every Polluter's He won't be there as the cop on the beat to ensure that those protections are in place to ensure that every American--all 320 million--is given the protections they need. It will no longer be an Agency that is a watchdog for the environment; this is an Agency that is going to be a lap dog for polluters across our country. And if that is the case, then we are going to see a rollback in the health, the safety of those protections that all Americans have come to expect in the area of the environment.[[Page S1294]]  When we raised the issues of his conflict of interest in the committee, we received unsatisfactory answers. When we raised the issues of providing us the information we were going to need in order to fully understand his complete record, we were not given the answers we need.  Now let me once again come back to 1981 and 1982. What did James Watt do at the Department of Interior? Well, he wound up selling off for bargain-basement prices the coal resources in the Powder River Basin in It was a scandal of massive proportion. It led to his resignation. It was avoidable but predictable because he made very clear what his attitude was about all of these resources.  The same thing was true over at the EPA with Anne It was an Agency that the Reagan administration, in actual reports, said that the goal of the EPA Administrator would be to bring the Agency to its knees--to its knees--and that became the goal during the Gorsuch time at the So another resignation.  We have here with Scott Pruitt someone who has the same agenda, the same goals, and the same unfortunate allies to accomplish those goals.  So I am going to continue, along with my colleagues, for the rest of the evening to bring this case to the American people. We believe this is a preview of coming attractions. We want America to know who Scott Pruitt is because when he begins to take action in March, in April, and in May, if he is confirmed, then they will know who he is very simply because everything we are saying tonight is going to be a preview of those coming attractions.  So at this point, I reserve the remainder of my time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1044,topic-id,982,"Mr.President, earlier today I spoke on the floor about Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt and his nomination to lead the Environmental Protection Since that time, an Oklahoma judge has now ruled that Scott Pruitt must comply with a 2-year-old request to release email correspondence between the attorney general's office and fossil fuel companies, like oil company Devon Energy and coal company Murray  After an over 2-year struggle, these communications will finally come to light starting next Tuesday, but the Senate is due to vote on Scott Pruitt's nomination tomorrow afternoon, Friday, at 1 p.m. Now, that smells to the high heavens. The American people in the Senate have a right to know what is in all of those emails that have finally been ordered to be released by a court. Instead, what the Republican leadership is going to do is rush to judgment, forcing Members of the Senate to vote on this confirmation without knowing what is in all of these emails that have been subject to litigation for the last 2 years.  Now, it is a little bit fishy because Republicans have been obsessed with emails for over 2 years. They have spent millions of dollars on attempts to gain access to emails during the Presidential campaign, but now they are denying the Senate and the American public the right to examine Scott Pruitt's emails. That, again, is not The only thing Senate Republicans seem to want to deny more than climate change is the right of Senators to review these 3,000 emails. That, again, is not So we are going to be in a very funny situation at 1 tomorrow afternoon. The emails are on the way. We are going to find out what was in all of those emails. We are going to find out what kind of correspondence Attorney General Pruitt had with all of these different entities with which he was communicating, but the Senators will not have it for a basis of casting a vote.  Now, maybe it is benign, but maybe it is not. Maybe that is why this vote is being rushed. It is being rushed so the Senators don't know what is in there; that they are blind as they vote. Then, as each email becomes public, as each new revelation becomes public in the weeks and months ahead, people are going to look back at this body and they are going to say: Why could you not wait just another week so Senators could know what was in those emails? I think there is a reason why many people have arched eyebrows that are going up so high that it would hit the roof a ceiling. There is a reason to be skeptical that something is happening here that is meant to be a rush to judgment to avoid all of the evidence being placed in front of the Senators and the American people in terms of his nomination.  Members of the faith community are weighing in as well. They have opposed Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I want to read portions of a letter that the bishops of the Episcopal Church of Massachusetts sent to President Trump:       The Episcopal Church stands strongly for the protection of      the environment. We respect the facts of science. We support      the laws and policies that address the reality of climate      change.       Our respect for our government leaders and our reverence      for the earth as God's creation impel us to write you to      express our dismay about your selection of Scott Pruitt to      head the Environmental Protection  These are the bishops of the Episcopal Church of They continue:       We wonder why a person who has consistently and adamantly      opposed all laws and policies that provide even minimal      ``protection'' to the environment should be entrusted with      leading such an agency.       President-elect Trump, you have promised economic      development. Like you, we value a stable and prosperous      economy. However, a thriving economy depends on a healthy      environment. The more we weaken and dismantle the E.P.A.'s      vital protections of our natural world, the more we threaten      the common good.       You have also promised to strengthen our national defense.      Like you, we value national security. However, our country's      top military intelligence have concluded that climate change      is a ``threat multiplier'' that is already creating      instability around the world and will likely create      significant security challenges in the years ahead. If      someone who casts doubt on the reality of climate change      becomes the head of the E.P.A., our national security will be      compromised.       As citizens of this beloved country, we intend to write our      members of Congress, urging them to block the nomination of      Scott Pruitt to lead the E.P.We will pray for a better      choice.

This is a moral issue of the highest magnitude. The leaders of religions all across our country are praying for us, begging us to do something in order to protect this planet. Scott Pruitt does not intend on taking those actions.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1046,topic-id,1267,"Mr.President, I want to continue on the subject that I was just referencing. This is a story from Oklahoma that is on the wires right now across the country.  Headline: ``Judge orders Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to release emails related to fossil fuel industry.''  Let me read a little bit of this news story. This is Oklahoma       A judge has ruled that Americans have a right to know how      much of a relationship Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt      has with oil and gas leaders before becoming the head of the      Environmental Protection       For years, Pruitt has been an outspoken adversary of the      EPA and is currently suing the agency.[[Page S1295]]       In December, President Donald Trump selected Pruitt to lead      the agency despite concerns from lawmakers.       A 2014 New York Times report claimed that Pruitt's ties to      Devon Energy Corporation directly influenced decisions he      made while in office in       Through open records requests, the New York Times obtained      a letter written by Devon's attorneys, which was then taken      to       The article states, ``The attorney general's staff had      taken Devon's draft, copied it onto state government      stationery with only a few word changes, and sent it to      Washington with the attorney general's signature.''       In 2014, KFOR asked for a comment to the allegations, but      received a statement focusing on the benefits of the oil      industry. . . . Six Senators from the Senate Environment and      Public Works Committee asked Pruitt to list his connections      to energy companies so they can decide whether those      interactions will affect how he will run the . . . The      Center for Media and Democracy filed nine open records      requests with the AG's office, beginning in January 2015.       ``Probably the largest request we have is for      communication: emails, phone calls, [and] scheduling related      to his involvement with various energy companies, as well as      his involvement with the republican attorney general's      association,'' attorney Blake Lawrence said.       The group alleges that Pruitt received nearly $350,000 in      campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry. They      want his dealings with those in the industry made public--and      soon.       ``Just last week our office contacted the Center for Media      and Democracy to notify them that release of their request      was imminent. The fact that they have now filed suit despite      our ongoing communications demonstrates that this is nothing      more than political theater,'' AG spokesman Lincoln Ferguson      said in a statement.       According to the Hill, Democrats asked Pruitt for the      documents as part of his confirmation hearing, but he      declined. Instead, he told them to file public records      requests themselves.       Now, a judge has ordered the Oklahoma Attorney General's      Office to turn over close to 3,000 documents related to      Pruitt's communications with oil, gas, and coal companies,      according to E&E       Pruitt's office has until Tuesday to release the emails,      but his confirmation vote was originally believed to be held      Friday, 17.  Meaning today, in 5 more minutes.       ``Scott Pruitt and Senate Republicans have made a mockery      of the confirmation process, permitting the nominee to escape      scrutiny and hide his deep ties to the fossil fuel industry.      What is he hiding in all of these emails? The vote to confirm      Pruitt must now be delayed until every senator can see just      who Pruitt is and what he will do if permitted to run the      EPA,'' a statement from the Sierra Club read.  That is where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen. We are 6 minutes to midnight on Thursday night. The vote is now scheduled in 13 hours 5 minutes here on the Senate floor.  These emails are going to be released next Tuesday so there can be a public examination of them, to finally determine what is the relationship between Scott Pruitt and these industries that he will be given responsibility to regulate.  What are they hiding? Why are they rushing? Why will they not give the American people the ability to find out what is inside these emails before there is a vote on the Senate floor? Because once that vote takes place, he will be the head of EPA, and then we will find out what conflicts may exist, what relationships may exist, what decisions had been made. But, no, the Senate leadership will not give the American people the respect they deserve to ensure that all of that information is out for public viewing so they can make an informed judgment as to the exact nature of the relationships between this nominee for the EPA and industries that he has had responsibility for regulating in Oklahoma and he will have responsibility for regulating as the head of the national Environmental Protection  It is an absolutely unacceptable policy to know that critical information that makes it possible for the public and the Senate to understand a candidate for such a powerful office is to be available and yet not in fact considered as part of this historic decision.  For me, it is a ``March of Folly.'' It is just another example of how the Republican Party, the GOP, has become the gas and oil party. That is really what it stands for now, just committed to ensuring that they cover up what is in these emails. They don't give the public the chance to be able to understand what these potentially explosive relationships may be so the Senate can deliberate fully on whether Mr.Pruitt does in fact qualify to be an impartial head of the Environmental Protection Agency of our country and ultimately of the world because the world looks to us to determine where climate change is going, where environmental protections are going, not just for our own citizens but for theirs as well. What we do is replicated inevitably, inextricably in the rest of the world.  This man will have one of the most powerful positions on the planet. Emails are available right now if we just wait to help us in our deliberation. It is really a tragedy. It is a sad commentary upon this institution that rather than just delaying, examining, and then giving the public the information they need in the Senate, instead we rush to judgment. We rush to judgment, but ultimately the judgment of history is going to be on us if it is determined, through these emails, that Mr.Pruitt is unqualified for this position; that the conflicts which he has had disqualify him for this position; that the emails disclosed to us the conflicts of interest that are going to ultimately impair his ability to be impartial in his regulation of clean air and clean water and mercury and haze and soot and smog and this whole litany of issues that go right to the public health and safety of every  From my perspective, it is a sad day in the Senate when the information is now available, a brief delay would make it possible for each Senator to be able to make an informed decision, and yet the Senate moves on, not waiting, not listening, not willing to give the American public the information they will need to make an informed decision that they can then give to their Senators to make a wise decision that could lead to much stronger protections that they can receive from this critical Agency that is the overseer of the environment in our country.  Again, I oppose Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I would ask for a delay. I know it is not going to happen. I understand why, but it is a sad day in the history of the  Mr.President, I wish to reclaim the remainder of my time and yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,735,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February

I met some of the most humble and compassionate people that I have ever known. I chose to serve alongside the IDF because our friends in Israel fight for the same values that we fight to protect in our country: human dignity, freedom, and liberty.  I can tell you from experience that we soldiers often label our uniforms with sentiments that are important to us. Hadar had his rifle belt embroidered[[Page H1135]]with the words ``strength and humility.'' He fought not out of hatred for his enemy but to protect his homeland and his family. He used the embroidery as a reminder that a soldier has the courage to use his weapon when needed, but even more importantly, has the humility to restrain from its use in the name of peace.  But on August 1, 2014, when Hadar was only 23 years old, he was killed by Hamas terrorists, just 2 hours after a ceasefire had been declared in the Operation Protective Edge war in Hamas terrorists maliciously dragged his body away from his home and into an underground tunnel. They stripped and left his clothing and have held his corpse ever since.  Americans are no strangers to the term ``missing in action,'' as we still have, shamefully, thousands unaccounted for in Southeast This is a painful and uncertain future that no family deserves. This should never, ever be condoned.  Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Hadar's family. They are unable to give their son the proper burial because Hamas is holding his body hostage.  Mr.Speaker, we know that Hamas does not value human life. They seek to destroy all that Israel and the United States hold dear. Even the last administration called for the condemning of this action in the strongest possible terms. They called it barbaric. We must now enter into a new chapter--one where we support our Israeli allies and stand side by side with them in the fight for freedom.  This was a ceasefire that Israel entered into at the urging of former Secretary of State John Kerry and the United They should bear some responsibility for ensuring his body is returned home.  Mr.Speaker, I urge the United Nations to step up for what is right. Show some spine, show some resolve, and stand against Do not be a rug that Palestinians trounce across as they shop the United Nations to fulfill their agenda while never being held accountable for their acts of terrorism and their acts against basic human dignity.  I urge the new administration to take the necessary steps to help bring Hadar home and ensure his family can finally give him a proper burial--the kind of burial that every soldier, regardless of their uniform, deserves.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1134-2.txt,2322,1730,2017.0,14.0,February

1140,topic-id,2069,"Madam President, I rise today in strong opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the Admininstrator of the Environmental Protection  When looking at Mr.Pruitt's record on environmental issues, it is almost hard to know where to start.  You could examine his history of climate denial, in which he has repeatedly rejected the scientific consensus on the threat of climate change.  You could look at his cozy relationship with the oil and gas industry during his tenure as attorney general of  You could argue that Scott Pruitt represents the same corporate interests and crony capitalism that have long prevailed inside the  You could discuss his refusal to answer basic questions from the Environment and Public Works Committee, even as he asks those same Senators to vote for his confirmation.  Any one of these items should be disqualifying for a candidate tasked with leading the EPA, but the list of problems with Mr.Pruitt's nomination goes even beyond those concerns.  His nomination threatens the very foundations of the department he has been tasked with leading--whether you are talking about the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Superfund Program, or any of the other cornerstone environmental protections Americans have long enjoyed.  Scott Pruitt has made a career out of characterizing these environmental protections as red-tape, as job-killers, and as government overreach.  That might be good rhetoric when you are arguing on the side of corporate polluters, as Mr.Pruitt has spent his career doing.  It might be good rhetoric when you are trying to mask the significant benefits of the laws you are fighting to unravel.  It might be good rhetoric, but it is not reality. The reality is that our Nation's environmental laws are designed to provide basic protections for human health and quality of life.[[Page S1373]]  But that fact is often obscured by the rhetoric that Mr.Pruitt peddles. And since the EPA and many of its foundational laws were created decades ago, it can be easy to forget what the world looked like before we had strong environmental protections.  So before we confirm an EPA Administrator intent on dismantling every one of those protections, let's do a quick history lesson.  Democrat, Republican, or Independent, one thing that Americans agree on is the need for clean water. In fact, according to a 2016 Gallup poll, 61 percent of all Americans are ``a great deal'' worried--not a little worried, but a great deal worried--about pollution of drinking water, and 56 percent of all Americans are ``a great deal'' worried--again, a great deal worried--about the pollution of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.  Among hunters and anglers, a group that many of my friends across the aisle claim to champion, those numbers are even more dramatic. A 2015 poll found that nearly 90 percent thought that the Clean Water Act was a good thing, and 75 percent supported the application of the Clean Water Act to headwater streams and wetlands.  Now, at a time when a strong majority of Americans are so concerned about the quality of their drinking water and the cleanliness of waterways across the country and support the application and enforcement of the Clean Water Act, it seems that we should be working to strengthen the protections that keep our water clean.  But that is not what Scott Pruitt has done, and it is not what he will do if we allow him to become the Administrator of the No, instead Scott Pruitt has worked tirelessly to gut the Clean Water  His lawsuits have sought to undermine the fundamental protections afforded to our waterways to the detriment of the health of our families and our environment.  He has sued to prevent the Clean Water Rule, a court-ordered clarification of the protections of the Clean Water Act, from going into effect.  He has joined lawsuits and filed briefs to make it easier for mining companies to dump waste and fill material anywhere they want, destroying mountain streams and negatively impacting water quality.  Scott Pruitt didn't feel that the EPA should even have the authority to conduct a survey about industrial farming practices that can generate toxic runoff that could find its way into our rivers and streams and drinking water resources.  He has even joined big polluters in a lawsuit against a collaborative effort by Chesapeake Bay States and the EPA to clean up the bay, despite the fact that it had nothing to do with  I think that Mr.Pruitt's views can best be summed up in his own words. He claims that, ``the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''  Well, I have news for Scott When the EPA doesn't lead, cost-cutting measures undertaken by a State can lead to thousands of Americans being poisoned by lead in their water. When the EPA doesn't lead, polluters, blinded by the pursuit of profit above all else, can dump unlimited and unregulated amounts of pollution into our water.  This isn't speculation. We have seen it before. The Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 in large part due to public outrage after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969. Yes, the river caught fire. This sounds outlandish and incredible to us today, but perhaps even more astounding is the fact that this was not necessarily abnormal. It wasn't the result of some single incident or accidental spill. This was the result of years of pollution and unsound practices employed by many different industries across the economic spectrum.  The Washington Post notes that the Cuyahoga burned at least 13 times, and that is just one river. River fires were recorded in Maryland, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and other States as well. So it becomes clear that this was a pervasive problem, and a national problem, and a problem that had to be addressed on the national level. And we did address it largely through the Clean Water Act, but we have to continue that progress, not roll it back. Even now, in places like China, where strong federal clean water laws don't exist, these river fires still occur.  Scott Pruitt calls himself an ``advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.''  If fighting for clean water is an activist agenda; if enforcing sound environmental practices that safeguard public health is an activist agenda; if protecting wetlands that not only provide critical wildlife habitat, but also act as vital buffers that protect our communities from flooding, is an activist agenda; well, then I guess you can call me an activist, and his record has shown that Scott Pruitt is anything but. And his attacks on the Clean Water Act aren't unique. Mr.Pruitt has sued the EPA time and again in an effort to dismantle the Clean Air  The Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970, at a time that many of our Nation's cities and industrial regions were blanketed in smog. In the 47 years since the passage of the law, the Clean Air Act has proven to be one of the most effective public health measures ever taken in this country. Under the Clean Air Act, we have achieved 70 percent reductions in the levels of six of the most dangerous air pollutants.  Under the Clean Air Act, new heavy-duty trucks and buses became 99 percent cleaner than those vehicles were in the 1970s. Under the Clean Air Act, lead was banned from gasoline, ending a significant health risk--one that was particularly dangerous for children. It was the Clean Air Act that gave us the tools to drastically cut the pollutants that cause acid rain. The Clean Air Act helps to protect downwind States like New Jersey from pollution emitted by power plants in other The Clean Air Act has been used to phase out pollutants that destroy the ozone layer, yielding significant health benefits including a reduction in skin cancer. The Clean Air Act has been used to reduce mercury from power plants, preventing tens of thousands of premature deaths, heart attacks, and asthma attacks. The Clean Air Act has helped reduce pollution at our National Parks, supporting tourism and local economies across the country. And in 2007, the Supreme Court affirmed the Clean Air Act's role in the environmental crisis of our time, the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect against the threat of climate change.  It is worth noting that, since the Clean Air Act became law, the Nation's gross domestic product grew by 246 percent--so much for job-killing regulations.  But in spite of these benefits, benefits that accrue to every American and benefits that save lives and reduce disease, Scott Pruitt has a record a mile long trying to dismantle the Clean Air  He sued the EPA over cross-state air pollution rules. He sued the EPA over mercury and air toxin limits. He sued the EPA when they tried to reduce smog. He sued the EPA when they limited pollution in national parks. And he sued the EPA when they proposed limiting carbon pollution from power plants.  Mr.Pruitt's record has repeatedly demonstrated that he has no interest in maintaining basic environmental standards. I have no reason to believe that he would behave any differently if confirmed as EPA But Scott Pruitt's disdain for the EPA goes beyond even the lawsuits he filed.  In questions for the record for the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr.Pruitt was asked to name even one EPA regulation he supported and he couldn't name even one.  He wasn't put on the spot. These were written questions, which Mr.Pruitt had ample time to consider and answer. And yet he couldn't produce a single example of an EPA standard he supported.  An EPA standard that immediately comes to my mind is Superfund--a bipartisan program committed to ensuring that polluters pay to clean up their toxic dump sites.  New Jersey has the most Superfund sites of any State in the Nation--114 total. These sites threaten public health, stifle economic opportunity, and undermine quality of life.  They are a toxic legacy from a time when we had no watchdog to prevent corporations from dumping their waste into our soil or our water.  Today there are over 1,300 Superfund sites throughout the Nation--13 sites in[[Page S1374]]Alabama, 37 sites in Wisconsin, 53 sites in Florida, and even 7 sites in Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt's home  This is a problem that transcends geographic and partisan divides. It is a challenge we should be united in our commitment to fixing. Yet Mr.Pruitt wouldn't even cite Superfund as an example of an EPA regulation he supported. If he doesn't support the program, how can we trust him to implement it?  EPA is absolutely critical in bringing the companies responsible for pollution to the table, creating strategies for cleaning up these sites, and overseeing the clean-ups themselves.  How can we trust Mr.Pruitt to negotiate on behalf of our communities if he can't even bring himself to admit the value of the law?  The fact that a program as basic and bipartisan as Superfund didn't garner Scott Pruitt's support should be of concern to us all.  The U.has many environmental challenges left to confront, but we have also made a lot of progress since the days before we had strong environmental protections.  We can't turn back the clock to the days when rivers caught on fire, when smog choked our cities, and when corporations were free to dump unlimited chemicals into the soil and water. Yet, that is exactly what Scott Pruitt has spent his career doing. His tenure as Oklahoma Attorney General provides example after example of legal actions taken on behalf of moneyed corporate polluters, but he failed to provide even one real example of action he took against polluters on behalf of the people of  I take my responsibility to provide advice and consent to the President on his nominees very seriously, and as I have looked into Mr.Pruitt's record, one thing has become abundantly clear. Scott Pruitt doesn't work for you. He works for the polluting industries that have bankrolled his political career. His nomination to head the EPA poses significant risk to our Nation's most basic environmental protections.  Protections like the Superfund program, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act have provided a legacy of health and wellness for millions of And time and time again, Mr.Pruitt has proven untrustworthy as a protector of that legacy.  For that reason, I oppose his nomination as Administrator of the EPA and urge my colleagues to do the same.

583,topic-id,2862,"Mr.President, here we are on another evening, debating another Cabinet nominee, addressing the question that Hamilton put before us, which is whether an individual is of fit character to serve in a particular post. This effort, this advice and consent responsibility held by the Senate, is one that was anticipated by our Founders to be used rarely because the very existence of this power, they felt, would ensure that a President would nominate people who are appropriately suited to the post they would hold. So I do find it troubling the number of times I have come to the floor in these last few weeks to speak about a nominee and consider whether they are fit and to find that perhaps the individual is lacking.  Tonight we are considering the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to head the Office of Management and This is a powerful organization, and it is a very important position. It plays a critical role in the oversight and management of our Federal budget. It plays a critical role in determining what gets funded and what doesn't get funded. So with that in mind, it is important that we have a robust debate about this position and about this nominee.  To break that down a little bit, the Office of Management and Budget puts together the budget for the In doing so, they take the vision our President has articulated, and they build it into a roadmap to accomplish that vision because where you spend money affects what actually happens as we pursue programs here in the United States of  It is the Director of the OMB who works to make sure the various pieces of the Federal Government are working together like gears that mesh cleanly together and do not conflict. It is the Director of the OMB who helps to determine the cost of proposed legislation, which can advance or doom any particular proposal. It is the position of the OMB Director to review the impact of proposed regulations, and that can also have a significant impact.  I come to this conversation with a number of concerns, and the first is the position of the nominee on Social For 82 years, Social Security has provided for the American people, and it has helped our Nation prosper.  On the third anniversary of the Social Security Act, in 1938, Franklin Roosevelt pointed out: ``Men and women too old and infirm to work either depended on those who had but little to share, or spent their remaining years within the walls of a poorhouse.''  That is not the vision we have today. Thanks to Social Security, our seniors have a basic income to see them through their golden years. They can live out their lives in relative comfort and security, rather than, as Franklin Roosevelt put it, ``within the walls of a poorhouse.''  In 2016, roughly 61 million Americans received over $900 billion in Social Security benefits. That is a huge injection into our economy, and it is spent almost immediately on fundamental goods. Nearly 9 out of 10 Americans older than 65 receive Social Security benefits, and for one-quarter of our Social Security beneficiaries, including both those who are single and those who are married, Social Security accounts for virtually their entire income. That would be many millions--more than 15 million Americans who would definitely be struggling in the most difficult fashion financially if Social Security didn't exist.  Retired workers and their dependents account for about 71 percent of the benefits paid. Funds also go to disabled workers. Disabled workers and their dependents account for about 16 percent of the benefits. Survivors of deceased workers account for another 13 percent or roughly one-eighth of the benefits paid.  Simply put, Social Security assists our retired workers, our disabled workers, and the survivors of our deceased workers. It is one of the best ideas America has ever put forward, but Congressman Mulvaney doesn't agree. He sees Social Security as a Ponzi scheme. Let me explain what a Ponzi scheme is. A Ponzi scheme is something where the incoming amount raised immediately pays for the benefits of somebody who paid in money previously.  We actually have a Social Security trust fund, which is the difference between Mick Mulvaney's description of Social Security and what we actually have. If we made no changes, no changes at all to increase the lifetime of the trust fund, it would continue to be able to pay 100 percent of the benefits through 2034 and roughly three-[[Page S1209]]quarters of all benefits currently promised ever after. That is if we make no changes.  If we make small changes, our Social Security trust fund is solvent for decades and decades into the future. Certainly, I think we should aspire to that vision of a trust fund that has a 75-year horizon, a full solvency.  The issue that Congressman Mulvaney raises, the idea he raises for changing how we adjust Social Security, however, isn't one of increasing the amount of wages that are subject to Social Security tax; it is not one of putting premiums on the income earned through nonwages, which is primarily income raised by wealthier Instead, it is to say to folks: Just retire later.  When you are a white-collar worker and you work in an office that is nicely air-conditioned and you have had full healthcare benefits throughout your entire life, maybe when you get into your sixties, you say, ``Well, maybe I could keep working a little longer,'' but the reality for a huge percentage of Americans who work difficult jobs, who work jobs where their bodies wear out, they don't have the choice of simply saying: I will retire in another 5 years, because they literally have developed so many issues and challenges that it is impossible to do the same kind of work they did in their twenties and their thirties in their sixties.  So that strategy of moving the goalpost on American workers, many of whom are decades already into the work they are doing, doesn't fulfill the promise and the vision of the Social Security  While Social Security is a great idea, moving the retirement age to age 70--which Mick Mulvaney advocates for, from his view as someone who comes from a job that perhaps isn't as arduous as many jobs in America--is a bad idea.  This vision continues on into Like Social Security, Medicare is also a generational promise, a lifeline for countless Americans since President Johnson signed it into law now more than five decades ago. Over 55 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health and their financial security. Roughly, 46 million are older Americans, 9 million are younger Americans with disabilities or certain illnesses.  While this program has worked incredibly well, our nominee wants to ``end Medicare as we know it.'' Those are ominous words for the 55 million Americans relying on He also believes we have to raise the retirement age.  He told Bloomberg News in 2011: ``You have to raise the retirement age, lower a payout, change the reimbursement system.''  The problem with raising the retirement age is the same problem we have with Social For American workers working hard in many types of jobs, their bodies are worn out. I used to have folks come to my townhalls and say: Senator, I am just trying to stay alive until I get to age 65, and they would tell me how they had multiple diseases and they were choosing between which disease to treat or how they had a single significant problem, but they were deciding to skip their pills every other day or cut their pills in half or perhaps go a week without their pills at all or how they were choosing not to go to the doctor when they developed a difficulty because they were afraid they wouldn't be able to afford the payment. That is not a healthcare system, but Mick Mulvaney wants to say to those folks: Oh, you reached age 65, too bad. I am providing this healthcare program another 5 years into the future. That is simply wrong, but more than wrong, it is also in direct contradiction to the promises made by President Trump during his campaign.  The contrast is incredibly stark between the President's promise to Americans that unlike so many of the folks in his party, he would not be the one to promote tearing down Medicare and Social He would not be the one to promote advancing the retirement age so people who are struggling have to struggle for another 5 years. So it is a poor fit between this individual and the office and the promises made to the American people.  Another concern I have is in regard to Congressman Mulvaney's advocacy for shutting down the economy. He seems very comfortable playing Russian roulette with our economy. He and a group of other House Members brought our government to a screeching halt in 2013 because they wanted to defund the Affordable Care What is the Affordable Care Act? The Affordable Care Act has enabled 20 million Americans to gain access to healthcare that they didn't have previously.  In my home State of Oregon, the Affordable Care Act has enabled about one-half million people to gain access to healthcare, both through expansion of Medicaid, known as the Oregon Health Plan, and also through the healthcare exchange and marketplace where you can compare one policy to another, shop for the policy that best fits your family, and those of modest means get credit to help pay for those policies so they can actually afford them. It is an affordable care plan that provides for a healthcare set of benefits--benefits such as the ability to keep your children on your policy through age 26, benefits such as not having an annual limit or a lifetime limit on your policy so that when you do get seriously ill, you don't run out of healthcare partway into treating your disease. It is the Affordable Care Act that ends gender discrimination in the insurance marketplaces. It is the Affordable Care Act that says if you have a preexisting condition, you can still get insurance.  I was at a fundraising walk for a woman who had a family member with multiple sclerosis. It was a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis. She said: Senator, this year is so different from last year. That was the year before the Affordable Care Act was implemented. I asked: How so? She said: A year ago, if your loved one was diagnosed with MS and they had insurance, you knew there was a good chance that your insurance was going to run out at the end of the year or they would hit a lifetime limit, and they wouldn't be able to pay for the care they needed. She said: If you didn't have insurance, you now have a preexisting condition that would prevent you from ever getting insurance.  She went on to say that the difference between last year and this year, because of the Affordable Care Act, is that now members in the MS community--those who had the disease and their family members who were supporting them all out at this fundraising walk--now knew their loved one would have the peace of mind that they would get the care they needed. This is what a healthcare system is all about, peace of mind, but Mick Mulvaney wanted to tear away that peace of mind. He proceeded to support a 16-day government shutdown that cost our country $24 billion--and to what purpose? To rip peace of mind away from 20 million  Back in 2015, he threatened to do it all again. The damage he had done--the $24 billion he had stolen from the American Treasury in the context of damaging the government with that shutdown--he was ready to do it all again in order to make sure Planned Parenthood never gets a dime from the government. To be clear, not a single dime from the government goes to Planned Parenthood for abortions. In fact, the organization that has done more to decrease abortions than any other in our country is Planned The government funds go for different purposes. They go to Planned Parenthood to do cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, prostate cancer screenings, and a whole host of fundamental basic healthcare. They are the healthcare provider for 2.5 million American women. Just as he was ready to recklessly shut down the government to rip healthcare away from 20 million Americans in 2013, he was ready to defund these essential healthcare clinics serving 2.5 million Americans in 2015. That is a sign of someone who has lost their policy foundations and is acting in an irresponsible and unacceptable manner.  Let's talk a little bit about the Consumer Financial Protection The CFPB was in response to a big problem in America, which was that we had no one looking out to shut down predatory financial practices. It was the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, but the Federal Reserve had their conversation on monetary policy up in the penthouse--the top level, if you will. That is what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve paid attention to.[[Page S1210]]They took the responsibility for consumer protection and put them down in the basement, and they locked the door and threw away the key.  Folks kept coming to the Federal Reserve saying: Hey, there is a major concern here. We have these predatory mortgages that have these teaser rates, and they are going to destroy the families who get those mortgages. They are going to destroy their dream of homeownership and turn it into a nightmare. People went to the Federal Reserve and said: By the way, we now have these wire loans, where there is no documentation of income and people are being sold these loans that they have no hope of repaying. In addition, we have another predatory practice called steering payments, which are kickbacks to originators. So they are getting kickbacks to steer people into subprime loans with high interest rates rather than prime loans that they qualify for. What happened? The Federal Reserve ignored all of that. That is the foundation for the collapse of our economy in 2008.  So along comes Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren, as an advocate, not yet a Senator, comes to this body and said: We need an agency whose mission is to look out and stop predatory financial practices, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we got it done.  What does Mick Mulvaney say about this effort to stop predatory financial practices? He says it is a ``sick, sad joke.'' So I asked him about this in committee. I said: Really? This is an agency that finally is watching out for working families so they are not prey to predatory, fraudulent practices. And he said: Yes, ``a sick, sad joke.''  I said: You know, they have returned funds to 27 million What other agency has fought for Americans in that fashion--returned funds to them from folks who were operating in a predatory fashion, to 27 million I didn't change his view by raising that.  I said: You know, this agency, to those 27 million people, has returned $12 billion. There was $12 billion returned to people who were cheated; isn't that a good thing? But I didn't persuade him.  He said: You know, I don't like the way this agency is set up. I want it to be a commission rather than an individual who heads it, and I want the funds to be appropriated annually by  I can tell you exactly why he wants those provisions, because that is the way Congress, at the behest of Wall Street, can step on the airhose that supplies the oxygen to They can stop the CFPB from functioning as a guardian, as a watchdog for consumers in America by simply defunding it.  We have a President who ran on the principle of taking on Wall Street, but Mick Mulvaney doesn't want to take on Wall He wants to do their bidding, to be able to shut down this agency that is finally fighting for financial fairness for working families. We have a President who said he is going to fight for working families. Mick Mulvaney should be backing the He should be expanding the He should be championing the CFPB, but, no, he wants to tear it down. That is deeply disturbing.  I see my colleague, the Senator from Hawaii, who is prepared to make remarks. I am going to wrap up my remarks.  There are more concerns that I have about the policy perspectives and how out of sync this nominee is with the promises the President made to fight for working Americans, the promises he made to take on Wall Street, the promises he made to protect Social Security, the promises he made to strengthen Medicare, not to tear it down. So for all these reasons, I find Mick Mulvaney is not the right person to fill this post, and I encourage my colleagues to vote against confirming him in this capacity.

When the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency proceeds to say we are to fight for the mercury standard, that means that fewer children will be exposed to a persistent neurotoxin that stunts the development of our children's brains. On the other hand, if that individual says: I am not concerned about that or I think I will just look the other way because I want to help the fossil fuel industry make a few more bucks, and he decides that weighs more heavily than the health of our children, then the health of our children is impacted. That is true with one form of pollutant and another, and they are just across the landscape. This is an incredibly important position. That is why understanding the viewpoints of the nominee is so critical.

My question to my colleague from Hawaii is as follows: Just the fact that a nominee, accepting a nomination and knowing the Senate has a responsibility to vet the nominee, who turns around and says, but you can't have access to my records, shouldn't that in itself disqualify that individual from consideration?

1026,topic-id,247,"Mr.President, in this conversation about these emails, the thing that keeps striking me is that our fundamental question is, Is the individual, is the nominee, given his record in Oklahoma, going to be an advocate for the environment, an advocate for the health of the citizens of the United States of America, an advocate for upholding clean water and clean air that have done so much to improve the quality of life for Americans, or is the individual, Scott Pruitt, going to be, instead, an advocate for the oil companies and the coal companies and the gas companies? That question goes to the heart of whether the individual, Scott Pruitt, is fit to carry this responsibility.  The American people have been very pleased with the enormous changes in the quality of the environment over the last 30 or 40 years, and it has added a tremendous amount of improvement to their lives. Here we have somebody who, possibly, is not going to advocate and fulfill the responsibilities of the office but who is going to use the office as director of the EPA as an extension of the complex matrix of fossil fuel companies and work on their behalf and not on the people's behalf.  I will invite my colleagues, if they have insight or questions related to this question of whether Scott Pruitt is going to serve the interests of the people or the interests of the fossil fuel companies, to feel free to weigh in.

1028,topic-id,513,"My colleague from Rhode Island put up the web. Maybe ``web'' is a better word than ``matrix'' because it looks like a giant spiderweb. What is being ensnared in this spiderweb, in this web of denial, in this ``denial beast'' as you have labeled it, is the truth.  What the complex group of organizations does is to put out information from every possible direction. They hold conferences; they hold workshops; they write letters to the editor; they write opinion editorials in our newspapers; they organize research--all so that it can reverberate in a way that an ordinary citizen hears from here and here and here the same lie--the lie that it is not clear whether carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is damaging our environment.  Here is the truth: We know very clearly the damage that is being done by burning fossil fuels, by burning natural gas, by burning coal, by burning oil, but there is so much money, so much profit, that they can build this enormous web of organizations to mislead the public, and that is half of it.  Then there is the second chart my colleague put up, which lays out these funds of dark money. This is really about the corruption of our democratic Maybe if I come over here, this will be in the same frame of reference. These funds flow through in a fashion that they contaminate the debate among citizens in election after election after election. This dark money is corrupting the very soul of our democracy--our elections.  Here is the interesting connection. Right now, a judge has ruled and said: ``There was an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested.'' Our nominee is in control of these emails, his own emails. He has been stopping access to them because he has that power as attorney general of Oklahoma because he is afraid of the information the public will learn from his communications.  The lines on the chart that my colleague from Rhode Island put up showed his connection to fund after fund after fund. In his communications with these groups, which may possibly be among the communications that the judge has just said will be released to the public, wouldn't it be interesting to find out what he said related to those organizations? Was he serving the public, or was he serving the fossil fuel industry?  This information will be available next Tuesday, but the majority leader has said, essentially, that he is willing to deny Americans the right to know the truth about Scott He is willing to deny Americans the right to know the truth about these emails.

1031,topic-id,1398,"Mr.President, I appreciate the questions from my colleague from As we stand here tonight, I think about how Hawaii is a State completely surrounded by water. It is very vulnerable to changes in the environment, very vulnerable to the introduction of invasive species, very vulnerable to changes in the acidity of the ocean, which is affected by carbon dioxide, and very vulnerable to the rising sea level.  I appreciate so much that as a citizen of Hawaii as well as now a leader for the voice of the State here in this Chamber, he keeps going back to his fundamentals of concern for our broader environment.  As you were asking this question, I was thinking about President Richard Nixon creating the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. He recognized that we all share ``a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to man.''  Well, that is a pretty clear statement that things were in trouble and we needed to operate a rescue. I think about that in the context of growing up in Oregon and, as I grew up, through my church and through my Boy Scout troop, we would go and do different projects to try to clean up messes that had been left. One of those was that we had a problem with these plastic six-pack rings that held all of the six cans together and the birds that were on the Pacific Flyway would stick their head through one of these plastic rings that would have held the top of a soda can, and they wouldn't be able to get it off, and they would end up choking or dying. Also, these plastic rings were being digested by the animals, and it was affecting them.  Then we had these flip-tops where you would open a can of soda by pulling off a triangular piece of metal and it would be a little hook that would sit on the beach or the pathway, and then somebody would step on it and cut their foot open or an animal would eat it, and this nice little curved object would tear up their throat and kill them. Those issues of: Why? Why do we have to operate with these consumer products in the fashion that are creating these specific hazards? The answer was: We didn't.  There was a bill in the Oregon legislature, and we eliminated the plastic rings that birds were sticking their heads through. And then we had a proposal--and I can't really recall if was done by initiative or by the legislature--to eliminate these flip-tops. The industry said: You cannot eliminate these flip-tops. People will not be able to open their cans of soda. It will be a terrible tragedy for There is no solution. You cannot touch this. Adamantly, they said: Nothing can be[[Page S1283]]done. It is an impossible problem to solve.  But we passed the law. We adopted that law, either by initiative or by the legislature, and a magical thing occurred. Within what seemed like a few days--maybe it was a few weeks--those peel-off flip-tops disappeared and were replaced by a different mechanism that opens that same triangle, but stays attached to the can.  Well, I have seen this time and again where there is a proposal where we need to improve our habits as humans, and as we are engaged in making our consumer products more complimentary to the environment, we are told: It can't be done. It will be too expensive. It will be too difficult. And then, when we say no, it can be done, and we pass a law, the solutions appear. And everyone says: Oh, that works just fine.  So now we don't have those plastic rings. Now we don't have those peel-off flip-tops that sit on the ground.  But we would go out in my Scout troop or in my church group and we would clean up and we would think that this would be so unnecessary to have these, and I saw the changes that occurred.  Then people said: What about all of these aluminum cans and glass bottles that are sitting all around here on the pathways around our Oregon had a strong ethic for the environment, but we were littered by all of these aluminum cans and steel cans back then, and also by glass bottles and broken glass bottles. If you have cleaned up a broken glass bottle, you know that it is real a pain to do that. And if you step on the shards from a glass bottle, you regret that somebody else shattered it and left it on the ground.  So we said: Why can't we change that? So the legislature put forward the idea and said: Let's just put a deposit on this so when you turn it in, you get 5 cents back. So we had the first bottle bill in the Nation, and that bottle bill got a huge percentage of those cans and those bottles returned that were left out in the public. And if somebody did leave something in the public space, somebody else would come along and say: There is a nickel; I will grab it and return it.  I must say that the amount of deposits in Oregon hasn't kept pace with inflation. When my kids were small, I would say: There is a bottle; grab it. There's a nickel. And they would say: It is just a nickel, A nickel isn't what it was three or four decades ago. But nonetheless, it still was an innovation that served as well.  About that same time, Oregon was worried about the developments of its beaches because we had a huge public trust with the beaches. The beaches belonged to all the people in the State, but the law was a little bit vague in this regard. But there was a provision that said that essentially public byways would remain public byways, and those beaches were established then by law in Oregon as belonging to all of the people of the State, and that access would be available to all of the people in the So nobody could take a piece of beach and say: This is mine. It belonged to everyone. So we gained our public beaches during that time period.  Then, someone else said: Well, look, we are seeing what is happening with congestion in some other And, with apologies to my fellow Senators from California, a lot of Oregonians turned to California and said: We are seeing a lot of sprawl, we are seeing a lot of congestion, and maybe we can do something about that and change the way that development occurs.  So under the governorship of Tom McCall, who, by the way, was a Republican and who, like Richard Nixon, believed in the environment--it was Richard Nixon who was President when we did the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, and we established the EPA, and it was the Republican Tom McCall who preserved the beach bill and the bottle bill and this land use planning bill that said: Let's put a boundary around each town and city, and you will not be able to build outside of that boundary so that we don't have sprawl. And some said: Well, we want to still have the right to build anything. So a compromise was struck. And it was that the tax rate outside of those boundaries would be much lower. So, with that, the farmers said: That is a sweet deal, we will take that. And the forest industry said: We will take that. Meanwhile, it meant that our city started to develop more densely with intense services, and we avoided the sprawl that had been experienced elsewhere.  I mention each of these issues--the bottle bill, the beach bill, the land use bill, the fact that we got rid of the flip-tops--because these were strategies to make us be able to operate in a more sustainable fashion, in accordance with the vision that Richard Nixon laid out when he created the Environmental Protection  Let me read that one more time. He said that we all share ``a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to man.''

1034,topic-id,406,"I appreciate that question. It is something we have witnessed unfold over the last two decades. It was not that long ago Republicans--both parties--for example, would stand up and say: We have a serious threat to our planet. That threat is the temperature of the planet is increasing, that we are suffering the impacts of methane and carbon dioxide pollution, and we must address that threat, but in the last few years, we have seen a steady diminishment of Republican commitment to address that threat. What does that correspond to? It corresponds very precisely to the[[Page S1284]]growth of dark money from the fossil fuel industry.  I hate to lay out this story because it is offensive to anyone--any patriotic American who wants to see government of, by, and for the people--to hear this story about the massive corruption of our body politic by this dark money.  If I go back a few years and look at a set of campaigns the last time I ran for office, that dark money became involved in Senate campaign after Senate campaign after Senate campaign after Senate campaign, and it very much had an impact on the composition of this body. As those races were won with dark money from the fossil fuel industry, the willingness of some individuals to stand up and speak truthfully, forthcomingly, and powerfully about the challenge to the environment diminished and diminished and diminished. That really has to change. It is why we have to take on this role of dark money. It is the factor that means there is no longer a Governor McCall--a Republican who is fighting for the beach fill, a Republican who is fighting for the bottle bill, a Republican who is fighting for the land use bill to make our environment work better.  As a kid, we had rivers in Oregon you couldn't swim in, and now you can. Now, they are not perfect. They still show a touch of humankind on them, but the point pollution--the pipes full of toxic materials that went in the river--those are gone. What we have left primarily is nonpoint pollution, which is a much harder thing to tackle, but even that we are working to control through buffers and a variety of regulations to try to clean that up. We have made big improvements.  That, to my colleague from Hawaii, I would have to say is the factor that has changed this body.

1037,topic-id,1046,"I appreciate the Senator's chart because I think it demonstrates, in a much more precise way, what I was describing, the corrupting role of dark money. Here, the Senate has illustrated how that money was really unleashed by the Citizens United decision and how the impact has been dramatic, just squelching the ability of my Republican colleagues to share this effort to create a sustainable planet.  I think, when we are asking for these emails to be reviewed before we vote, we are asking the question: Does Scott Pruitt share the mission that Richard Nixon stated when we created the Environmental Protection Agency? If you are going to head the Agency, do you share the mission? We want to know whether Scott Pruitt has, in Richard Nixon's words, ``a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment.'' We want to know whether Scott Pruitt has a profound commitment to the preservation of the Earth as a place habitable to mankind. We want to know whether he has a commitment to the preservation of the Earth as hospitable to mankind.  Henry David Thoreau kind of summed it up like this: What use is a house if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on? That is a good question. It is a commitment to the fact that where we live is just not the house, the structure of our bedroom and our kitchen and dining room, where we live is on this beautiful blue-green planet. That is our home, and we must care for it just as we do the structure of our house.  When I ask this question: Is Scott Pruitt committed to the mission of rescuing our natural environment, I think there will be answers to that in these emails. That is why we should see these emails, as the judge has said that we should see those emails. He said there was an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access. By whom? The person who blocked it was the attorney general of Oklahoma, who is the nominee whose record we are examining--the attorney general of The reason this body hasn't had these emails, the reason the American public has not been able to answer the question: Are you committed to the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency, is because Scott Pruitt prevented us from being able to answer that question.  He has been quite clear in other circumstances which amplify our concerns. On the Agency he has been nominated to lead, he describes himself as a ``leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.'' Just with those words, we sense a certain hostility to the work the EPA does to try to clean up the air, clean up the water, and hold polluters accountable. Isn't it a good thing to fulfill the mission you are charged with doing? It is not a pejorative. It is an important commitment to work hard to fulfill the responsibilities of the office.  That is one piece of evidence, but here is another. Devon Energy sent a letter to Scott Pruitt and said: Would you please make this the position of your office and address it to the Environmental Protection Agency, to the Honorable Lisa Jackson, head of the  Here is the letter as it was sent to Scott Pruitt by Devon Energy, saying: Won't you take our position as your position. Here is the letter that was sent on. This is the first page. There was a longer amount to it. As we can see, these paragraphs in yellow were lifted 100 percent over here into the letter. There was one sentence that was dropped out in the course of this lengthy letter. I think it is less than 5 percent of the letter was dropped out. Essentially, he took their letter and printed it on his stationery as the position of the attorney general on behalf of the people of the State of  So I asked him in the hearing whether he felt he was representing Devon Energy and making his office an extension of this corporation or whether he was serving the people of the He had earlier said he would like to hear from everyone and get all sides of something. He said: Well, I consider, in printing Devon's letter as Oklahoma's attorney general's letter, simply advocating for an industry that is important to Oklahoma--so making the oil position the position of the attorney general's office.  I said: Well, earlier you stated that you liked to hear the various sides of an issue and consider the input. Whom else did you talk to about this issue before you simply took the position of the oil company?  The answer was: No one.  So we can only conclude that, at least in this one instance, the nominee before us didn't look out to the people he was representing as attorney general. He didn't look after the body of law, the body of opinion, the body of effects. He didn't consult with anyone, except one organization--Devon  I must say, this is evidence, at this moment, of not serving the people, as an officer of the people is committed to do, but serving a company. So is this an anomaly or is this essentially the way he operated day in and day out? The answer is in the emails that we do not have. That is why it is a travesty if we vote tomorrow without getting those emails next Tuesday and enabling the public to examine them.  We normally have 30 hours of debate postcloture after we officially close debate. We don't quite close it but say there is another 30 hours of debate. That is what we are in right now, and that is why we are here tonight. Wouldn't it make sense to suspend this debate until after the citizens of the United States of America have a chance to pour through those emails and know the answer? Is this what we[[Page S1285]]can expect; that we will have an Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is serving Devon Energy and the Koch brothers and this dark money cartel or is he going to serve the citizens of the United States of America?

1040,topic-id,2375,"One of the things that I want to return to is why we are so concerned about this complex matrix of corruption, of dark money changing the outcome of campaigns, changing the makeup of the Senate, changing the type of rules that are adopted and the laws that are passed, because behind it all is a rising tide of pollution that is changing the chemistry of our air and changing the temperature of our planet.  This is a very simple chart here, and this shows temperature and carbon dioxide. If we look at this carefully, you can see that the carbon dioxide rises and the temperature rises. This is what has happened. The scientists have looked back hundreds of thousands of years. Carbon dioxide goes down, and the temperature goes down. Carbon dioxide goes up, and the temperature goes up because carbon dioxide is essentially a blanket.  If you increase the thickness of that blanket--that is, the density of the carbon dioxide--more heat is trapped on the Earth's surface. When we realize the age of the Earth, which is measured in billions of years, the time that we have been here in human civilization is pretty brief. And the time that we have been burning fossil fuels for energy is very brief--150 years--a very small blink of the eye.  In that time, we have changed the chemistry of the air. We have increased the size and the weight of the blanket substantially. Prior to the burning of coal, for many thousands of years, the carbon dioxide level had varied up and down, but the top level was 280 parts per million. That is this blue line.  What we see is that the carbon dioxide level has steadily climbed as we burn the coal, the natural gas, and the oil. As we have done that, the black line is going up and down. It has varied a little bit from year to year. It has steadily increased as well.  There are many folks who look at this and say that is just lines on a chart. If you project into the future, that is just a computer model. It can have different assumptions, and you can tweak that computer model. But this is a powerful, powerful explanation of facts on the ground that we are seeing every day.  Let's look at the facts on the ground. Let's set aside the computer models. Let's even set aside this chart showing temperature rising as the carbon dioxide levels rise.  What do we see in my home State of Oregon? What we see is that we have warmer winters, and those warmer winters mean that the pine beetles don't die off in the same way they do when there is a very cold winter. So they come out, and they attack more trees and more trees are killed. That is damaging to our forests. We see that effect.  What else do we see? We see a change in forest fires. Our forest fire season has grown enormously, by more than 2 months over about the last 40 years. Two months is a big additional portion of the year with fires raging, and the fires have been more intense. Partly, they are more intense simply because the forest is different.  The old-growth forests were more resistant to fire than the second-growth forests, and that is a result of our logging practices. In addition, there is the dryness of the forest. The forest is more dry. Sometimes the wood on the floor of the forest is as dry as a kiln-dried two-by-four. Then we have these weather patterns that involve more lightning, and there are more lightning strikes that are starting fires. So we have drier forests.  We have more lightning strikes. We have more dead trees, and we have more damage from these fires. We see a significant impact on our forest. How about on our farming? Farming depends on water. We have had three worst ever droughts in the Klamath Basin over the last decade and a half--three worst ever droughts. It had a huge impact on ranching in that basin and a huge impact on farming in that basin.  As we see that impact, we realize that on the frontline--on the very frontline--in the battle with rising temperatures is rural America, where we have industries that depend on our natural resources, on our forests, on our fishing, and on our farming.  Let's turn to our fishing for a moment. As the winters have gotten warmer, we have seen that in most winters--not in all but in most winters--the snowpack has been decreasing. What does that do? Partly, it affects farming because you have less water stored in the form of the snowpack, but it also affects the mountain streams. So you have warmer, smaller mountain streams for trout and for salmon.  For those who love to fish in Oregon--and so many people do love to[[Page S1286]]fish in Oregon; in fact, people come from many parts of the world to come and fish in Oregon--you now have streams that are less hospitable for that purpose.  Let's think about what is happening on the coast of On the coast, we are a Pacific Rim We have the vast Pacific Ponder this question. Is it possible that you could burn so much coal and so much oil and so much natural gas in 150 years that you could put so much carbon dioxide into the air, that the ocean could absorb a good share of that, and you could change the chemistry of the ocean?  I have to tell you this. Apologies to my colleague from This is the most beautiful coastline on the planet. You have these incredible mountains dashing into the ocean. You have these gorgeous Pacific waters. You have all kinds of wildlife, all kinds of fishing industry. The Oregon coast is one of the most spectacular places in the world. I must say that, in fairness, I have really enjoyed seeing the Hawaii coastline as well. It is different. It is beautiful and rugged in a different way, but spectacular.  There you are on the coast of Oregon, and you are looking out from those mountains that come crashing into the sea. We have capes--one cape after another. The cape is a big projection of land. You can stand on top of those capes, and you can see out to the horizon of the ocean. You can't see any land. You realize you can only see about 20 miles with the curvature of the Earth, but you know that the ocean goes on and on, far more than a thousand miles. And you say: That is a lot of water. That is an incredible amount of water on the planet It surely can't be possible that we have changed the basic chemistry of the ocean through the burning of carbon dioxide.  Then you talk to the marine biologists who measure what makes up the Pacific Ocean, and they tell you: You know what, the burning of coal and oil and natural gas is changing our ocean in a way that is making it less hospitable to life.  Here is what they are talking about. The ocean through wave action absorbs that carbon dioxide that we have been putting into the In fact, the carbon dioxide level in the air would be much, much higher if it weren't for the oceans pulling a good deal of it out. And then, in the water of the ocean, the carbon dioxide becomes carbonic acid.  When you hear the word ``acid,'' you say: Well, that doesn't sound very good. And you are right. That acid, then, has an impact on the ability of marine organisms to create shells. One specific example of this are the oysters on the Oregon coast. The oysters, as little babies, start to pull molecules out of the water and form shells. If the water is more acidic, it is much more difficult for them to do that, and the result is they die. They put all their energy into that effort. They can't do it. So they die.  In about 2008--the year I was running for office--we had this big die-off of baby oysters in the hatchery on the Oregon coast. It was a big scientific puzzle: What is causing this? What is the virus or the bacterium that is causing this?  The scientists got together, and with a lot of help from Oregon State University, the industry got together and they studied this, and they couldn't find that there was a virus causing this action. They started looking for a bacterium. Well, they looked. They didn't find that either.  What else could it be? It has to be one disease agent or another. It turned out that it wasn't a disease agent. It was the increasing acidity of the Pacific  Now, this morning, the owner of that hatchery happened to be coming through DC and came to my ``Good Morning Oregon'' reception. I hold this every Thursday morning that I am here. People can show up. We have a little bit of good Oregon coffee and a warm chance to reacquaint ourselves with old friends and to hear what folks who are visiting are thinking. He said to me this morning: Buffering is now continuous.  What did he mean by that? What he meant was, when they discovered it was the acidity that was killing the baby oysters, they had to start taking this seawater--they have a big pipe that pulls seawater up into the oyster hatchery, and they have another pipe that recirculates it back into the ocean. They had to start artificially reducing the acidity of the seawater so the baby oysters could thrive. What he said this morning is: We now have to buffer continuously. The condition has become so bad, it is bad on any given day. So that is where we are.  If the acidity of the ocean has changed from the burning of coal and oil and natural gas, isn't it time for us to wake up and pay attention? Isn't it time for us, as the stewards of the environment here in terms of making laws, to be paying attention? Shouldn't we be thinking again about those words that President Richard Nixon said when he created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970; that we all ``share a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment.''  How are we going to rescue our natural environment from the harm of burning fossil fuels if we keep burning fossil fuels? That is the question before us, and the answer is that we can't. We have to stop.  We have to, in a modest period of time, a rather short period of time--really, in the course of human civilization, just a microsecond of time--we have to move from burning fossil fuels to basing our economy on energy from clean and renewable sources. We have to do this very conscientiously. We have to do it through grassroots action. We have to do it through a framework that we create here at the national level. Both are powerful. Let's do both.  In the middle of that is the Environmental Protection That is why it is so important that we have a Director of the EPA who is committed to the vision of rescuing our natural environment, and that is why we need to have access to these thousands of emails before we vote in the U. I think that as we consider this, we need to ponder that the conditions we see in Oregon--that are derived from global warming, increasing temperatures--are not simply happening in my I used those examples because I come from I represent You can see these things right where I am, but you can look across our Nation, you can look across our planet, and see the effects everywhere.  If you take the 100 largest glaciers in the world and track their average retreat, it is dramatic. There are those, by the way, who say if you want to see a glacier at Glacier National Park, you better go soon because a number of glaciers in Glacier National Park have retreated substantially.  You can go to other parts of the country and see other impacts. For example, if you go to the Northeast, you have the challenge--just like the pine needles aren't being killed in the winter, the ticks aren't being killed, and the ticks are infesting the moose, and the moose are dying because you have these big clumps of ticks sucking the blood from the adults and from the babies. The list goes on.  Our colleague from Maine says: We are concerned about our lobsters. Our lobsters are migrating up the coast to find a temperature of water that used to be in Maine, and now they are moving north toward  You can talk to those who track insects, like certain types of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus, and their range is spreading. There is an insect called a sandfly that thrives in Central America, that is starting to show up in the United States of America because the temperature is changing, and that sandfly carries a disease called leishmania. This disease basically is extraordinarily difficult to cure, and it is a single-cell parasite. When you get bit by a sandfly, you get an enormous number, if it is an infected sandfly, of these parasites that start eating a hole either in your organs or in your skin--very difficult to cure.  As I describe this, I am just touching the surface. I haven't talked about the Great Barrier Reef, much of which has died over the last couple of years off Australia, and the list goes on and on.  So to close, we need a Director of the Environmental Protection Agency who has that profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment, and the preservation of the Earth as a place habitable by and hospitable to humankind.

We don't have all the facts we ought to have. That is because the nominee, in his role as attorney general of Oklahoma, worked very hard to keep the information contained, controlled, and unavailable to the Senators in this Chamber and unavailable to the citizens of the United States of  For 2 years now, his office has stonewalled attempts to make public the records of over 3,000 email communications with members of the fossil fuel industry. Two years ago, the Center for Media and Democracy requested these emails through the Oklahoma Open Records Who is the person who decides whether to release those records? The attorney general of Who is the nominee before us? The attorney general of  When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee requested these records from Mr.Pruitt during the confirmation process, the answer we got back was this: ``I would direct you to make a request of the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office under the Oklahoma Open Records Act.'' Now, when he encouraged us to make that request, he knew--and we shortly knew--that he had no intention of actually granting access. He was telling us to get in line behind more than 50 other requests for that information, and that request has not yet been answered. In fact, Senator Whitehouse did put in a request directly to the Oklahoma attorney general's office using the Oklahoma Open Records Imagine what the result was. Did the attorney general of Oklahoma immediately release these records? He did not. Have we those records today? We do not.  But yesterday, Oklahoma County District Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons ruled on whether or not the public deserves access to these emails and deserves access to these records, and she ordered the attorney general to do his job--to release the records so that we here in the Chamber will have that information, so that the American public will have that information. Judge Timmons said there was ``an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested.''  On Tuesday, the first batch of emails is going to be released to the public. That is just a few days from now. But if we vote today, we won't have that information before us. It will be too late for us to have all the facts and information we need to make a qualified decision on whether Mr.Pruitt is a fit character or unfit character to be a member of the President's That is exactly what the Founders of our Nation charged us with doing in the advice and consent responsibility--to determine whether a nominee is a fit character or unfit character.  So we here in the Senate are not doing our job. Under our responsibility under the Constitution, if we vote today, not having yet reviewed the information in those emails that the judge has just said must be released, we are being asked--or, more pointedly, forced--by the majority leader to rush through the confirmation of Mr.Pruitt without having this vital information.  This is a question of transparency. This is a question of exercising our authority in a responsible fashion. This is about the right of the Members of the Senate to have the information needed to fulfill their responsibility under the This is about the right of the citizens of the United States to know Members here are doing their job and to weigh in--to weigh in with us on what they consider to be fit character and unfit character. We should not deny Americans the right to know.

Mr.Madam President, over the past several weeks, we have seen a historic level of obstruction from our Democratic colleagues on the President's Let me say that again--truly historic, unprecedented, harmful, and pointless obstruction. It is one thing to obstruct to get some outcome. Really, these are a collection of futile gestures not changing the outcome on any of these nominations.

1153,topic-id,1026,"Madam President, when President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, he recognized that we all share in a ``profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to man.'' That is a pretty powerful commitment. That is the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency--to rescue our natural environment and keep our planet--our world, our Earth--as habitable and hospitable to humankind.  For more than 46 years, the Environmental Protection Agency has been the top cop on the beat, safeguarding our natural environment while also protecting critical aspects of public health--controlling toxic and poisonous chemicals, improving air and water quality, enhancing vehicle efficiency and emissions controls. The lists of the Environmental Protection Agency's accomplishments go on and on.  Today, we are considering President Trump's nominee for the Environmental Protection The appropriate question for us to ask is, Does this nominee hold in his heart the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency? Does he have a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment, a profound commitment to the preservation of the Earth to keep it habitable by humankind, hospitable to humankind?  This individual is Oklahoma Attorney General Scott We would like to have the full set of information about his work as attorney general that has been very relevant to this question, because the limited information we have shows that he has very deep connections and very close allegiance to the fossil fuel industry. And rather than displaying during his time as AG a profound commitment to our natural environment, to preserve it and keep it hospitable and habitable, he has instead weighed in time and time again on behalf of the polluters.  So for us to have a full sense of these connections, we need to have access to the emails and correspondence that he has generated over the last 2 years tied to the fossil fuel industry.  There are some 3,000 emails and associated pieces of correspondence--we are not sure of the exact total, but that is a substantial body of information that has been identified--and for 2 years, the attorney general, Scott Pruitt, has stonewalled the efforts to obtain these documents. There have been repeated requests time and time again filed with his office, and his office has failed to produce the information requested under the Public Information Act of Time and time again, he said no, no, no.  So then he comes to this body as a nominee to be the steward-in-chief of the responsibilities for our environment. So here in the Senate, we asked for those emails to help understand[[Page S1382]]whether he has served the public or whether he has served the polluters. That is the question before us. He said: Well, apply to the attorney general's office of Oklahoma for those emails and information.  This is rather unique. I don't know if this has ever happened in the history of the United States, the nominee saying: Yes, you can acquire that information by applying to me, back in my role as attorney general, knowing full well that he had absolutely no intention of actually providing that information.  Then yesterday a court stepped forward and said: Yes, this information must be provided. This is not the type of information that can be compiled overnight, so they gave Attorney General Scott Pruitt a couple of days--until next Tuesday--to be able to compile this information and provide it. And when it is provided, it will simply be the equivalent of PDF documents--scanned copies, if you will--of the printed copies of the emails and correspondence. Then it has to be shipped out to the group that applied for the information, and then they have to digitize it and send it out for us to have it here. It is still not searchable. Then we need time to go through it.  Well, it is convenient that we delay this vote until after we have this information because we are not going to be here next week. So whether we hold the vote at this moment, scheduled for 1 p.m., as we are leaving for a week or we hold it until when we return, on the Monday we return, it doesn't have any impact on slowing down this body. It would cost nothing in terms of the processing of the President's nominees to delay this vote until we return, at which time we will have the emails, and we will have had time to examine them, and the public will have had time to examine them, and that would honor our responsibility.  The Constitution was laid out in a fashion to put full responsibility on the individuals staffing the key agencies and Cabinet departments with the The Founders, the writers of the Constitution, wrestled with who should have that responsibility. They thought perhaps the appropriate check would be to have the Congress--they refer to it as ``Assembly'' in their dialogues--the Assembly decide who would be the folks staffing the executive branch at the highest levels of management. They said that was a problem because there wouldn't be full transparency. The public wouldn't be able to determine why one person was chosen or another person was chosen. There might be all kinds of trades taking place between the One might say: If you give me my choice for this Cabinet post, I will give you your choice for another, and the public wouldn't even know how those deals were being struck.  So the public accountability was honored by our Founders by saying the President will nominate, but in case the President goes off track and starts to nominate people of unfit character--unfit character--the Senate will have the responsibility to review the person's record and stop that nomination. That is our responsibility. That is the deterrence that Hamilton used, that we would take the process of this Chamber to ensure we do not confirm someone of unfit character. But to make that determination, we must have access to those emails, which are going to be distributed next  Madam President, I yield the floor to my colleague.  The PRESIDING The Democratic leader.

My State lost an individual who epitomizes all that it means to be a  Throughout his life, Ladd was dedicated to serving his family, his friends, his colleagues, and his hometown of Atchison.[[Page S1174]]  Atchison is along the Missouri River, the Kansas River, and right on the border with the neighboring They have a long history in that community, and he and his family have had a long opportunity, which they have taken advantage of, to benefit the citizens of that community. He fought a courageous fight with a terrible, progressive neurodegenerative disease, and he was laid to rest last week.  As a stalwart figure of Northeast Kansas who worked at MGP Ingredients for 40 years, he will long be remembered for his character and his leadership. Most everything good in Atchison involved Ladd and his family.  Ladd was not born a He was born in West Texas and graduated from Texas Tech University, where he met his wife Karen Cray during a national science fair put on by the U.Air Naturally, they both won first place awards at the fair, and later moved to Karen's hometown of Atchison, where they made their life and raised their family.  With a degree in chemical engineering and the mind of a true engineer, he had a passion for understanding the way things work on a mechanical level. His love of tinkering led him to a longtime hobby as an avid amateur radio operator.  Upon moving to Atchison, he began working at MGP as a distillery production manager. During his first 11 years there, Ladd rose to become the company's president and later CEO and, then, chairman of the board. He had an integral role in bringing the company public, when it became listed on Nasdaq's exchange.  Ladd and his beloved wife Karen, who now serves as MGP's board chairwoman, were blessed with two daughters and six grandchildren, who still live in Kansas today.  Beyond his leadership at the company MGP, where his intelligence and encouraging management style will long be remembered, Ladd contributed on numerous boards and to even more organizations that improve the lives of those who live in the community and around the To name but just a few, he was a founding member of the International Wheat Gluten Association, separately represented the U.grain community at the World Trade Organization meetings, and was a board member of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce and  He was also one of the original founders of the Atchison Area Economic Development Council, a longtime member of the Historical Society, and a former chairman of the Atchison Area Chamber of Commerce board.  Ladd's leadership was indispensable on the Amelia Earhart Memorial Bridge committee to construct a new bridge in 2012 across the Missouri River named for a fellow pilot and fellow Kansan, Amelia Earhart, one of our State's proudest daughters.  He cared deeply about education in his community, as evidenced by the recognition he and his wife received from Benedictine College, the Cross of the Order of Benedict, the institution's highest honor. His faith also played a significant role in his life, having served as an elder and deacon of the First Presbyterian Church of  One can hardly overstate what he meant to northeast Kansas, as Ladd always sought opportunities to serve his fellow He was a mentor to many and gave of himself to all who were fortunate enough to pass his way.

It is sad that Ladd was laid to rest, but may he rest in peace.                         Appropriations Process  Mr.President, there is a lot going on in the Senate, and I am grateful for that. I hope we can resolve our differences and begin to work on policy. Personnel do matter. But what I want to highlight, as we look at the agenda for the Senate, when we look at an agenda for this Congress and the Federal Government, is the appropriations process.  One of my goals as a Member of the Senate--I didn't expect this when I was elected; I didn't expect there to be a problem--what I want to see is the Senate function. All 100 U.Senators, whether they are Republican or Democratic, ought to take a great deal of responsibility for seeing that this place, the U.Senate, gives each Senator the opportunity to present his or her ideas, to represent his or her constituents, and to make a difference on their behalf. One of the ways we can do this is in the way that we appropriate money.  The appropriations process is important. At the moment, we are operating under a continuing resolution that expires in a few months. We have had lots of conversations about the first 200 days of this Congress, the first 100 or 200 days of the administration. We have talked about the importance of confirming Executive nominations. We have talked about the importance of dealing with the consequences of the Affordable Care We have talked about the need and the desire to repeal regulations that are onerous and damaging to our ability to create jobs. We certainly have talked about the need to do an overhaul in a comprehensive way of the U.Tax  I want to raise to my colleagues' attention and hopefully generate awareness about one of the things that seem to be missing in that discussion about what our agenda is or should be, which is the necessity of doing appropriations bills.  The way this place is supposed to work is that by law, by April 15, we are to have passed a budget, and then 12 separate appropriations bills march their way through the Appropriations Committee and come to the Senate floor, where they are available for amendment, discussion, and debate by every Member of the We ultimately pass each of those 12 appropriations bills and send them to the House or vice versa. Those 12 appropriations bills fill in the blanks.  Unfortunately, what has happened way too often is we have gotten in the habit of passing something we call a continuing resolution. Continuing resolution means that we are going to fund the Federal Government, its agencies and departments, at the same level of spending next year as we did this year. That suggests that there is no ability to prioritize how we should spend money. That is poor government. In fact, if you have had continuing resolutions year after year, the priorities of spending that were in place 2, 3, 4 years ago have become the priority of spending next year.  In my view, it would be a terrible mistake for us to reach the conclusion that we can do no better than a continuing resolution in the appropriations process this year that takes us to the end of the fiscal year. It is not just about priorities; we need to get spending under control. In fact, the appropriations process has generally done that. There is a reasonably flat line in the growth of government spending on the discretionary side, the things that the Appropriations Committee deals with, the things that we as Senators deal with on an annual basis.  In addition to determining priorities and levels of spending, another reason this is important is that it is our opportunity to influence decisions made by various agencies, departments, and bureaus of the Federal  In my view, the Constitution of the United States created the Congress--the congressional branch, the legislative branch--for reasons of trying to restrain Executive power. When we do a continuing resolution, we leave so much discretion, so much power in the executive branch. It doesn't matter whether it is a Republican President or a Democratic President, Congress is here to protect the American people from an ever-encroaching desire on any administration to garner more power and to make more influence in the Congress has the ability, if we will use that ability, to restrain Executive action. We are going through a series of Congressional Review Act procedures in which we are rejecting regulations made in the final days of the past administration.  A more effective long-term approach to dealing with the expansive nature of the bureaus, departments, and agencies is to have an appropriations process in which the agency head, the Cabinet Secretary, or the bureau chief knows that his or her relationship with Congress may determine how much money he or she has to spend within that agency. If we do a continuing resolution, there is little reason for an agency head, a Cabinet Secretary, or a bureau chief to pay attention to Congress, and that is contrary to the constitutional provisions giving us the responsibility to appropriate money, and[[Page S1175]]it continues the practice of an administration expanding their role in the lives of Americans and its businesses.  We need an appropriations process different from just a continuing resolution. We need to have the opportunity for agency heads to know that the appropriations process is going to matter to them. It causes them to have conversations and discussions with us, gives us the ability to tell an executive branch official: This doesn't work in my This is very damaging. This rule or regulation you are proposing is harmful. Can you go back and do it in a different way? Do you understand what this means in this circumstance?  Again, our leverage to have those conversations is often whether or not we are going to appropriate money and what that level of spending will be for that agency.  The other aspect of this is that in the absence of that dialogue and change of heart by that agency head, we then have the ability to say as a Congress that no money can be spent to implement this idea, this regulation, this rule.  While we focused attention--rightfully so--on the Congressional Review Act and its ability to limit and in this case repeal and reject regulations, the long-term ability to rein in any administration that exceeds its authority and operates in a way that develops regulations that lack common sense or an appreciation of how they might affect everyday Americans is through the appropriations process, and a continuing resolution will once again take away the constitutionally mandated, the constitutional responsibility we have in doing our jobs to protect the freedoms and liberties of the American people.  We have had a lot of conversations about what we are going to try to accomplish. One of the things that I want to make sure is on the agenda is, when the time comes, which is now, the conversation is--I hope the conversation is not ``Well, we have run out of time. We are just going to do another continuing resolution and fund the Federal Government for the next few months at the same level as we did last year.'' We need to exert our authorities to make sure the American people are out of harm's way from what government can do. The Constitution was created to protect Americans from an ever-expansive government, and it only works when Congress works.  The time is short. We hear that the administration is going to offer supplementals or amended requests for additional spending, especially in the defense arena. We need to get our appropriations work completed so that they have an opportunity to supplement, to make suggestions to Congress about what that appropriations bill should finally look like. We are close to failing in our responsibility to do that. Congress needs to do its work.  All 100 Members of the U.Senate can have their opportunity to have input in how money is spent. We can defend and protect the taxpayer; we can defend and protect the consumer; we can defend and protect the job creator; we can defend and protect the employee--but not if we don't do our work, not if we don't do appropriations bills and we rely once again on this technique of shrugging our shoulders, throwing our hands in the air, and saying that the best we can do is tell an agency that their spending authorities will be the same next year as they were last year.  We need to do our work. We need attention. The appropriations process should begin. And I ask my colleagues to give serious thought to helping accomplish that.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1170.txt,1507,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February

1144,topic-id,1478,"Madam President, the Natural Resources Conservation Service is one of the best opportunities we have--and some of the best stewards we have for caring for lands in Kansas are our farmers and ranchers. What a great combination in the public-private partnership when we work together to improve our water quality and quantity, work to make sure our air is cleaner, make certain, as best we can, that the dust doesn't blow in  While we talk about environmental issues, I want to mention the work that goes on in my home State and places across the country with a partnership that occurs by the Department of Agriculture--USDA--its agency, the NRCS, and landowners in my  I want to highlight the circumstances those farmers and ranchers find themselves in today. In 2016, the price of wheat hit a decade low. Wheat prices fell from a high of $7.60 a bushel in 2013 to $4.11 per bushel in 2016, from $7.60 to $4.11 in just a short period of time.  Unfortunately, those prices have continued to stay low. Often in Kansas, when commodity prices are a challenge for those who raise crops, we are able to supplement our income by the price of cattle--our ability to raise quality beef and to sell that in markets and to compensate for the challenges that occur on the crop side of agriculture.  Unfortunately, the same thing has happened in the livestock market as well. Live cattle prices dropped from $166 per hundredweight in January of 2015 to $132 per hundredweight in January of 2016; again, a fall from $166 to $132.  Those things combined, low commodity prices, low price for wheat, low prices for cattle, mean that agriculture in rural America is hurting greatly. This is a tremendous challenge and appearing to be perhaps the most difficult time that agriculture producers, farmers, and ranchers face in the Midwest since the thirties.  I have come to speak about this today. Senator Roberts, the chairman who chairs the Agriculture Committee, is having a hearing of the Agriculture Committee in Kansas during the next few days. I appreciate the opportunity he is providing Kansans to have input as the process begins for a new farm bill. I congratulate him and welcome the input that everyday folks who earn a living in agriculture will have as a result of his efforts.  What I want to highlight today is that with the circumstances so challenging, we need to do things that reduce the input cost associated with production agriculture. But the focus I want to make today is that we need every market possible for our farmers and ranchers to sell into. Ninety-five percent of the mouths to feed, 95 percent of the consumers are outside the United States, and our ability to survive in agriculture in Kansas and this country is related to our ability to export those agriculture commodities, as well as food products, around the globe.  In the confirmation hearings that I have been involved in based upon my committee assignments and in addition to conversations with the nominee to be the Secretary of Agriculture, Governor Perdue, I have highlighted time and time again the importance of exports.  If we face this struggle--a struggle we do absolutely face today--a way we can help improve that circumstance is to sell more grains, more meat products, more beef, more pork into foreign country markets. It is not happening the way it needs to happen to lift the prices and therefore increase the chances that farmers and ranchers will survive the difficult and challenging economic circumstances.  I almost said ``as an aside.'' Let me mention another challenge. It really isn't an aside, it is so important. We have difficult times in agriculture. It is a cyclical world, and prices are up and prices are down based upon the laws of supply and demand. But in difficult times, we have always in the past been able to count upon a lender, a banker who is willing to help that farmer, that rancher get through difficult times.  The regulatory environment our bankers now face, particularly in rural communities where there is a relationship--we often operate in banks in my State, and certainly in rural communities across Kansas, as a result of a relationship. So our bankers--those who lend money to farmers--know those farmers. They know their families. They know their parents, their grandparents. They were the financier. They were the ones able to lend working capital to farmers in good times and bad.  Our regulators and I have visited with the Officer of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the state banking commissioner in our State, all with the message that in these difficult times, we can't let the consequences of Dodd-Frank overwhelm the ability for a banker to continue to make decisions about lending money to agriculture producers. We can't let the authority of making that decision, based upon long generations of relationships between those in agriculture and those in financing agriculture, be overcome by the rules and regulations that followed the passage of Dodd-Frank, particularly as it relates to those relationships with community banks and lenders.  So while it is challenging in agriculture due to the prices, one of the reasons we have been able to survive over the years in low-price times is because of that relationship and understanding.  I know this farm family--this is the banker talking--I know this farm family, and I have lent money to them for a long time. I lent money to their father or their grandfather, their mother[[Page S1375]]or their grandmother. They have the integrity, the character, and the ability to repay.  If the lending in rural America becomes nothing more than a computer program in which you punch in the numbers and character becomes something that is irrelevant--there is not a computer program to measure character. If we lose the opportunity for a relationship developed between a lender and a farmer, we lose the ability to make things work in difficult times. Those times are with us.  The primary point I would like to make today is that we need exports and we need them now. And while there is always a debate about the value of a particular trade agreement--and that debate is useful--we ought never lose sight that there is no real debate about the value of exports. So we need to put in place the mechanisms that allow farmers and ranchers and others in my State to be able to export a product around the globe.  I would encourage the administration and I would encourage Members of Congress, as we develop our policies in this new session, to make certain that exports are front and center in our economic policy because the survival of the folks I represent in Kansas and the communities in which they live is in jeopardy if we don't get those markets back and if we don't retain those markets.  Exports are important to us. We can't afford not to pursue each and every one of them. If we are not going to have multilateral trade agreements, we need to have bilateral trade agreements, and we can't wait very long for those agreements to take place.  Again, 95 percent of the consumers live outside the United States, and our ability in Kansas to have a bright future is determined by the ability to connect with those consumers outside the United  If I can take just one more moment to also point out that I have requested USAID and the Department of Agriculture in our food and hunger programs around the globe to increase the role that wheat and other commodities play in feeding a hungry world. We want to sell commodities in the export market, but as we develop our programs to combat hunger, we can get something that is very noble and something very valuable--helping people around the globe be able to go to bed with a full stomach is a desirable and noble goal, and the utilization of an increasing amount of agriculture or commodities grown in the United States in that effort would benefit farmers in our country, as well. It is the proverbial win/win. The noble accomplishment of helping people fight back food insecurity and at the same time creating an additional opportunity for the export of wheat, for example, which, because of significant amounts of harvest, is in an overabundant supply--is in abundant supply here in the United  Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to visit with my colleagues here on the Senate floor today and to express the desire to work with each of them as we develop the efforts to make certain that exports are front and center, particularly as they relate to agricultural interest of the United  Madam President, I yield my time.

1492,topic-id,1693,"Mr.President, I am here on the floor tonight to speak about our Nation's efforts to end global hunger. It is an undertaking that countless individuals, foundations, and government agencies have devoted a significant amount of time, resources, and effort attempting to solve.  Those who have dedicated their lives to feeding the hungry deserve our deepest gratitude and respect. They made the decision to improve the lives of others less fortunate than themselves, and they often have done that at their own loss of comfort and their own well-being. There is no nobler a calling than trying to do something for someone else, especially when it costs you something as well.  Regardless of our faith, our creed, or our religion, almost all of us are taught early in life that it is our duty to help those in need. Americans consistently have taken that moral responsibility to heart. As individuals, we help our neighbors through our churches and other local organizations. We help feed our hometowns. As a country, we lead the world in providing food aid to millions of people who are in need of that assistance.  In 1983, at a signing of a World Food Day proclamation, President Reagan cited 450 million people in developing countries who were undernourished. Our global population has risen by 3 billion people since that time, and today there are nearly 800 million undernourished people in the world who do not have enough food to lead healthy, normal lives.  While strides are being made in the fight against food insecurity, it is clear that our commitment cannot waiver, and ending hunger must remain a priority.  At that same White House ceremony, President Reagan chided the Soviet Union for failing to provide humanitarian relief to those in need. President Reagan offered a direct challenge to the Kremlin to explain why the Soviet Union only provided weapons but not food assistance to the underdeveloped world.  While the threats in the world today are different than those faced during the Cold War, American food assistance remains a powerful foreign policy tool. American food aid elevates our country's moral standing and leadership in the world, as realized by President Reagan, but our efforts to reduce food insecurity also serve our own national interests by promoting political, economic, and social stability in the world.  Food-related hardships and hunger--either due to price increases or food shortages--act as a catalyst for protests and armed conflicts. We have witnessed regions of the world that are critical to America's strategic interests descend into chaos due to people not having access to affordable food.  From 2007 to 2011, spikes in global food prices led to increased food insecurity and unrest in the world. In the Middle East and North Africa, food-related challenges were one of the major drivers of the mass uprising that we call the Arab  In Syria, Islamic State rebels use the promise of food and basic necessities to recruit soldiers. Food shortages have led refugees to leave camps and return to an active war zone in search of food for themselves and their families.  Closer to home, food prices contributed to rioting in Haiti in 2007 and 2008. As food prices increased and economic conditions deteriorated, U.Coast Guard interceptions of people from Haiti attempting to immigrate to our country rose by 20 percent, straining Coast Guard resources.  The National Intelligence Council warns that a continuation of the fundamental contributors to food insecurity--such as expanding populations, slowing of agricultural yields, and gaps in infrastructure and distribution systems--will result in increased food insecurity, hunger, and instability in the[[Page S1437]]Middle East, Africa, and South Asia over the next 10 years without greater, greater intervention by the United States and others.  In America, we take our food system for granted. Americans spend less than 10 percent of our disposable income on food. Even though less than 2 percent of our country is directly engaged in farming, Americans have direct access to the safest, most affordable, and highest quality food in the world.  I am proud of the wheat farmers and the ranchers in my home State of Agriculture production is a noble calling. Feeding the world is important and a meaningful way to spend one's life, and Kansas families have done it for generations.  Our country's food system at home is critical to our own security and well-being, and helping other countries achieve food security and stability serves our national interests as well.  Utilizing U.S.-grown commodities in food aid programs also benefits American farmers and ranchers by creating export markets for our agricultural products, sometimes reducing an excess of supply.  Almost 10 percent of exports of the hard red winter wheat grown in Kansas in 2016 was utilized by international food programs, representing a significant market share for wheat grown in our Today's low commodity prices only serve to highlight the need for ag export markets for producers.  A few months ago, I called on the U.Agency for International Development and the Department of Agriculture to significantly increase the amount of wheat in our global food aid programs.  Our country's abundance of food imparts a moral duty to provide humanitarian relief to those in need. We have witnessed great unsettlement and mass migration in the world due to political instability and civil wars. The vast majority of people affected, including displaced refugees whose lives were uprooted and whose ability to feed themselves was taken away, are suffering through no fault of their own.  In other parts of the world, people are born into such poverty that simply finding sufficient food is a daily challenge. Reading recent articles, the question has often been: Where am I going to find food to feed my family?  People in Cambodia indicate they have no idea. It is a day-to-day, moment-to-moment, meal-to-meal experience. Even if that food is available, it is often not accessible to people without the means to pay for it.  Many of these people--weary, desolate, and hungry--survive only because of the generosity of the American people. Those hungry and less fortunate depend on a nation with moral strength and clarity to give them a helping hand.  There is still more work to be done in the fight against hunger, and America ought to continue to rise to the challenge of providing food and helping people feed themselves throughout the world.  It is a turbulent world stricken with conflict, and sometimes the hunger and problem seem so great that it would be easy just to walk away and say it is too big of a problem to solve. But certainly we have the ability.  We have the means to feed one person. If we can feed one, why not two? And if we can all feed two, why not three?  We can't simply look at this challenge as being too big to overcome and that the world will always have hungry people and then just say: We have no responsibility to respond.  Food aid provided by the U.reduces despair and increases stability. My point is that it has a moral component. It is the right thing to do, but it is also beneficial to our own Nation, providing stability around the globe and increasing our own national security.  The importance of these issues motivated me when I was in the House to chair the House Hunger Caucus, and now I cochair the Senate Hunger I can't remember what year it was, but I had a midlife crisis. I have probably had several since then. But my thoughts were at that point in time, back in my House days, that at least then I thought of myself as a pretty good Member of I answered the mail. I met with constituents. I visited my State on a weekend-by-weekend basis. I had input. I did the things that a good Member of Congress is supposed to do. I represented my constituents well.  But we all can do something more than just be a good Member of Congress, and that was my conclusion. If there is an issue that we want to champion, if there is an issue on which we want to make a difference, if there is a moral cause we want to rise to the occasion to support, hunger, particularly for Congressman--now a Senator--from Kansas, ought to be a place I put my stake in the ground and go to work.  I suppose I have taken a few months off of this issue--and maybe I am having another midlife crisis--but it is time for me to reengage and to engage effectively as best I can to see that we live up to a moral commitment that also benefits our own country.  So I now cochair the Senate Hunger I have since I came to the I serve with a number of my colleagues, including the one who is on the floor tonight, the Senator from I ask my colleagues to join us in the effort to meet the needs of a hungry world, to take the step to see that one more person is fed, one more family has less insecurity, one more mother or father no longer worries about whether their children are going to go to bed hungry.  Former Kansas Senator Bob Dole has set many standards in the way that he led his life, which we should all aspire to meet, not the least of which is his unwavering commitment to ending hunger. Those of us in this Senate today ought to seek to carry on Senator Dole's legacy. I would encourage my colleagues to join me and others as we work to put the Senate Hunger Caucus together, to enhance its ability to address the issues that we face in the real world to fight hunger.  I am committed to reengaging these efforts. Along with the other caucus cochairs--Senators Boozman, Casey, Durbin, and Brown--I would extend an invitation to each of my colleagues to join that caucus so that we can take the small step of fighting hunger by becoming more knowledgeable, more aware and engaging in the moral and strategic battle to end hunger around the globe.

1717,topic-id,1831,"Mr.President, we have the nomination of Representative Ryan Zinke to be the Secretary of the Interior as the business before the body today, and I wish to spend a few moments this afternoon speaking about him, his qualifications, and why I believe he will be a strong Secretary of the  Of all the Cabinet-level nominations that have an impact on my home State of Alaska, the Secretary of the Interior is almost certainly the most important and the most consequential. Two-[[Page S1472]]thirds of Alaska--nearly 224 million acres--is under Federal management. To put that into perspective, that is more land than is occupied by the entire State of Texas, and it is an area about 177 times larger than the State of The vast majority of that land is controlled by agencies within the Department of the Interior, from the Bureau of Land Management, to the National Park Service, to the Fish and Wildlife Again, significant parts of Alaska--more land than is occupied by the State of Texas--are held under Federal management. It is for this reason we in Alaska call the Interior Secretary our ``landlord.'' He might not necessarily like that fact, but that is what he is effectively.  While it might sound strange if you are from an Eastern State such as Massachusetts or New York, which have hardly any Federal lands within their borders, the decisions that are made by the Department of the Interior literally determine the livelihoods of thousands of Alaskans, as well as the stability and the success of our When the Department of the Interior chooses to work with us, Alaska is able to grow and prosper, even as our lands and our waters remain protected under the most stringent environmental standards in the world. When the Department chooses not to work with us, as was all too often the case in the last administration, the people of Alaska suffered. Our State's economy, our budget, and our future are all threatened at the same time. I start with that context to help the Senate understand why I take this confirmation process so seriously whenever a new Interior Secretary is nominated.  I consider whether the nominee is right for the job and whether he or she will do right by the people of Alaska, as well as other western states. I talk with the nominee and ask him or her questions about everything from ANCSA and ANILCA to wilderness and wildlife management. When I make a decision, I am making it as a Senator for Alaska and as the chairman of both the authorizing committee and the Appropriations subcommittee for the Department of  Today, after a great deal of review and careful consideration, I am very pleased to be here to speak in strong support of our new President's nominee for this position, Representative Ryan I believe Representative Zinke is an excellent choice to be our next Secretary of the Maybe I am a little bit partial here, but the fact that he is a fellow westerner, hailing from the Treasure State of Montana--that helps with my decision. He is a lifelong sportsman. He loves to hunt and fish. That also resonates with me. I also understand he is a pretty good downhill skier, and I like that too. He is a trained geologist. He has worked as an energy consultant. Even more notably, he has dedicated his life to the service of our Nation, including more than two decades as a Navy SEAL, a term in the Montana Senate, and most recently as the sole U.Congressman for his home  Representative Zinke's life and career have prepared him well to serve as Secretary of the He was born in the He lives in the He understands it. He understands its people. He has substantive knowledge of the challenges facing the Department and truly a firsthand experience in trying to solve them. He has also shown that he understands the need for the Department to be a partner for Alaska and other western states, which contain the vast majority of our nation's Federal lands.  We had an opportunity in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a hearing to consider Representative Zinke's nomination on January 17. It seems like an eternity ago now, but what I remember very clearly from that morning is the positive and very compelling vision he shared with us.  Representative Zinke told us he grew up in a ``small timber and railroad town next to Glacier National Park.'' He explained that he believes the Secretary is responsible for being ``the steward of majestic public lands, the champion of our great Indian nations, and the manager and voice of our diverse wildlife.'' He did show us--and spoke to it in the committee hearing--that he understands the purpose and the value of Federal lands, invoking Teddy Roosevelt and pledging to follow the multiple-use doctrine.  As other colleagues have come to the floor today to speak about Representative Zinke's nomination, several have spoken to the issue of the Antiquities Act, speaking more directly than to the issue of multiple-use as it relates to our public lands. Yet, in outlining the concept of multiple-use that Representative Zinke believes and follows, it is probably best to look to his own words that he said when he was before us in the committee. On multiple-use, Representative Zinke said the following:       In multiple-use, in the spirit of Roosevelt, it means you      can use it for multiple purposes. I am particularly concerned      about public access. I am a hunter, a fisherman. But multiple      uses are also making sure what you're going to do, you know,      and you go in with both eyes open, that means sustainability.      That means that it doesn't have to be in conflict if you have      recreation over mining.       You just have to make sure that you understand what the      consequences of each of those uses are. It's our public land.      What I have seen most recently is our access is being shut      off, roads are being shut off, and we're all getting older.      And when you don't have access to hunting areas, traditional      fishing areas, it makes it an elite sport.       And I'm particularly concerned about the elitism of our      traditional hunting, fishing, and snowmobiling. Making our      public lands accessible in the spirit of multiple-use. Single      use, if you look at the Muir model of some of our national      parks and some of our areas, I agree. There are some areas      that need to be set aside that are absolutely appropriate for      man to be an observer.       There are special places in our country that deserve that      recognition. But a lot of it is traditional uses of what we      find in North Dakota and Montana where you can hunt and      fish, you can drill an oil well. Make sure there is a      reclamation project. Make sure there is a permit, make      sure there's If you are doing something that's more      intrusive, make sure you monitor the water. Everyone      enjoys clean water and we should. I don't think      necessarily they are in conflict. I think you have to do      it right.  I think it is important to put those comments of Representative Zinke on the record because it is clear that, again, he recognizes the multiple uses of our public lands--recognizing there are certain places that are special but ensuring, again, that the doctrine of multiple-use is respected as initially intended.  Representative Zinke also told us that he would have three main tasks if he is confirmed as Secretary of the The first, he said, is to ``restore trust by working with rather than against local communities and states.'' The second is to address the multibillion dollar maintenance backlog at the National Park Service so that we preserve the crown jewels of our public lands for future generations. And the third is to ``ensure the professionals on the front line, our rangers and field managers, have the right tools, right resources, and flexibility to make the right decisions that give a voice to the people they serve.''  So those were the three priorities as outlined by Representative Zinke, and I believe all three of those missions are necessary. I am hardly alone in supporting Representative Zinke as the right choice to fulfill them. Within the committee, he drew bipartisan support when we reported his nomination to the full Senate on January 31. He has drawn widespread support from dozens and dozens of stakeholder groups all across the country: from the Alaska Federation of Natives, the Blackfeet Tribe, the Choctaw Nation, the National Congress of American Indians, Safari Club International, Ducks Unlimited, the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, the National Rifle Association, the Public Lands Council, and the American Exploration & Mining These are just a few of the many stakeholders that have praised or endorsed Representative Zinke to be our next Secretary of the  I am glad we are finally here today on the verge of confirming Representative Zinke to this position. I would remind the Senate that despite many substantive differences, we confirmed President Obama's first nominee for Interior Secretary on inauguration day back in 2009--not so with Representative It has now been 6 weeks since we held his nomination hearing and almost a full month since we reported his nomination from our committee--again on a strong bipartisan basis. I am disappointed, of course, that it has taken this long to get to this point, particularly with regard to a nominee who I think, by all accounts, is not controversial or unqualified.  Now we need to confirm Representative Zinke without any further delay,[[Page S1473]]so that he can select his team and get to work addressing the range of issues that he will inherit. From the maintenance backlog of the Nation Park Service, to the need for greater balance in Federal land management, to life-and-death issues in remote Alaska communities, and from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to U.S.-affiliated islands, Representative Zinke really has his work cut out for him, and he needs to be allowed to get started as soon as he can.  Again, I will repeat that I believe Representative Zinke is a solid choice for this demanding and critical position. While we may not agree on every issue, I believe he will work with us in a thoughtful manner that is reflective of a true partnership. I believe he understands what the job requires, he has the experience necessary to succeed in it, and he will show that the Department of the Interior can still work with local stakeholders to achieve positive results.  I thank Representative Zinke for his willingness to continue his service to our Nation and for his patience during this process. On behalf of Alaskans, I look forward to working with him after he is confirmed with bipartisan support, and I urge every Member of the Senate to support his nomination.  With that, I see the other Senator from the great State of Alaska is here with us today.  I yield the floor.

221,topic-id,2074,"Mr.President, I have heard my Republican friends tell those[[Page S1147]]of us who want the laws of this country changed to protect our constituents against gun violence that what we should focus on is enforcing the existing law; that we don't need any new laws, all we need to do is focus on enforcing the existing law.  Senator Wyden said he wished he had a nickel for every time he has been told our focus should be on background checks. Well, I wish I had a nickel for every time my colleagues told me we should focus on enforcing the existing law. Yet I would also be a rich man if I had a nickel for every time Republicans came to the floor and tried to undermine the existing law, tried to rewrite the existing law to make it harder to enforce it.  The Appropriations Act is, on an annual basis, loaded up with riders that hamstring enforcement agencies, don't allow them to actually enforce existing laws. The CRA we have before us today will make it harder for the Federal Government to do what we have told them to do for decades, which is to put dangerous people and people who are seriously mentally ill on the list of those who are prohibited from buying guns. That is the existing law. The existing law says that if you are convicted of a serious crime or you have a serious mental illness and you have gone through a process by which a determination has been made by a government agency as such, that you should not be able to buy a weapon.  Why do we have that law on the books? Why have we come together as Republicans and Democrats to say that people with serious mental illness or people who have been adjudicated of a violent crime shouldn't be able to buy weapons? It is because the evidence tells us over and over again that if you have committed a violent crime, you are likely--more likely than if you haven't committed a violent crime--to commit another one. And over and over again, as we have seen these mass shooters walk into places like Sandy Hook Elementary School or a movie theater in Colorado or a classroom in Blacksburg, we know that people with serious mental illness in this country can go buy a very powerful weapon and do great damage with it.  That does not mean there is an inherent connection between mental illness and violence. In fact, we know the opposite to be true. If you are mentally ill, you are probably more likely to be the victim of violence than you are to be the perpetrator of it. But we do know that in this country, given the fact that weapons are so easy to come by, people with mental illness--serious mental illness--who have an intersection with visions of violence often do great harm. So we made a collective decision as Republicans and Democrats that if you have a serious mental illness, you probably shouldn't be able to go and buy an assault weapon. That is what the law says.  Section 101 of the NICS Improvement Act is titled ``Enhancement of requirement that Federal departments and agencies provide relevant information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.'' That is a piece of legislation which both Republicans and Democrats supported. It commands that Federal agencies provide relevant information to the criminal background check system.  What is relevant information? ATF defines someone who should not be able to buy a gun as one who ``lacks the mental capacity to manage his own affairs.'' So there is the existing statute. The existing statute says that relevant agencies should forward information to the criminal background check system on individuals who are prohibited from owning guns, and that is defined in part as an individual who ``lacks the mental capacity to manage his own affairs.''  That is exactly what the regulation proffered by the Obama administration at the end of last year does. It says that individuals who have filed a claim for disability, who meet the requirements of one of Social Security's mental disorders listing of impairments, have been found to be so severely impaired that they are unable to work, and have been found, with due process, to be incapable of managing their own benefits and have had a representative appointed to them to manage their disability benefits, that those individuals meet the definition of someone who lacks the mental capacity to manage their own affairs.  If you are supporting this CRA today, then you are undermining the ability of law enforcement to do their job to enforce the law as Congress has passed. So spare me this rhetoric about passing no new laws because we should just focus on enforcement. Once again, with this CRA, you are undermining the ability of the Federal Government and of law enforcement to enforce the law.  Let's be clear about what the danger is. It is correct to state that there is no inherent connection between being mentally ill and being dangerous, but the risk is not just that an individual is going to buy a gun and use it themselves; the risk is that someone who literally can't deposit their own paycheck probably can't or likely can't responsibly own and protect a gun.  I could sit here for the rest of the day and recite the number of times a gun owned by one individual got used in an accidental shooting, got taken illegally, stolen from their premises, and used in a crime. The danger of an individual who has severe mental incapacity is not just that they are going to take that weapon and fire it but that they are not going to own, keep, and protect it responsibly. If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you are going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm?  We are talking about a very limited group of individuals here--who, by the way, under the regulation, have due process to contest the determination. First of all, they have an ability to contest the determination by Social Security that they shouldn't be able to manage their own financial affairs, and then the regulation secondarily gives them the ability to specifically contest their limitation on gun ownership. So there is full ability for the individual or for the family to contest this limitation, which makes it completely constitutional. Nonsense that this is a restriction of a constitutional right.  The Heller decision, which does hold that an individual has a right to gun ownership, also makes it explicit in Justice Scalia's opinion that there are limitations on that right, and the Scalia decision itself lists as one of those conditions the restriction of gun ownership by people who are seriously mentally ill.  The law is clear that Federal agencies are required to upload information onto NICS of those individuals who cannot manage their own financial affairs because of mental illness. The Supreme Court is clear that this is entirely constitutional. So why are we doing this? Why are we having a debate about rolling back the criminal background check system when 90 percent of Americans support it?  No matter what State you live in, sit down with your constituents and tell them that you voted to allow people who are seriously mentally ill to be able to buy guns. You are not going to get a lot of takers. And it is not because people don't have compassion for people with mental illness. I have worked for the last 2 years to pass the most substantial mental health reform act that this body has seen in a decade. I have spent as much or more time than anybody in this Chamber advocating for the rights of people with mental illness and for their treatment. But I also understand that when people are so mentally ill that they can't manage their own financial affairs, they probably shouldn't buy a gun. That is a small class of people.  What makes me so angry about this is I have no idea how to go back to the people whom I represent in Connecticut and tell them that in the 4 years since the massacre in a smalltown elementary school, not only has Congress passed no law, made no change in statute to try to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of would-be shooters, but that today we are doing exactly the opposite. The response to the epidemic of mass shootings in this country is to make it easier for people with serious mental illness to get guns. How do I explain that to people in Connecticut?  How do the folks representing areas where shootings are a regular occurrence explain that Congress has done nothing to address mass shootings, to address the epidemic rates of gun violence in our cities, and yet we think it is so important to undermine the criminal background check system--not strengthen it, undermine it--that in the first month of this new administration and this new Congress, we are[[Page S1148]]rushing through this repeal of a commonsense regulation? That is deeply offensive to the majority of Americans, who think we should be strengthening our criminal background checks system, not undermining it. Ninety percent of Americans think we should have universal background checks. Not only are we not listening to them, we are undermining the criminal background checks system today.  I get that the gun lobby is pretty powerful in this place. I get that they have stood in the way of changes in our criminal background checks system that were supported by 90 percent of But even I wasn't cynical enough to think they had so much power that they could get Congress to roll back, to undermine the criminal background check system in the wake of this continued horrific level of gun violence all across the country.  Senator Wyden is right. The danger in this is not just that it has the immediate impact of undermining the criminal background check system, but it potentially blocks our ability to get this right in the future. We don't know what the precedent is for CRAs because we haven't done them before. What we know is that it says you can't pass any regulation that is substantially similar to the regulation that you legislated on. Well, what does that mean in the context of keeping people with serious mental illness off the criminal background check system? Does that mean we can't ever legislate or regulate on the narrow issue of individuals who have had their right of financial affairs restricted through Social Security, or is that a broader prohibition that limits the administration's ability to regulate on strengthening of the criminal background check system in a much more comprehensive way?  We are playing with fire here because this is a precedent we know nothing about. We are playing with fire because we are potentially limiting the ability to ever get this issue right in the future when 90 percent of Americans want us to work together on it.  I understand this issue is a sensitive one. Having spent my entire career working hand in hand with committed advocates for people with mental illness, I understand the danger of conflating mental illness with violence. But this is a narrow category of individuals who by definition fit the parameters in existing law for those who are supposed to be on the NICS system.  For all the things that we disagree about on gun policy--I don't suspect we are going to get a meeting of the minds this Congress on whether all gun sales should be subject to background checks. I don't suspect we are going to figure out a way to work together on restricting access to high-capacity magazines or assault weapons. I thought at least we agreed on keeping the background check system that we have.  The existing law says that individuals who lack the mental capacity to manage their own affairs should be included on the list of those who are prohibited from buying weapons, and today we are undermining that existing law. We are undermining the enforcement of current statute--something Republicans have said over and over again they are not interested in doing.  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this measure.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from South  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1142-3.txt,1837,THE 2020 PLAN,2017.0,14.0,February

1116,topic-id,5069,"Thank you, Mr. Once again, let me extend my gratitude to all of the staff who are pulling yet another overnight. I know this isn't easy, and I feel like every time we have done one of these I have been on the floor during the late night or very early morning hours to express my gratitude to those who are making this possible.  While I am grateful for those who are here, I think it is also incredibly important and vital that we are here. This is exceptional to have so many late nights, to have pushed through the evenings, to stay in session 24 hours and 48 hours at a time. I understand that last week we engaged in the longest session--second longest continuous session in the history of the Chamber, and I think we are doing so because we are living through truly exceptional times today.  We are living through a moment where this administration is simply not prepared to govern, and many of the individuals who are being appointed to Cabinet positions, being selected to serve in this administration simply aren't ready to get the job done.  We saw that with respect to Michael Flynn, who was named to quite possibly the most important position in the national security The National Security Advisor is, on most days, the first person and the last person the President talks to about national security, about protecting the Many of us raised alarm bells when Mr.Flynn was selected for the job because of his radical statements on Islam, his questionable connections to Russia, having sat next to Vladimir Putin in a celebration of Russian propaganda didn't seem right to us, something didn't smell right to many of us. We expressed those objections when Mr.Flynn was chosen. Our objections did not prevail, and within 30 days Mr.Flynn was fired from his position. It is still unclear as to why he was fired. The President was out in front of the cameras, bizarrely defending Mr.Flynn to the cameras having just fired him 30 days into the job, but it seems that it was some combination of undermining a sitting President by attempting to coordinate with the Russian Ambassador right after President Obama had levied sanctions on Russia, potentially making some promises to the Russians that they didn't have to worry about it because once the Trump administration got into office, they would modify or lift those sanctions or perhaps it was lying to the Vice President and others in the White House about what the substance of those conversations were.  Regardless, within 30 days, maybe the most important person in the security Cabinet, who many of us thought[[Page S1351]]was unqualified, was fired from his position in the shortest tenure that anybody could discover for National Security  More news in the last 48 hours is that there were a host of other White House officials who were unceremoniously ushered out of the White House because they couldn't pass their criminal background checks. Why on earth they were in the White House working in positions if they hadn't already taken criminal background checks, that is a very important question we should get answers to, but yet another example of selection of people to serve in sensitive posts who weren't ready for the job.  Betsy DeVos wasn't ready for her confirmation hearing. She came to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and didn't know the basic facts about Federal education law. She couldn't tell the difference between measuring proficiency and measuring growth, and maybe for most people you don't know the difference either, but if you are going to be the Secretary of Education, you have to know the difference between measuring for proficiency and measuring for growth. She was confused about the Federal law that guarantees children with disabilities an equal education. She told Senator Kaine and Senator Hassan it would be OK for States to ignore that law or ignore that protection. That actually is not the case. Every State has to observe the individuals with disabilities law as it pertains to students.  Just this week, we had a nominee withdraw after a drip, drip, drip of allegations regarding his personal conduct and his business practices made it pretty clear that somebody whose restaurants are half the time in violation of Federal labor laws, somebody who has employed undocumented workers probably isn't suitable to be the chief protector of workers in this country as the Secretary of the Department of It just doesn't seem that a lot of thought has been put into some of these selections.  So we are taking our time. We are using our prerogative as Members of the minority party to make sure there is a full, complete debate on all these nominees to make sure, at the very least, the American public knows what they are getting.  Our worry is not just that these nominees are often woefully unprepared for the job, it is that many of them appear to be fatally compromised. I listened to a lot of what President Trump said on the campaign trail, and I heard him spending a lot of time attacking the way business had historically been done in Washington, Maybe some of us privately cheered him on when we heard him say that because we have watched corporate America own this town for a long time.  I watched the drug industry essentially have veto power over health policy in this town. I have watched the oil and gas industry run the show. From a personal basis, nothing aggrieves me more than seeing the gun industry get whatever they want from this If you have a couple hundred million dollars of market capitalization and a good lobbyist and a political action committee you can get a lot done in  So maybe when I tried to think of that silver lining to the election of Donald Trump to the Presidency of the United States, something that was deeply morally objectionable to me, it was that maybe there is a possibility to take on some of these special interests, to say enough is enough, the size of your wallet shouldn't have anything to do with the amount of influence you command here, but then those hopes were dashed as we watched who President Trump decided to nominate for the  Over and over again, billionaires, sometimes millionaires, but more often than not billionaires were selected for this Cabinet, many of whom had ties to the very special interests or were members of the very special interests that Donald Trump told people he was going to take on when he became President of the United  So we had one of the biggest fast food operators being installed in the Department of Labor--somebody who attacked workers and said that break time was a nuisance, that robots should replace his employees, we had an oil executive nominated to serve as our chief diplomat, and now we have an individual who has very publicly and unapologetically done the bidding of big energy companies being enlisted to be the chief environmental protector in this country.  So we are here tonight because the nomination and selection of Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the EPA fits neatly into a pattern of behavior by this administration in which very, very rich people or people who have very close ties to powerful interests are being put in the government, and our worry is that they are being put there not to serve the American people but to serve those interests.  Scott Pruitt has a very interesting history of defending the oil and gas industry, which I admit is important to his State of Oklahoma--more important than it is in my State of Connecticut--but he has a very interesting history of defending that industry against the Scott Pruitt has sued the EPA to overturn standards to curb mercury and other toxic air pollutants, standards that would prevent 11,000 premature deaths and up to 130,000 asthma attacks per year.  He sued to void standards to reduce soot and smog pollution, projecting to prevent up to 15,000 nonfatal heart attacks, to prevent 34,000 premature deaths, and almost 400,000 asthma attacks every year.  He sued unsuccessfully to overturn the EPA's scientific danger determination that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping air pollutants are harmful, and he even sued to block water pollution into the Chesapeake Bay which has no connection to  Scott Pruitt has been a crusader. He has been a crusader on behalf of the energy industry against environmental protection, and he would probably tell you there is a choice to be made between protecting our environment and protecting our economy. That is ridiculous. That is patently ridiculous.  If we don't protect our planet, if we don't protect the quality of our air and the quality of our water, there will be no planet for businesses to grow in, and every kid who suffers through a lifetime of asthma is a fundamentally less productive worker to be able to add value to the American economy. When you are attacking health standards that would reduce asthma attacks by over 500,000 a year, you are attacking the economy, not just the environment.  It is really hard for a kid to learn and become an entrepreneur or a business creator if they are not healthy. Frankly, it is really hard for a family to be able to manage their own economic affairs when they have kids who are that unhealthy. So Scott Pruitt, in continuing to attack the EPA, continuing to stand up for the oil and gas industry, is weakening our economy.  Maybe even more importantly, when you are standing up for only one segment of the energy industry, you are ignoring all the potential jobs that come through a true energy transformation. I get it that today there are a lot of oil jobs in Oklahoma, but there could also be a lot of wind and solar and advanced battery and fuel cell jobs in his State as well. Frankly, as you look at the jobs that will be created over the next 50 to 100 years, not just in this country but across the globe, the real job growth in the energy sector is not just going to be in the oil and gas sector, it is going to be in this broader renewable energy sector.  I don't know if these statistics are up to date, but a few years ago, I read that, of the top 10 solar companies in the world, the United States has one of them; of the top 10 wind turbine companies in the world, the United States has one; and of the top 10 advanced battery companies in the world, the United States has two. There are going to be millions and millions of jobs to be had all across the world in the renewable energy economy.  So long as our energy policy is only about protecting oil and gas and coal and not about truly advancing renewable energy, we are hurting our economy; we are preventing massive job creation from happening; and we are letting other countries eat our lunch because 9 out of those 10 top wind turbine companies and top solar companies and 8 out of those top 10 advanced battery companies are in other countries--other countries that have decided to have policies that create internal markets for those new renewable technologies, unlike here in the United States.[[Page S1352]]  Germany is pumping out wind turbines and is selling them all over the globe, not because Germany has any more wind than the United States but because they have decided to pursue a policy in which they give advantage to those renewable energy companies. The United States has decided to pursue policies, by and large, through giving advantage to fossil fuel companies.  In making his name as a crusader against the EPA, not only is Scott Pruitt endangering the health of our kids, but he is endangering the health of our economy as well. It is not guesswork when it comes to the connection of Scott Pruitt to the industry. If he had really studied the facts and if he had sat down and sort of weighed the benefits of the industry's claims against the benefits of the claims of 99 percent of the scientists in this country, it would be worth a listen.  But, as attorney general of Oklahoma, he sent a letter to the EPA, skewering its efforts to limit methane leaks from oil and gas companies. He didn't write the letter. Nobody on his staff wrote the letter. Oklahoma's Devon Energy Corporation wrote the letter. Pruitt's office changed a few words and sent it on to the EPA on the attorney general's stationery. That is how close the relationship is between Scott Pruitt and these energy companies. He just takes what they write--what they say--and forwards it on under his own signature. If you were to do that in a classroom, that would be plagiarism, and you would get kicked out of school; but if you were to do that as the attorney general of Oklahoma, you would get nominated to be the Administrator of the  It might get a lot worse. You might find out that it is a lot worse on Tuesday of next week because, for some reason, Scott Pruitt has been hiding email correspondence between his office and these energy companies. He has put up roadblock after roadblock to try to stop freedom of information requests to get these emails, this correspondence.  Finally, yesterday, a judge ruled that you cannot stop that information from coming out--they are public documents--and on Tuesday of next week, they are going to be made public. I don't know what they were going to say, but as I suspect with Donald Trump's tax returns, when you are expending great effort to hide something from the American public, there is probably a reason you are hiding those things. There is something incredibly damaging, embarrassing, or illegal in those tax returns, and there is, probably, something very damaging, embarrassing, or illegal in those emails.  So we are rushing through a nomination of Scott Pruitt tomorrow, which will not allow us to see this email correspondence that is going to come out next week. That is a shame because it, likely, will show us how close that connection has been between the next Administrator of the EPA and the energy companies that he has been regulating and will be charged to regulate.  I get really concerned about Scott Pruitt when I think about the kids in my I will tell you about one very specific way in which I think about it, and then I will talk a little bit more broadly.  We have talked a lot about lead, mostly in the context of this tragedy that has played out in Flint, MI, but, in Connecticut, the tragedy of lead poisoning plays out every single day. Why? Because we have really old housing stock; we have old infrastructure; we have lead that is in paint; we have lead that is in pipes; we have lead that is in fixtures that exist in old homes.  While our State has been just plugging along, trying to do better to remediate these old homes and clean up lead and test kids earlier, lead poisoning has been a reality for us in Connecticut for a very, very long time. Boy, there are a lot of awful things that can happen to you as a kid in this country, but lead poisoning is at the top of the list. Watching a family go through the horror of serious lead poisoning is nothing that you want to witness because, once lead gets into your system--once it gets trapped inside your brain--it is impossible to reverse.  In his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt was asked whether there was any safe level of lead in drinking water. If you are going to be the Administrator of the EPA, you should probably know the answer to that question. The answer is, no, there is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Given all of the tumult and attention over what happened in Flint, you would think that would be something he would be prepared for. His response was: ``That's something I have not reviewed nor know about.''  Lead is a neurotoxin that can have devastating, long-term effects on the lives of children. The correct answer, of course, is that there is no level of lead that is safe in drinking water.  I don't want to be too tough on him because I don't expect somebody who hasn't spent his lifetime in the field to know every answer about environmental standards, but this one was a pretty important one. For those of us who do think he is, ultimately, going to do the bidding of industry rather than the bidding of kids, not having an awareness about something as simple as acceptable lead levels in water makes us wonder whether he is really prepared to do his homework because on the other side of the lead fight are special interests. This is one that has special interests too. Whether it be the home builders or other folks who might have to pay a little bit of money out of their pockets to fix up old homes, there are people who are not always with us on this.  More broadly, I worry about my kids. My kids are not going to suffer from lead poisoning, but if we don't get serious about the pace of climate change now--in the next 5 to 10 years--the problem may not be available to solve for my kids. It may be too late, once they become of age, to try to do something about it as a public servant, as a scientist, as an activist. Any scientist can explain the reason for that.  The reason is that, for many greenhouse pollutants--carbon dioxide, in particular--as they get released into the atmosphere, they stay, and they continue to warm--heat up--as time goes on. There are some pollutants that don't act that way. There are these things called fast-acting climate pollutants, like methane, frankly, that are released into the atmosphere, that are powerful heaters for a short period of time, but then they dissipate. Carbon dioxide is different. That one sticks around forever and ever--a long, long time--and continues to heat and continues to heat and continues to heat. So, if you don't reverse the trajectory of the human contribution to climate change soon, it may be too late.  As folks have read, just in the last 60 days, that phenomenon is playing out in parts of the globe that are already at a pace that was unimaginable just 5 years ago. In the Arctic, we are seeing just unthinkable warming.  I don't make policy by anecdote, but about a year ago, I was in the I was on a submarine, doing an exploration under the ice--a truly amazing thing to be a part of. I was on the USS Hartford, which was a ship that was made in Connecticut, and the port is in We were up there as part of an exercise called ICEX, which was an exercise to try to understand what is happening in the Arctic so as to try to understand what the implications are for humans of this massive melting of arctic ice.  There were supposed to be two weekends of exercises in which there was a camp on a very stable piece of ice. Experiments were happening at the camp, and a submarine was helping to engage in those experiments. We were part of the first weekend's exercise. Then, the next weekend, another group of Congressmen was going up to witness that second weekend's exercise. The second group of Congressmen did not make it. They were literally on a van to the plane when they were told there was an emergency evacuation of the camp because the ice was melting underneath the camp. This was a spot that was picked because of how stable they thought it was. In the short period of time in which the camp had existed on the ice that March, it had started to break up and melt underneath them, and they had to engage in an emergency evacuation.  That is just one story. I understand we don't legislate or regulate by anecdote, but when you piece it together with all of the other evidence that tells you that every single year is the warmest on record, that shows you this massive trend line of melting in the Even scientists who were of that 1 percent, who were sort of judged or deemed to be climate skeptics, are now[[Page S1353]]saying: Whoa, there is clearly something nonnatural happening in the Arctic, resulting in this massive melt that happens season after season.  If that melt that is being mirrored in Antarctica continues at this pace, it will be too late for my kids to do something about it. In my State of Connecticut, a coastal State--a State in which the majority of our economic assets are buffered right up against the water of the Long Island Sound--we cannot survive in a world in which sea level rise doubles compared to what it has been over the last 1,000 years.  We cannot survive in a world in which, by the end of this century, the average temperatures will be 8 degrees higher than they are today. When I came to Congress in 2007, the worst case estimates were that, by the end of this century, the global temperature rise would be 6 to 8 degrees beyond what it is today. Those are now mainstream estimates. It is not politicians, and it is not activists. Those are scientists--mainstream scientists--who are making those estimates. Yet, we are going to put somebody into the EPA who proudly has been a mouthpiece for the idea that climate change is a hoax--a hoax.  There is this tiny group of scientists who say: Well, it is not really clear whether human activity is leading to climate change. There is a tiny group of scientists who say that. Ninety percent of scientists agree that humans are contributing to climate change.  But Scott Pruitt goes further than that. Scott Pruitt has said that climate change--he has said it over and over again--that climate change is a hoax. What does that mean? Does that mean it is an intentional campaign by people to try to fool people into believing that climate change is happening? That is an extreme position. I don't even know how you explain what the genesis of the hoax is. What benefit do people get from trying to create this fiction? And of all the people out there who could possibly be the EPA Administrator, President Trump chose someone who calls climate change a hoax.  He had a confirmation conversion. He backtracked on that and said something before the committee about not being completely sure about the human contribution to climate change, but acknowledging that it probably exists. It is not the first confirmation conversion we have had. The Presiding Officer and I were at a very interesting hearing yesterday in which the nominee to be Ambassador to Israel essentially recanted everything he had ever said that was strong in tone about people he disagreed with on the position of U.S.-Israel relations.  So Scott Pruitt has changed his rhetoric in order to get confirmed. But he said that climate change is a hoax enough times to understand that likely, in his gut, that is what he still believes. It was a convenient position to have if you were an attorney general concerned with doing the bidding of big energy companies and special interests, which fed into their narrative as well.  These are exceptional times. I am sorry that we are back on the floor overnight again. But we are deeply concerned that this special interest Cabinet--this billionaire Cabinet--is not being put in place to do right for the American people. It is being put in place to do right for big corporations that don't need any more allies here in For all the rhetoric about upsetting the way things are done in Washington, President Trump is doubling down on special interest influence by handing them the keys to the Secretary's offices and major Departments, now including the Environmental Protection  That was not a President at that press conference yesterday. That was hard to watch, I imagine for both Democrats and It was not a higher calling to public service for anybody in this country. Maybe there was 20 percent of the President's base that the press conference played to, but that was not an advertisement for  These are exceptional times, and they do command those of us who are worried about the direction of this country to use all the power we have to try to get the facts out there and on the record.  I was standing next to Senator Angus King at a press conference shortly after we were sworn in, talking about this issue of climate change and our responsibility as public servants to protect the quality of our air and the quality of our water. We were recalling how this wasn't as partisan an issue 40 years ago as it is today.  The EPA was established under a Republican The Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act had bipartisan support. There was a time in which Republicans were for environmental protection, and now we are nominating somebody to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who made his name fighting environmental protection, who made his name suing the Agency that was established by a Republican President, who has called the global climate change phenomenon, supported by 99 percent of scientists, a hoax.  It is disturbing to many of us how deeply politicized this issue is because it used to be relatively nonpartisan. It used to be that for all of the things we disagreed on, we at least recognized that one of our responsibilities as stewards of this sphere that we live on is to make sure that it exists in the same shape that it is today for our kids.  What Angus King said that day in that press conference, as always, stayed with me. Senator King said that in Maine they have the rototiller rule. If you borrow a rototiller or, frankly, any piece of equipment from your neighbor, you have an obligation when you are done with it to return that piece of equipment to your neighbor, or return that rototiller to your neighbor, in at least as good a condition as you found it. That makes sense. You borrowed the rototiller. If you break it you probably should fix it before you hand it back or you just use it in a way so that you are careful with it so that you don't break it, so that when you give it back to your neighbor, it is in that same condition. Senator King applied that standard to the standard that we should hold ourselves to when it comes to protecting this planet.  My kids are going to inherit this planet. My grandkids, hopefully, will inherent it from them. Our charge should be to hand this planet to our kids in at least as good a shape as we found it. If we break it, if we damage it, we should fix it before we hand it over.  We are breaking this planet right now. We are releasing so much pollution into the atmosphere to have compromised its integrity for the next generation. We have broken the rototiller, and the rototiller rule tells you that before you give it back to your neighbor, you should fix it. And we have it in our power to do it.  When we damaged the ozone layer through the release of CFCs, we got together and fixed that problem. We engaged in a global conversation to regulate CFCs through something called the Montreal protocol. We were able to attack that problem, fix it at no significant cost to the economy, and show that if we really do care about the quality of this globe, there is nothing that is outside of our power. There is no choice to be made between observing the rototiller rule--protecting our planet--and growing our economy.  But if Scott Pruitt becomes the next Administrator of EPA and the oil companies and the gas companies essentially get whatever they want, well, their bottom lines probably will be improved, shareholders in those companies will probably do a little bit better, but our kids' health, our larger economy's future will be compromised.  So that is why we are here on the floor objecting to Mr.Pruitt's nomination. That is why we have asked for this nomination to be delayed until later next week so that we can see what is in these emails, where we already have some pretty concerning evidence of this deep connection between Mr.Pruitt and the companies he will regulate at EPA--a letter that they wrote for him that he sent under his name. What if there is more information like that in this correspondence?  What if there is more evidence that he, as attorney general, was just a mouthpiece for industry rather than a mouthpiece for consumers? What if that is predictive of his behavior at EPA? I think that would be something that both Democrats and Republicans would be concerned with because I think I know my colleagues, and while my colleagues have certainly been more protective of industries' interests than Democrats have been, we both agree that the industry shouldn't have[[Page S1354]]an unnatural advantage in these agencies above the public interest. I am pretty sure we agree on that. And in just 4 short days, we will get a better understanding as to whether that is definitively the case for Scott  So I would urge my colleagues to either delay this vote that is happening later today or to vote against the nomination.

1487,topic-id,1254,"Mr.President, believe it or not, there are some smart people out there in America who are not billionaires. I know it doesn't seem like it as we debate yet another megarich Wall Street titan to head another department in the Federal Government, but billionaires do not actually have a monopoly on wisdom in this country.  But it doesn't seem that this is what our new President thinks. If they all get confirmed, Donald Trump's Cabinet will have a net wealth that is greater than one-third of all Think about that for a second. The Cabinet of the United States will have a net wealth all together that is greater than one-third of every single American--the poorest third of Americans--if you put them all together.  He has nominated millionaires and billionaires to head the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Commerce--the nominee we are now debating--and the Department of Health and Human He even nominated two of his rich friends to head the Army and the  I heard President Trump talk over and over the past 2 years about how he was going to drain the swamp once he got here. As far as I can tell, all he has done thus far is just sell the swamp to his rich friends.  I am not saying that billionaires like Wilbur Ross aren't smart. You have to be pretty savvy in order to make all of that money for yourself or for your investors. There is honor in making money. That is the American dream--to have the opportunity, if you want it, to become very rich, to become very affluent, to create a business that makes you, your family, and maybe those who invested in it very well off. I have a lot of friends who have made a lot of money in and around Wall I don't begrudge the fact that they did it. But making a lot of money for yourself doesn't automatically equate to the ability to run an agency or to run a country.  President Trump made a whole bunch of money for himself, but his first month on the job as President has been a series of not just domestic embarrassments but international embarrassments--writing Executive orders without even checking with the Cabinet to see if what he is doing is legal or illegal; not being able to fill positions in the White House or in Federal agencies--the number of foreign diplomats who tell me they have no idea whom to call right now in the Federal Government is as embarrassing as it is maddening--getting into public spats with even our most reliable allies like Germany and Australia; spending most of his time in pitch battles with the media and his own staff, rather than working with us on trying to solve the problems of this country.  Donald Trump is good at making money for himself, but those skills, as we have found, do not translate very well to running a country. Maybe that is because when the entire focus of your entire life is making as much money as humanly possible for yourself, you cannot pivot on a dime all of a sudden and start putting all of your energy into helping other people. Maybe life doesn't work like that. So that is what really worries me about these billionaire nominees.  A few weeks ago, I was on the floor talking about the now-Secretary of State Rex He spent his career at Exxon helping to build a very successful business, but in doing so, he hurt a lot of people. Exxon deals with horrible dictators who used those oil revenues in order to help murder thousands of their people. That was good for business, but it was awful for humanity.  Andy Puzder, who is no longer a nominee for the Department of Labor, openly mocked his workers. He suggested they just got in the way of the efficient operation of his business, and he pined for the day when robots would replace them.  Now we are debating Wilbur Ross to be Secretary of Wilbur Ross made a lot of money for himself, but he has taken advantage of the very bad trade deals that this body has passed in order to offshore thousands of U.jobs. One such company that he owned, a textile company, employed 4,700 workers in factories in North Carolina and South That was inefficient in Wilbur Ross's desire to make as much money for himself as he could. So he took those 4,700 jobs and he shipped them to He said: This project will benefit from Guatemala's realistic wages.  When Mr.Ross acquired an auto parts factory in Carlisle, PA, a decade ago, in order to make more money for himself, he took a hard line with the workers, demanding cuts in wages and benefits that were worth between 25 and 30 percent of the workers' earnings. That is what he needed to do in order to squeeze as much money out of that company to make himself a few extra million dollars. When the union rejected the demands of Mr.Ross and when the workers rejected those demands, he shut the plant down and moved their work to North Carolina, to Canada, and to  Wilbur Ross, Rex Tillerson, Steve Mnuchin, and Andy Puzder spent their entire lives obsessed with making as much money for themselves as possible and not letting anyone's good fortune get in their way. They fired workers, they foreclosed on people's homes, they shipped jobs overseas, and they supported brutal dictators--all of it justifiable as long as it meant they would make more money for themselves and for their investors. How on Earth has that become a qualification to serve the public, to serve at the highest level of the U.Government?  I am on the floor today to oppose the nomination of Wilbur Ross to be Secretary of Commerce--not because he didn't do a good job enriching himself through the myriad of businesses that he owned and operated during his time in the private sector but because during that time he trampled on the rights of workers, he offshored jobs, and he eliminated people's livelihoods in order to make more money for himself. All of the things that Candidate Trump talked about taking on were the things that Wilbur Ross was doing as he took advantage of these trade agreements to kill jobs in the United States and offshore them to other places.  President Trump said he was going to fight for the working guy. He isn't. He is doing the exact opposite. He is turning the keys of this government over to his wealthy friends so that they can potentially profit off of taxpayer dollars, so that they can deregulate the industries that, by the way, they are going to return to when their term is[[Page S1434]]up. They will get richer, just like they have through their entire lives, while the rest of us pay for it.  It is time for us to recognize that billionaires in this country do not have a monopoly on wisdom. Sometimes the very skills that allow you to make a fortune for yourself don't equate to the skills necessary to fight for everybody else through public service.

565,topic-id,906,"Mr.President, before I begin to speak about the nomination before us right now, I did want to comment on the breaking news regarding the nomination of Andrew  There is some good news today for workers and women and families in Back on the campaign trail, President Trump promised to put workers first, but from the start, it has been pretty clear that his nominee for Secretary of Labor, who has now withdrawn, was a clear signal that President Trump had no intention of keeping that promise, and instead he planned to rig his Cabinet with the staunchest allies for Wall Street--big corporations and special interests--that he could find.  So I am not surprised that when workers and families heard about the pride Mr.Puzder takes in objectifying women, that he called his own workers ``the best of the worst,'' and that his vision for our economy is one in which workers are squeezed so those at the top can boost their profits higher and higher, they said no. They spoke up loud and clear that they want a true champion for all workers in the Labor  I just want to thank all the workers who bravely shared their stories in the last few months. It is clear today that your words are powerful, and I am going to keep bringing your voices here to the Senate, and we will keep fighting.  With that, Mr.President, I wanted to be here today to speak about OMB Director Nominee I submitted comments on this nomination in the Budget Committee, and I want to bring them to the full Senate today.  I am here today to urge my colleagues to oppose Congressman Mr.President, we all know that a budget is more than just numbers on a page; a budget represents our values and our priorities, the kind of Nation we are now and the kind of Nation we want to be.  Congressman Mulvaney is not shy about where he stands on this. When I sat down with him a couple of weeks ago, he made it very clear that he would use our budget to radically reshape our country in a way that I believe would be devastating to families, to seniors, to veterans, to the middle class, and to many others.  Congressman Mulvaney has said he wants to make drastic, radical cuts to Federal investments, trillions of dollars across the board. His budget proposals would slash Federal funding for education, leaving students across the country with fewer opportunities to learn and to succeed. They would cut investments in jobs and training, leaving our workers scrambling to keep up with the changing economy. They would eliminate support for children and families who need a hand up to get back on their feet. They would eliminate basic medical research that creates jobs and leads to lifesaving cures. They would continue the work President Trump has done to destroy healthcare in America and create even more chaos and confusion. They would lead to dramatic cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, betraying the commitments we have made to our seniors and so much more. He wants to do that while giving away even more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations and has proposed raising the Social Security retirement age to 70, causing millions of Americans to drop under the poverty line. In other words, Congressman Mulvaney's nomination is another perfect example of how President Trump is breaking the promises he made on the campaign trail to stand with workers and seniors and the middle class.  Just a few years ago, Congressman Mulvaney was at the fringes of the Republican He is one of the most extreme members of the tea party wing of the party who supported the government shutdown when others were working to end it; who failed to show the proper concern about a potentially catastrophic breach of the debt limit and remains cavalier even now, telling me he would advise the President against accepting a clean debt limit; who, by the way, isn't even willing to support the budget deal I reached with Speaker He is someone whom responsible members of his own Republican Party scorned just a few years ago and whose budget ideas they rejected as damaging, unworkable, and political suicide. But now he is the person whom Republicans are holding up as a budget leader.  As we see this nomination, as we see Republicans use the budget process to slam through a partisan plan to destroy our healthcare system, it is clearer than ever how far the Republican Party has moved, even from the days of our bipartisan budget deal.  Finally, I am extremely troubled by Congressman Mulvaney's failure to pay taxes and comply with the law. I know I am not the only one who has been here long enough to see Cabinet nominees withdraw over less egregious breaches than this. Congressman Mulvaney's motivations, explanations, and defenses have not been credible. It is hard to believe that every single one of my Republican colleagues feels comfortable with someone with such a serious lapse of judgment in charge of the budget of this administration.  I voted against Congressman Mulvaney in the Budget Committee for those reasons and more, and I am here today to oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Certainly, we can do better than this.  Thank you, Mr.President, and I yield the floor.

972,topic-id,829,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to vote no on the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a nomination that marks yet another broken promise from the new President to put the needs of American families first over the wishes of big corporations and special interests. And just like we have seen with Betsy DeVos at the Department of Education or Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, we have yet another Trump nominee whose record demonstrates a direct conflict with the mission of the agency they wish to lead. On the EPA's website, that mission is pretty clear--``to protect human health and the environment''--and EPA achieves that by enforcing regulations based on laws passed by So I will be voting no on this nomination.  I want to make two points on why Mr.Pruitt heading up the EPA would be wrong for our country and why it would be wrong for the families I represent in Washington It starts with his record and clear conflicts of interest.  During Mr.Pruitt's term as the attorney general for Oklahoma, he filed no less than 19 cases to overturn environmental regulations, including one to topple the EPA's Clean Power These regulations specifically seek to protect public health by reducing harmful air and water pollution and are projected to save tens of thousands of lives each year.  As if it wasn't bad enough that Mr.Pruitt spent so much time filing lawsuits in court and fighting policies designed to protect the health of the environment as well as people, it is pretty shocking that at the same time, he was collecting millions of dollars from the very industries he will regulate if he is confirmed. This is no small conflict of interest between his former and potentially future position, and that he was still nominated to be EPA Administrator is mind-blowing to me.  I echo the sentiments of so many who have expressed serious concerns about Mr.Pruitt's conflict of interest, that his ties to the fossil fuel industry make him more indebted to backing policies that loosen environmental regulations, benefiting big oil and gas companies, rather than backing policies that protect the American people.  Mr.President, I want to voice another concern my constituents have shared with me. It is unnerving to think the President would choose a climate change denier to set our national environmental policy. I don't see how someone who has openly denied the existence of climate change--the devastating effects of which we are already beginning to see in Washington State and around the country--will effectively protect human health or the environment.  This is about more than just the environment. A report by the Congressional Budget Office last year found that climate change is a serious threat to our economic stability. As the occurrence of national disasters continues to rise, the cost of disaster assistance and rebuilding rises too.  If we want to be responsible about tackling our fiscal challenges--which I would think the President and Mr.Pruitt would agree on--we need to take the impacts of climate change seriously. At a time when we are already seeing the very real effects of climate change in my home State, from longer, more devastating wildfire seasons to ocean acidification and rising sea levels, it is more important than ever. This brings me to how Mr.Pruitt's confirmation would be devastating for my home State of  As someone who personally spends a great deal of time fishing and hiking in my home State of Washington, I am committed to conservation and preservation efforts so generations to come can appreciate the high quality of life we enjoy and experience the splendor of America's natural spaces, one of the most important being the restoration and recovery of salmon runs and habitat throughout the Pacific Northwest, which is a vital part of our Northwest economy and its heritage.  I am deeply concerned about whether this support would continue under an EPA Administrator like Mr.I have similar concerns about the Hanford cleanup, a critical part of our State's history that EPA plays a very important role in to protect the health and safety of our Tri-Cities community, Columbia River, and Washington  I will fight against any EPA nominee or an Administrator who will not join us in the fight for a better future for generations to come. I sincerely hope the President and Mr.Pruitt truly understand the enormous responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency, not only in protecting our environment for future generations but for the families we represent who rely on clean air and clean water right now.  For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we need to act now to avoid lasting, irreversible damage to our health, our environment, our economy, and our country's future.

One could say that Mr.Petersen got in on the ground floor at PNNL when its scientists were providing critical support to win the cold war.  While at Battelle, Mr.Petersen worked in communications and was the manager of the news service. One of his chief responsibilities was to give tours of the Hanford site to new employees, elected officials and dignitaries, and later, foreign visitors. Congresswoman Catherine May, the first woman elected to Congress from Washington State, was the first Member of Congress Mr.Petersen gave a tour to, but she was certainly not the last. Senator Warren Magnuson, Speaker Tom Foley, and I, to name a few others, have all crisscrossed the Hanford site with Mr.He even helped with President Richard Nixon's visit. By now, Mr.Petersen has probably given thousands of tours of Hanford, and many, including myself, have heard the stories from years past, from bumping into the woman who he would later marry during a tour, to the alligators, to bringing moon rocks from the Apollo 11 mission to Hanford for public display.  Mr.Petersen's work with nuclear management began in 1974 for Westinghouse on the construction, start-up, and operation of the Fast Flux Test Reactor and then the Washington Public Power Supply System, which is now Energy After spending some time on the International Nuclear Safety Program through the U.Departments of Energy and State, Mr.Petersen returned to Battelle as the director of communications and administration at PNNL in the late 1980s.  When he retired from Battelle in 2002, Mr.Petersen was quickly recruited by Sam Volpentest to help him at the Tri-Cities Washington Economic Development Council in a part-time, volunteer capacity to travel to Washington, DC, to secure funding to support Hanford and This part-time job quickly became a full-time job, and Mr.Petersen has been advocating on behalf of the Tri-Cities ever since. Since my first days in the Senate, I have worked with Mr.Petersen, and he has been a key ally during many a funding battle. He knows the budget as well as any staff member on the Appropriations Committee, and this isn't just limited to nuclear waste cleanup, but also includes research and development capabilities that support the PNNL mission, transportation, agriculture, and so much more.  It is clear to me that Washington State has benefited greatly from Mr.Petersen's vision and passion for sharing what the Tri-Cities community, its workforce, the Hanford site, and PNNL have to offer. I have seen this firsthand at home and here in the other His work is evident in the progress that has been made on environmental cleanup at Hanford, to charting out a future vision for the Tri-Cities that looks past cleanup operations to preserving history through designating the B Reactor as a National Historic Landmark and the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, to growing the workforce safety mission at the Volpentest Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response Federal Training Center, and to seeking out new, emerging opportunities like small modular reactors. Through it all, he has remained as committed as they come. Last October, when I had the good fortune to get one more tour with Mr.Petersen at the Hanford site, I saw that he still carried the same enthusiasm and pride for his work as what I had seen in him on my very first tour years ago.  Mr.Petersen has been critical to my work in the Senate and has made a tremendous impact on the Tri-Cities community, Washington State, and our Today I join with others throughout the State of Washington in thanking him for his many years of service.

741,topic-id,306,"Madam Speaker, Republicans are continuing their crusade to cut off access to comprehensive family planning services. Last year they tried to zero out title X in their budget. This year they intend to repeal ACA's cost-free contraception coverage for women with private insurance. Today Republicans are attempting to stop the flow of title X grants to health centers around the country.  Title X grants ensure that low-income families have access to birth control and can plan their pregnancies so that moms and kids stay healthy. Research has shown that without these vital services, the unintended pregnancy rate would be 33 percent higher and the number of abortions would also be higher. My anti-choice Republican colleagues should cheer this program, but instead not only are Republicans trying to defund Planned Parenthood so they won't be able to provide contraception help, but now we are hypocritically rolling back a rule that allows title X funds to flow to reproductive health centers, which are the most effective providers of title X services and which we were told would provide the contraception and other health services that Planned Parenthood no longer would be able to.                              {time}  1445  Women are watching us today.

344,topic-id,529,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.42, a measure disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor regarding drug testing unemployment compensation applicants. This legislation would overturn a Department of Labor regulation which, as directed by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, defines the occupations in which States may require unemployed workers to take drug tests as a condition of collecting earned unemployment benefits. Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, which protects us against searches without reasonable cause, the regulation limits drug testing to occupations where drug testing is required, like pipeline safety, some transportation operators, and jobs that require carrying a gun.  Many communities are facing a rising rate of drug use, including my hometown of Congress could and should do more to help people struggling with addiction, but the legislation that we are debating today has nothing to do with fighting drug abuse. It is about allowing States to put one more time-consuming, humiliating obstacle in the way of Americans who work hard and were laid off from their jobs and need unemployment insurance to pay the bills while they look for new jobs. As a reminder, in the aftermath of the recession, the unemployment rate in America went to 10 percent.  There is no evidence that unemployed workers have higher rates of drug abuse than the general population. In fact, logic suggests that rates of serious drug abuse are lower. To be eligible to collect unemployment, a worker must have substantial, recent work experience. He or she must not have been fired for cause. And workers can only collect unemployment insurance if they demonstrate they are actively searching for work.  Instead, it appears that some States may be trying to limit the number of workers who collect unemployment insurance when they are laid off as a way to reduce pressure on underfunded unemployment trust funds. More than half of the State unemployment trust funds are still insolvent, years after the Great  Dozens of States have changed their eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits, imposed administrative hurdles to filing for unemployment, or cut the number of weeks benefits can be received while individuals search for a job. Partly because of those changes, only about one in four unemployed workers in the United States receive unemployment benefits, even though the vast majority of them worked for employers who paid unemployment payroll taxes on their wages. That is the lowest level of benefit receipt among laid-off workers since the Federal-State unemployment insurance program began.  Instead, we should be here crafting bipartisan policies to strengthen unemployment insurance protections to help workers who genuinely want to work to pay their bills while they are looking for new jobs. I remind our colleagues to look at the worker participation rate, not encouraging States to create more obstacles.  I hope that both sides of the aisle will vote ``no'' on this resolution.

362,topic-id,482,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the doctor for that Webster's dictionary. That dictionary was published in Springfield, Massachusetts, and I am glad that the doctor from Tennessee sees it as the last word.  Mr.Speaker, let me rise in opposition to the CRA resolutions we are debating today that would block Department of Labor regulations on State-run retirement programs. Our country is in the midst of a retirement savings crisis, as duly noted. To address this issue, we should be working together to help people get into a responsible retirement savings plan. Half the people who get up to go to work every single day in America are not in a qualified savings plan for retirement.  This opportunity here is to begin a history lesson. In July of 2007, a decade ago, I introduced the Automatic IRA Act with my Republican Ways and Means colleague, Phil That same year, Senators Bingaman and Smith introduced a companion bill in the U.The Brookings Institution and The Heritage Foundation scholars jointly developed my auto IRA concept. So conservatives and liberals came together on a commonsense proposal to make it easier for working families to save.  However, fast forward to 2017. I can't find a Republican to join me in sponsoring the auto IRA legislation. Remember, The Heritage Foundation worked with me to construct this initiative. If we can just keep it amongst ourselves here, being a Democrat from Massachusetts and having a plan that is endorsed by The Heritage Foundation is not one of our easier endeavors. But between Brookings, a liberal think tank, and Heritage, a conservative think tank, we came up with a pretty good plan.  Today American families struggle to prepare for retirement. To make matters worse, 55 million Americans work for employers who don't offer a retirement plan. As I noted earlier, that is half the workers between 18 and 64.  Because of Congress' failure to act on any legislation and address the retirement savings crisis, many States implemented their own auto IRA plans based upon the Neal-English bill. In fact, 30 States have moved to implement or are considering a State-facilitated retirement plan. Credit unions would love this, community bankers would love this, and insurance agents would like to sell these plans, but here we can't find a Republican to sign on.  So today they are trying to block the guidance that provides clarity and flexibility to States that want to launch their own initiative. This is troubling. If these resolutions become law, it would have a chilling effect on State efforts. The States are the laboratories of experimenting on these retirement plans because the Federal Government doesn't get it done. If Republicans are looking for a single national effort, let's work together to develop a Federal auto IRA legislation piece that would work in the interim and work in the future and help people set up, Mr.Speaker, a responsible retirement savings plan.

542,topic-id,1872,"Mr.President, we are moving forward now on the consideration of Congressman Mick Mulvaney, the President's nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget, which is an enormous responsibility and which often directs the traffic of what is going to happen in all of the agencies and directs traffic as to what legislation the White House is going to be working on and working with the Congress on. This is an enormous responsibility and a very powerful position.  When looking for someone to lead this agency, we have to carefully consider the person's record. The Presiding Officer is someone who is practical, who is a military officer, and who understands a lot about human nature, as I hope this Senator from Florida does, and what I suspect that both of us have found is that you can often tell where a fellow is going by where he has been.  Let's look at Congressman Mulvaney's record on everything from things like Social Security and Let's look at what his record is on climate change and sea level rise, and, oh, by the way, of particular note to the gentleman presiding in the Chair, what is his record on defense spending. Office of Management and Budget is going to have a great deal to say about what is in the budget with regard to any kind of spending, but let's see what he has said with regard to defense spending.  Congressman Mulvaney has advocated for raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70. He has also said he wants to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, both of which would require senior citizens to work longer, even though they have worked a long time and have paid into these programs in good faith.  Take, for example, People have tried to provide for health insurance, if they have enough money, or otherwise through the ACA, getting subsidies to afford health insurance or, if they don't have enough money, having Medicaid, and they are waiting for the day they turn 65 to be eligible for  It is the same thing with Social Social Security over time has been raised from 65 to 67, but Congressman Mulvaney has talked about raising the eligibility for Social Security to age 70. I don't think this is going to go over too well with a population of senior citizens who have paid into Social Security, who have paid in to finance Medicare and now are being told they are going to have to wait until later.  I know how you can dress it up. You can say: Oh, it is not going to affect anybody who is currently eligible, but what about all the young people who are paying in? Well, time flies, and suddenly they find they are approaching that age in their midsixties. I don't think people are going to take very well to Congressman Mulvaney's position.  Let's see what else he has said. He called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He further has said he supports turning Medicare into a voucher system. That, under any independent economist's examination, would lead to big cuts for seniors, many of our senior citizens who have no other options for health coverage.  When the President was running for office--remember, he said exactly the opposite. Then-Candidate Trump said he promised there would be no cuts to Medicare and Social Yet the White House has nominated somebody who has taken positions contrary to that because it is clear from Congressman Mulvaney's past positions, that we can't rely on him to keep this promise that the President made.  Again, I remind our listeners that the head of the OMB is like a chief air traffic controller. He is directing a lot of the traffic of what the White House will bless, and it is a position--need I remind you--that is also considered a member of the President's Well, the positions Mulvaney has taken are opposite to those stated by Candidate  Let's look at something else. You know the Nation has debt. In fact, U.bonds are the strongest investment in the world because they are backed up by the full faith and credit of the U.Government, the strongest government in the world. So any kind of U.debt, backed by the full faith and credit, is the strongest investment in the world, but Congressman Mulvaney has taken an alarming position on our Nation's debt, advocating for shutting down the government and defaulting on the debt--all a part of a political game to gain leverage in budget battles.  Anybody who takes a position that you want our government to go into default on its financial obligations--that is a pretty extreme position. So this Senator would merely say we can't have somebody in charge of our budget as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget who is willing to risk a default on our government to meet a personal ideological agenda.  Let's look at something else. The Presiding Officer is in one area of the United States outside of the continental United States, and yours truly is in another part of the United One is near the Arctic, and the other is near southern climes. Our State, and specifically South Florida, is ground zero for sea level rise.  I think most people are familiar with the photographs on television showing seawater washing through the streets during the seasonal high tides of Miami Most people have heard that in some of the coastal cities they had to relocate well fields further west because of sea level rise and the intrusion of salt water, which is heavier than freshwater, into the interior. Florida sits on top of a honeycomb of limestone that is filled with water. That is what is happening in the southern part of the United  A NASA scientist testified to the Commerce Committee that--these are measurements, not forecasts or projections but measurements over the last 4 years--the sea has risen in South Florida 5 to 8 inches. Of course, we have heard the projections. This is something we are getting ready for. The city of Miami Beach is spending millions of dollars on very expensive pumps. Other governments in South Florida are planning to do the same. It is not a forecast. It is happening.  Three-quarters of our State's population in Florida lives on the coast. Look at the population in the United A lot of people live on the coast, and those populations are going to bear the brunt of sea level rise from the flooded streets to tainted drinking water. But during his confirmation hearing, the fellow being considered to be head of the OMB, Congressman Mulvaney, questioned the scientific fact of climate change.  We can't muzzle scientists. We can't muzzle science. It is not going to go away. You can attempt to muzzle the scientists as some Governors in the South have done, and alarmingly, as I have found in the last few weeks, some agencies of government are having implied threats that they stop using the words ``climate change.'' You can't muzzle this when the effects of scientifically proven climate change are[[Page S1172]]posing a real threat to a lot of our people.  I specifically made it a point to question the fellow whom we will vote on next week--a really good person, Wilbur Ross, who is going to be the Secretary of He came out of our Commerce Committee with an overwhelming vote. I specifically said, and it is on the record: What do you think about climate change science?  I said: Mr.Ross, Wilbur Ross, do you know you have three Nobel laureates as scientists who are employed in the Department of Commerce? Do you know that you have not only NOAA and all the intricate measurements that are so important for us to protect ourselves, to read in-bound hurricanes, tornadoes, the amount of rain that is going to fall for our agriculture industry, all the rest, but also we have scientists over there in the Department of Commerce, I reminded him, who are doing the delicate measurements of science, of standards and technology that are kneading science to sniff the atmosphere for nuclear explosions by potential enemies. We don't want to muzzle these scientists. We want them to bring forth the best that they can come up with in modern-day techniques.  I would ask the Presiding Officer to look at the bill we have filed with a number of our fellow Members of the Commerce Committee, the Scientific Integrity Act, which would ensure that Federal scientists can freely communicate their findings with the public and with It requires Federal agencies to implement and enforce scientific integrity policies and to ensure that adequate procedures are in place to report when those integrity policies are violated. That ought to be common sense. That ought to be the normal course of business around here. Let people speak their minds, speak their expertise. That is what we want. That bill requires Federal agencies to implement and enforce those policies.  Let's get to defense spending. The nominee for Office of Management and Budget--Congressman Mulvaney's--record on military spending is concerning. In 2011, in an interview on ABC's ``Top Line,'' Congressman Mulvaney said:       Defense has to be cut--it has to be on the table, no      question. There is a group of Republicans--myself included--     who think that we should be cutting defense. There's a large      portion of folks in our own party who know that you can cut      defense and not impact the ability of our troops in the field      to be defending us.  Why don't we ask the people in Ukraine who are fighting for their lives against the projected arm of Vladimir Putin trying to take over their territory, just like he already did in taking over Crimea? Why don't we ask our NATO allies? Why don't we ask our troops in the hot, sandy regions of Iraq and Syria right now? Yes, our U.troops are in Syria--the Special Operations forces advising the combined forces over there fighting Why don't we ask them if they want defense cuts? As we see the continuous projection of the ability of Russia to move on to three Baltic States which are our NATO partners, why don't we ask them if they would like our defense budget cut? Why don't we ask our allies in the Pacific region that are so concerned about the testing of these increasingly longer range, intermediate range ballistic missiles by North Korea--why don't we ask them if they want us to cut back on the assets that we have in the region to be able to protect them from the North Koreans if that child dictator suddenly goes off on some crazy tangent and pushes the button?  So I will just summarize and state that Congressman Mulvaney has repeatedly demonstrated an unwillingness to face domestic and global realities, and for this Senator, that raises serious concerns as to whether he can be trusted to responsibly oversee our Nation's budget process. For these reasons and others, I will be voting no on Congressman Mulvaney's nomination.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

956,topic-id,1045,"Mr.President, I want to speak about this nomination from the standpoint of our State, our State of Florida, because we are famous for sugar-white beaches, fertile fishing grounds, and unique environmental treasures, such as the Florida These precious natural resources need our protection and our stewardship. In fact, Florida's multibillion-dollar tourism industry is driven by the fact that people come to our State to enjoy these kinds of environmental treasures.  I have just come from a meeting with the American Hotel & Lodging With multibillions of dollars of investments all over Florida, what happens if the guests don't come? That is a major investment that is lost.  And, oh, by the way, a few years ago during the BP oil spill--when the oil got only as far east from Louisiana as Pensacola Beach, and some oil was in Choctawhatchee Bay and Destin and some tar balls were as far east as Panama City Beach, but not any further--the visitors didn't come because they thought the beaches were covered with oil.  Well, right now Florida's unique environment is threatened by several environmental challenges, from the threat of fracking in this honeycomb of limestone filled with freshwater that supports the peninsula of Florida to algal blooms that have plagued much of Florida's Treasure Coast this last year, to the red tide in the Tampa Bay area, and to Burmese pythons in the And that is just a little bitty partialness of the plagues. To deal with these challenges, States such as ours depend on the EPA as a backstop.  I am here to express my concerns about the President's pick to lead this agency. It has been well documented that the President's pick is a friend of the oil industry. There is nothing wrong with that. But this is an industry that has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions to Mr.Pruitt and the PACs supporting him over the years.  Ever since I was a young Congressman, I have been fighting to keep oil rigs off the coast of In the first place, there is not a lot of oil out there, but Florida's unique environment--from what I just told you about, the BP oil spill--its tourism-driven economy, and, oh, by the way, the largest testing and training area for the U.military in the world, the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida, as well as all of the testing ranges on the east coast, and how about the rockets coming out of the[[Page S1242]]Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the rockets coming out of the Kennedy Space Center--because of all of those, you can't have oil rigs down there. For all of those reasons, it makes Florida incompatible with offshore oil drilling. An EPA Administrator with such close ties to the oil industry is deeply concerning for the people of  But Mr.Pruitt's ties to Big Oil aren't the only concern that we have in During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt said that he believes that his views on climate change are ``immaterial'' to the job of the EPA  Whoa, the EPA Administrator is directly involved in things that involve climate change. I can't think of a more relevant issue for our EPA Administrator to be concerned with because Florida is ground zero when it comes to the effects of sea level rise.  These are not projections, not forecasts. These are measurements over the last 40 years in South The sea has risen 5 to 8 inches.  By the way, where is three-quarters of the population of Florida? It is along the coast. We are already seeing regular flooding at the mean high tide in the streets of Miami Beach, and they are spending millions on infrastructure in order to get those pumps working to get the water off the streets and raising the level of the streets.  We are seeing the saltwater, which is heavier than freshwater, seep into the ground where there is a honeycomb of limestone filled with freshwater, and the seawater is seeping into the freshwater. So cities are having to move their city well fields further to the west because of the saltwater intrusion, and it only gets worse.  The threat Floridians face every day is a result of this sea level rise that is very real. It is critical that we have an EPA Administrator that understands that there are things that are happening because of climate change. It is not immaterial to the job of the EPA Administrator; it is very relevant.  There is Mr.Pruitt's history of questioning science, especially when the facts conflict with his friends, whom he surrounds himself with, about the effects of science. So whether it is protecting Florida's livestock from deadly parasites or protecting the air we breathe, science informs policy decisions that affect all of us--clean water, clean air. It affects public health, national security, and the environment.  Yet we continue to see troubling reports about scientists being muzzled from the State level all the way up to the Federal level in the So it just seems that this is unacceptable. Our scientists should be free to publish scientific data and not be muzzled. They should be able to publish their reports without fear of losing their jobs or being censored for using phrases like ``climate change.''  That is why I recently sponsored legislation to protect our scientists from political interference. The Scientific Integrity Act would ensure that Federal scientists can communicate their findings with the public. It requires Federal agencies to implement and enforce scientific integrity policies and ensure that procedures are in place so that if those policies are violated, it is known and there is a procedure to deal with that.  I conclude by stating that Floridians and the State of Florida cannot risk the health of our environment or our economy on an EPA Administrator who pals around with folks that do all of what I am talking about--they question our scientists, denying the true threat we face from sea level rise and climate change. Floridians can't afford such a risk, and they shouldn't be forced to take this risk.

He gave extensive answers during his confirmation hearing before the Commerce He has accumulated significant experience in dealing with the international business community, and he has detailed to the committee--in our examination of him, he detailed many of his ideas.  There have been some questions that have been raised about some of his business ties, particularly involving some of his foreign activities. One example is the Bank of Cyprus, which has significant levels of Russian investment. In the wake of the former National Security Advisor, General Flynn's resignation and under the overhanging question of the unlawful Russian involvement in a U.election, I certainly thought that it was prudent to get Mr.Ross's assurances on this matter in his dealings with the Bank of Cyprus and certain Russians who were involved in the Bank of Cyprus, so on February 16, I sent him a letter, along with four other members of the Commerce Committee, requesting information on any contact Russian investors in the Bank of Cyprus may have with officials from the Trump campaign or the Trump organization. I have spoken with Mr.Ross on at least two occasions since sending him the letter, one of those being today. He has verbally reiterated to me that he only had one meeting, approximately an hour, with one of the bank's Russian investors and that it occurred in 2014. The timing is important--2014--because that was before the Presidential campaign. He also assured me that he knows of no loans or interaction between the bank and anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign or organization.  Mr.Ross has been forthcoming with me, and I believe him in what he has told me, that it is true to his belief. But I want to say that at the same[[Page S1435]]time, the White House and the way they have handled this matter is not doing Wilbur Ross any favors. There are a number of Senators on the Commerce Committee who are extremely troubled and frustrated that the White House has chosen to sit on Mr.Ross's written response to the questions I and other Senators have posed, and they have refused to provide them to the Senate prior to tonight's vote. This is despite repeated phone calls to the White House--repeated phone calls. It is also despite repeated phone calls from me to Mr.Ross to ask him to get the White House off the dime since he has told me he has already filled out the answers in writing--they are just sitting in the White So there is someone in the White House who is making the decision that they don't want the Senate to have, in writing, what Mr.Ross has told me verbally in a private conversation.  If that is any indication of the level of transparency Congress and the American people can expect from this White House, then it appears that there is going to be a lot left on the floor and there is going to be the appearance of being in the dark on a lot of important matters. That is not the way you do confirmations. You do it in a collaborative fashion, especially when you have a good nominee like Wilbur The President proposes, the Congress disposes. The President nominates, the Congress confirms.  Not only is this lack of transparency unsettling, it is behavior that everyone in this Senate should agree is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. I do not want this to be taken out on Wilbur Ross because of the administration's secretive behavior. Instead, as I said at the outset, following my colleague, the chairman of the committee, I am going to urge our colleagues to support his nomination, but the problem is that Wilbur Ross is going to get fewer ``yes'' votes than if the White House would release his written statements to all of those Senators' questions.  As I said, I know Wilbur He is a good man. One of the reasons, aside from this problem of communication with the White House, is that Wilbur Ross brought forth candid answers about the work of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, That agency, which is a part of the Department of Commerce, impacts the daily lives of every single NOAA provides the satellite data that is critical to observing hurricanes and severe weather and everyday forecasts that we have now come to rely on, that we pull up on our smartphones to find out what the weather is going to be. Where do you think that comes from? A lot of it comes from data from NOAA satellites.  Through the National Weather Service, NOAA provides the weather forecasts that drive this economy, answering questions like whether a farmer's crops are going to get rain today or warning of dangerous tornadoes, particularly plaguing the State of the Presiding Of course, we remember the ones that just devastated parts of Georgia and Florida just a few weeks ago.  The National Ocean Service tells us if ships will have enough clearance to get their cargo into a port on time because it often depends on the tide as to how much depth there is with that heavy load of cargo, if they can get in the channel.  NOAA also provides world-class science regarding atmospheric conditions, including climate change and its impacts. My State of Florida, the impacts of climate change--we are ground zero. It is not unusual now that at seasonal monthly high tides, the streets of Miami Beach are flooded, and city wellfields have now had to be moved further to the west away from the Atlantic Ocean because of the rise of sea level and therefore the saltwater intrusion into the freshwater aquifer. Since 2006, Miami Beach has flooded significantly more often than it used to. Rain-related flooding events in southeast Florida have increased by 33 percent, and tide-related flooding has increased by a whopping 400 percent. That is not good for business.  We simply cannot afford to deny what is happening. The impacts of climate change are affecting They are also affecting a lot of other places around the world, read:  NOAA quite literally saves lives and property, so naturally I fully expect any nominee for Secretary of Commerce to unequivocally support the ability of the experts at NOAA to do what they do best: collect the data, do the research, and provide critical products and services to the public free from political interference and free from censorship.  The Department of Commerce has three Nobel laurate scientists who are employees. While some of the nominees for other key administration posts have either been less than forthright, less than committal, or less than knowledgeable about the very real threat posed by climate change, Wilbur Ross candidly and explicitly assured me during his nomination hearing in our Commerce Committee that he believes--and I will quote him--that ``science should be left to the scientists.'' I urge his fellow Cabinet nominees to follow suit. Don't do what we have seen--the intimidation techniques of saying that you can't use the term ``climate change'' or ``sea level rise.'' Let the scientists do their work. Wilbur Ross also assured me that he would work collaboratively ``to address the impacts of changes in sea level and ocean temperatures on coastal communities and fisheries.''  So I want to say to the Senate that I appreciate Wilbur Ross's candor, his commitment, and his recognition that the important weather and climate work being done in NOAA directly benefits commerce. I am confident he is going to follow through.  I also want to thank him, at his age, for offering himself for public service. This is a very schooled, experienced individual.  I hope this hiccup with the White House not being transparent and not returning what he has already written as answers to the Senator's questions--this problem--is going to disappear and, that rather than hinder him, as they have, they will instead support him, as they should.  For that reason, I am here to ask my colleagues to vote yes on Wilbur Ross's nomination.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-27-pt1-PgS1428.txt,859,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,27.0,February

Annual provisions, including the Hyde amendment, have been passed repeatedly and have saved an estimated 2 million innocent lives.  Today, we rise again to stop the taxpayer funding of abortion providers. I want to be clear. Nothing we do today will take a penny from women's health. Instead, we are empowering States to redirect these funds to community health centers and hospitals that offer more comprehensive coverage to women.  In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood performed more than 300,000 abortions while failing to provide even the most basic services, like prenatal care, at many of their facilities.  Hospitals and federally qualified health centers not only offer a broader range of services, but also greater accessibility in many cases. While there is only one Planned Parenthood center in South Dakota, we have six federally qualified health centers that operate in 45 service sites and serve more than 54,000 individuals per year. These care centers offer low-income families health services, but they don't perform abortions. We can support women's health--and, specifically, health care for low-income women--without supporting abortion providers.  Simply put, H.43 does not restrict access or funding to health care for low-income women. What it does do is help protect taxpayers from funding abortion providers. It empowers the States to direct healthcare funding to organizations that truly do support women's health, and it makes strides toward protecting the most vulnerable among us, the unborn.

Throughout Europe, particularly in Switzerland and Germany, they look at working with your hands with just the same dignity as going through college. This country doesn't always do that. Guidance counselors tend to push them into college as the only measurement.  College isn't for everybody. I have three brothers. They went the traditional college route. I decided I really enjoyed working with my hands. I went and became an electrician. Those jobs, we are on over 20 years ago, I still talk to my kids about it today--the dignity of working with your hands.  This country is starting to change, particularly when you need an electrician. When Mr.Boyle's lights in his house go out, who does he call? That electrician is worth his weight in gold, isn't he?  And I know Mr.Boyle's story. His parents came over here as first generation and are living the American They have to be so proud of him.  And in Mr.Veasey's district, those refineries are important for jobs, as they are in mine. I think we absolutely have to keep the focus on making sure that we have renewables, that we have clean energy. But we also understand with each of those decisions comes whether or not somebody is going to be able to go home and say: Honey, I lost my job today.  Today was a remarkable day--the first withdrawal of a nominee for the Department of And I guess this is where, during the election cycle, I see the difference.  It is very clear that the President wanted to talk about jobs, good jobs, putting America back to work. And then we have the secretary nominee put up--who talks about minimum wage is a bad thing, talks about robots are things you don't have argument with. He wants to outsource. That is not the way to rebuild the economy.  Mr.Boyle talked about the discrepancy between those who work for a living, the average worker on the line, and those who are the When I grew up, there was an implied partnership with so many of those companies. Those who went to work in a first-generation company, that CEO knew every employee's name. But time after time, when that company gets sold, that disconnect comes in. They forget about that. And that is where those relationships, that partnership that is so important, starts to break down.  We had a conversation in our Education and the Workforce Committee the other day about the NLRB, which is the group from the Department of Labor that judges whether or not elections with unions are done fairly. There was a suggestion somehow that they are not being treated fairly. It couldn't be any further from the truth. If workers want to have a voice, they should have that voice and choose whether or not they want to join with the union. That is the American way--that democracy. Yet, the nominee for Labor wanted to do away with the In fact, when we look at the total case history, it is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse, unless, of course, you own the henhouse, and then it is okay.  I want to finish up by saying to Mr.Veasey and Mr.Boyle how appreciative I am of keeping this focus on the forefront of what we do here in I created a Building Trades Caucus, along with a colleague, Mr.McKinley, out of West We could try to move this forward, create an infrastructure package that puts America back to work and keeps our roads, our bridges, and our grid safe.

710,topic-id,232,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.43. This resolution is simply another attack on women's health and another attempt by Republicans to limit women's access to high-quality, essential care.  For decades, title X family planning program has funded grants that provide millions of Americans each year with access to a broad range of preventive health services, including contraception care and cancer screenings. Title X is a critical safety net for low-income women and teens; and for many patients, this program is their only source of health care.[[Page H1270]]  But the Republicans want to limit access to these services and allow States to discriminate against certain providers, all as part of their ongoing ideological crusade against abortion.  I stress, this resolution would permit States to prohibit reproductive healthcare providers from participating in the title X program, and would allow States to block access to care if the provider separately performs abortions or is affiliated with health centers that do.  Now, we already have seen what happens when States take actions to discriminate against providers in the title X program. Access goes down, the unintended pregnancy rate goes up, and the spread of sexually transmitted infections increases.  So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution because Republicans should not be entitled to pick and choose providers in the title X program and play politics with women's health.

131,topic-id,573,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.Johnson) for this opportunity.  Mr.Speaker, today, I rise to discuss our commitment to civility, a promise that I have made to my constituents at home and a promise that I have made to my colleagues here in Washington, D. Prior to my being sworn in, during my campaign of 2016, the number one question I heard and I received from the people in my district on the Central Coast of California was: Why would you want to go to Washington, D.C., right now?  I heard that over and over and over. I heard that people were dissatisfied with the dysfunction in I heard that they were disgusted with the partisanship of I heard that they were disheartened with our system of government. And I believe that it is that sentiment that lent to the denouement of November 8.  I admit I was disappointed by the Presidential election, and I believe that partisanship that was displayed during that election continued in Washington, D.It started when I got here for new Member orientation.  When we got here as freshmen, Republicans and Democrats, we were automatically split up. I did not get to know my fellow freshmen Republican colleagues here in D.It wasn't until we went on to Boston and Virginia that we actually took time to get to know each other, where they are from, and what they were about.  What I can tell you--the thing that I say that gives hope to so many people--is that my freshman class heard the exact same things during this past election: That it is time that we get things done and that we do it together.  Now, I believe that once we get past these turbulent times at this point, I do hope we can work together on issues that affect our country, be it immigration reform, investment in our infrastructure, and ensuring that our health care is not just accessible but affordable.                              {time}  1715  But I also realize, as many of you, that that is easier said than done. Yet I believe that to get things done in Congress, you have to treat it like a marathon and not a sprint, and I believe that we begin this race by building relationships.  My predecessor, Congressman Sam Farr, spent 23 years representing the place I call home on the central coast of He will tell you that for most of that time he was in the minority, yet he was able to get numerous things done; and he will tell you that the way he was able to do it is by relationships, with Democrats and  I can tell you that Sam's predecessor would say the exact same thing; and I can tell you that Sam's predecessor and his three roommates, whom I was able to live with back in the eighties, would all say the same thing, that it is the personal chemistry amongst people here in Washington, D.C., that will lead to our ability to compromise professionally. That is what we must develop.  That is why I am honored and pleased to enter into this commitment of civility, for that is the first ingredient to that chemistry that we must strive for. And I believe that this commitment that we have all taken to each other, to our communities, and to our country, that will lead to our constituents' confidence, not just in Congress, but in our democracy.

330,topic-id,213,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak against restricting the family planning services that are provided by title  Just prior to signing title X into law, back in 1970, President Richard Nixon recognized how essential family planning was to public health. He actually sent a message to Congress telling them, ``no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition.'' Last year, Mr.Speaker, President Obama reaffirmed that sentiment by making family planning services a part of basic health care, regardless of where one lives. Although Presidents Nixon and Obama couldn't be more divided in their politics, even they were united behind title I believe this is understandable, considering how title X ensures basic preventive health care and family planning services for 4 million low-income people every year.  In my district, title X family planning services saves an average of $7 on Medicaid-related costs for every dollar of Federal investment. That means that clinics in my district, like Mar Monte, are able to help more women and men receive a full range of healthcare services.  Rather than restricting family planning clinics, we should be promoting, we should be protecting, and we should be preserving access to those vital services, especially for those families that value and need it most.

Mr.Speaker, every American should be able to trust in the promise that, after a life of hard work, a secure and dignified retirement will be there for them. But today, that promise is at risk. Half of all private sector employees in America, almost 60 million people, do not have access to any type of employer-sponsored retirement plan.  It is a problem that Republicans should remember when they plan to raise costs on seniors, when they work to slash Medicaid and they destroy the sacred guarantee of  Yet, once again, Republicans have come to this floor not with the retirement security of hardworking families in mind, but with a greedy Wall Street first agenda.  Under the Obama administration, the Department of Labor empowered the States to create innovative solutions to the retirement savings crisis. The gentleman is talking about--some of these savings didn't even exist when we had the majority.  In States across the Nation, the great laboratories of our democracy went to work just as they should. My State of California decided to create something called Secure Choice, a State-run retirement plan that allows employees to be auto-enrolled into an IRA if they work for a business with five or more employees.  In doing so, California will give almost 7 million workers access to retirement savings--no substitute for a pension or a 401(k), but a vital step toward a greater retirement security. Other States have stepped forward with their own plan, the gentlewoman's State of Oregon being one of them: Oregon, California, Illinois, Washington State,  The Republican measure targets workers' savings accounts in those States and chills efforts to foster retirement savings accounts in some 20 other In some cities, including the city of our chair, Mr.Crowley, New York City is attempting to move in that direction.  So today, instead of supporting States' innovation--this is a states' rights bill to the party of states' rights--Republicans have decided Wall Street's profits are more important than workers' retirement savings.

On Friday, it will be 4 weeks since President Trump took office.  Let's go back 8 years to when President Obama took office. On January 20, 2009, President Obama stood on the steps of the Capitol and asked for swift, bold action now to create good-paying jobs, to establish education for the 21st century, and the list goes on for swift, bold action now.  One week and one day later, the House passed the American Recovery[[Page H1217]]and Reinvestment One week after that, the Senate passed the bill. And on February 17, which would be Friday of this week, 4 weeks since the inauguration of President Obama, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which created or saved around 4 million jobs of the American people, stopping the loss of jobs that existed in the Bush administration. That is something that is so remarkable.  So where is the jobs bill from the Republicans? Wasn't this election about jobs? Where is their jobs bill? Where is the infrastructure bill?  By the way, President Obama also passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act even before the American Recovery and Reinvestment He also signed the SCHIP program, which had bipartisan support in the Congress and much more.

576,topic-id,2000,"Mr.President, I rise tonight to speak about the opportunity our country has to move this country forward.  I appreciate the comments by my good friend from I appreciate all the comments in this hallowed ground called the U.But I have to say that while I agree on some points, I disagree on others.  The one I am really troubled by tonight is the fact the other side is creating the ultimate shutdown in government right now. We had an election. Our democracy has worked. We have a new person in the White We have a new direction for our country. Yet this person in the White House cannot even get his team approved in the U. After some 27 days, I think President Obama had 26 of his Cabinet and other appointees already confirmed. At this point, President Trump has only 13 of his nominees. Quite frankly, had we not turned the Senate on 24/7 over the last few weeks, it would be until June or July of this year before we could get the full slate of just the 15 Cabinet officers confirmed. That is no way to run the Federal Government and, indeed, shows the hypocrisy of the other side. They complain about shut down this and shut down that. What is happening right now in the U.Senate is that the[[Page S1204]]other side is shutting down this administration from getting on with the people's business of what they elected him to do.  Today, after 8 years of failed fiscal policies that have produced the weakest recovery in 70 years, the lowest GDP growth on a per capita basis in our history, a devastating time that left 4 million women in poverty after the last 8 years and left many people struggling to get from payday to payday--after those 8 years, tonight I am actually very encouraged to finally be debating pro-growth tax ideas that can actually grow the economy and put people back to work. We now have an enormous moment of opportunity to change the direction of our country and unleash a new era of economic growth and prosperity for every  President Trump has repeatedly said that job one is growing the economy. Personally, having worked in most parts of the world in my career, I see this so differently from My perspective is that of someone who has a global business perspective, not unlike that of our I know the way forward is not complicated. We absolutely can grow this economy.  There are three things this administration is already talking about to grow the economy: One, they have said we need to deal with this archaic, outdated, and noncompetitive tax structure that we have; second, we need to push back on these arcane regulations that have sucked the very life out of our economy; third, we need to unleash the God-given energy potential that we have in our country today. The bottom line is we have to create a more level playing field generated by trade negotiations to allow us to compete on a level playing field with the rest of the world.  The first two pieces of these changes are the changes to the Tax Code and rolling back the regulatory regime. Several ideas from both President Trump and Congress have surfaced in recent days to improve our Tax Code: 1, lowering individual rates and cleaning up some of the deductions to simplify the individual code; 2, lowering the corporate tax rate to become more competitive with the rest of the world and cleaning up corporate welfare deductions that confuse the competition among players here at home and create winners and losers inadvertently; and, 3, dealing with the archaic repatriation tax. We are the last country in the world that has this tax, and it penalizes our companies for competing abroad.  These three components of changing the Tax Code will make us more competitive with the rest of the world, stimulate economic investment, and spawn a new era of economic innovation in These changes would help millions of Americans who have been crushed by this stagnant economy for much too long.  I am encouraged that today there are so many of my colleagues in Congress interested in generating new pro-growth ideas. It is a new day in  I have long been an advocate of simplifying the way we fund our Federal In my opinion, the best way to do that is ideally with a new system, like the fair tax, for example, which would move us to a totally new tax system and completely eliminate the personal, corporate, and payroll taxes we suffer through to date. I think all of these ideas need to be considered, and none should be taken off the table arbitrarily.  Having said that, one idea bears much scrutiny at this point in time, and that is the so-called border adjustment tax now being discussed in It would hammer consumers, shut down economic growth, and ultimately grow the size of government.  In the last 16 years, under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, the Federal Government has grown from $2.4 trillion in constant dollars to $3.8 trillion last year--some 60 percent growth in just two Presidencies, one Republican and one  Tax schemes similar to the border adjustment tax in Europe grew the size of those governments in Europe by more than 60 percent. That is the last thing we need to be talking about right now, after we just experienced a similar type of growth in our government over the last 16 years. Growing government with a new layer of complexity on top of our existing income tax system is the last thing we need to be doing at this point in time, when we should be talking about, How do we downsize the Federal Government, make our system more competitive with the rest of the world, create jobs, and create the atmosphere for capital formation and innovation again?  Historically, lawmakers have crammed numerous proposals into single, massive, overreaching bills. It is the Washington way. Those bills have often hurt the very people that they claim to champion. When bad ideas get mixed with good ideas, the bad ideas oftentimes become law. That is exactly what could happen here if changes to the individual code, the corporate rate, the repatriation tax, and this border adjustment tax are combined into one sweeping bill. This is exactly what Washington has historically done, and the results have been devastating.  Each of these proposals could be considered independently and evaluated on their own merits. There is no reason we can't do that. That is not possible today because many people here believe we are locked into the Washington scoring equation instead of looking at the real economic long term value of any of these ideas.  Many other countries, such as the United Kingdom, have faced these opportunities, made decisions, and acted accordingly without combining other extraneous ideas, and the results speak for themselves. Today, the United States is in the least competitive position it has been, I believe, in the last 100 years.  In the last 70 years, America has enjoyed the greatest economic miracle in the history of mankind. It was developed on the back of innovation, capital formation, and the rule of law, combined with the best workforce in the history of the world. Those are four things that America possesses uniquely, and which many other countries are working hard to emulate.  For too long, the strength of our economy has been held down by politicians in Washington and the unintended consequences that occur when they try to interfere with the free enterprise system. It is time to trust that free enterprise system to get this economy going again, and change the rules to create a more competitive environment here at home that will allow us to compete overseas on a level playing field. It is time to simplify our individual Tax Code, reduce our corporate tax rates, eliminate conflicting business tax deductions, and eliminate the repatriation tax so we can once again become competitive with the rest of the world.  In recent decades, many other countries have made these changes, and we are losing our competitive edge. Today, I am encouraged to see both Congress and the White House working together on policies that will potentially grow our economy and bring relief to businesses and families who have been crushed by improper fiscal policies that are driven by political attempts to manage our economy.  Now is exactly the time to get these changes right. We have an opportunity to change our Tax Code to a more competitive structure that doesn't pick winners and losers, that doesn't penalize people for successes, and that allows us to compete with the rest of the world on a level playing field.  I like our chances if we can accomplish that, but let's not confuse the issue with what may seem acceptable in Washington but is devastating back home to men and women who are trying to create jobs in their local economies.  We need to free up capital. We need to make sure the rule of law supports the Constitution for every The American people deserve Congress treating these issues individually and independently to generate a simplified approach to funding our government and growing our economy.  I hear the other side whine about not hearing any proposals coming out of the White Donald Trump has been talking about what he would do with the economy for the past 2 years. There is no mystery. He wants to grow the economy. Job one, he said, is growing the economy. That doesn't mean for the rich. That means for the working men and women of  I believe they have a plan. It includes adjusting our tax system, pushing back on unnecessary regulations that are sucking the very life out of our economy and, finally, once and for all,[[Page S1205]]unleashing this great energy potential that we have.  We already see moves today on some of the regulatory fronts, where we see the new Secretary of HHS issuing a new rule today. We see the new leaders that have been confirmed already taking action in this administration. I, for one, am anxious to move forward with this debate.  I applaud our compatriots in the House for bringing up these ideas. I look forward to an open and active conversation, but now is the time for the other side to begin confirming these nominees so that we can get this economy growing.  I know you also are aware that our military is in devastating shape now after 8 years of disinvestment and 15 years of war. There is enough blame to go around here. This is not about the blame game. This is about getting this economic situation right where we can fund our military so we can defend our country.  I am very concerned that the other side is putting politics in the way of solving some of these problems that we have that are so devastating to men and women who are disenfranchised in our economy and our men and women in uniform around the world who are put in danger every day because we are not funding our military the way we should.  The time for rhetoric has passed. We are already past the tipping point of the most serious, I believe, physical crisis in our history. This debt crisis is very real. We don't need to grow the economy just to grow the economy. We have to grow the economy because it is one of several steps that are absolutely mandatory to solving this debt crisis, and we will not and cannot solve our national security crisis unless and until we solve this debt crisis. I am optimistic tonight because we are beginning to talk about these very issues.  I yield my time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

When I asked Representative Mulvaney about his views during this hearing, he confirmed to me that raising the retirement age is a central piece of what he calls Social Security reform.  I could not disagree more. Michigan workers have worked their entire lives and have contributed out of their paycheck to the Social Security trust fund. I simply cannot vote for someone who takes pride in telling these Michiganders--construction workers, nurses, autoworkers--that they need to spend another 5 years on their feet after a lifetime of hard work.  Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme, and labeling it as such shows callous indifference to Michigan families. Social Security is one of the most successful programs in our Nation's history. Confirming Congressman Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and Budget is a direct threat to the financial security of millions of seniors and retirees.  If you believe Mr.Mulvaney's proposals on Social Security are wrongheaded, just wait until you hear his views on He has vowed to ``end Medicare as we know it.'' He has said the plans of House Speaker Paul Ryan, which called for drastic cuts to Medicare, didn't go far enough.  During the first term of President Reagan, a saying entered into the public discourse as the newly elected President was staffing up his administration: ``Personnel is policy.''  While President Trump said on the campaign trail that he opposes changes to Social Security and Medicare, personnel is policy. While the title of the job, ``Director of the Office of Management and Budget,'' might conjure up images of a bureaucratic backwater for many Americans, make no mistake, we are currently debating who will hold one of the most powerful positions in this new administration--and personnel is policy.  Let's be clear. Congressman Mulvaney's nomination presents a direct threat to Medicare and to Social While his positions on these critical programs are enough to warrant my ``no'' vote, let's examine how we might address other aspects of the Federal budget.  We don't need to work at the Office of Management and Budget or be an accountant to know that President Trump's budget priorities simply do not add up. The Federal debt and deficit are serious issues, but we haven't seen one serious proposal from this administration on how we reach fiscal sustainability. It is the job of the OMB Director to help bring some sense to these proposals.  What are the proposals? They include $10 trillion in tax cuts; $40 billion on a border wall--with some kind of IOU from Mexico; drastically increasing defense spending; $1 trillion on infrastructure; and a campaign promise to never, ever touch Social Security and  It simply doesn't add up. Either President Trump is planning to grow our debt and deficit to dangerous levels or he is going to ask his advisers which of his many campaign promises he should break. Given Representative Mulvaney's belief that deficits can be solved by cutting benefits for seniors and slashing investments in basic science and research, he is not the person I want in the position of OMB  This role is also not just about expenditures and revenue. As a senior member of the President's economic team, you need a steady hand to help lead the government of the world's largest economy. Given the disarray that we are now seeing in the White House, I am convinced now more than ever that Representative Mulvaney is not that steady hand to help lead fiscal policy in this  In 2013, Representative Mulvaney supported and helped lead the effort for a government shutdown. Let me repeat: He helped lead the effort to shut down the U.More specifically, he helped lead the effort to shut down the government because the Senate would not agree to defund Planned  In his confirmation hearing, he had a chance to explain this position. Our ranking member, Senator McCaskill, asked him flat out: Do you still believe that the 2013 government shutdown was good policy?  His response: Yes, ma'am. It was polite, but wrong. Polite isn't enough. We simply cannot have these views in the highest levels of government.  This spring, on April 28, funding for the Federal government expires. Critical programs, from childcare to scientific research, will halt unless there is an agreement in place. It is hard to have confidence that this administration will come to a reasonable agreement when their nominee for the highest budget position believes it is ``good policy'' to shut down the Federal  This will not be the first, or last, potential budgetary crisis the OMB Director could face. Sometime this summer, the U.Congress will need to address the debt ceiling in order to meet our previously agreed-to financial obligations. If we do not come to an agreement, the effects on the global economy will be devastating. We risk permanently downgrading our credit rating and setting off a worldwide financial crisis.  Representative Mulvaney on many occasions has doubted the need to raise the debt ceiling. He has doubted that the U.Government should meet our financial obligations. This makes me doubt his very basic qualifications to serve as the Director of  This is far beyond partisan politics. This is the fiscal health of our Nation that will be at stake--truly, the full faith and credit of the U.If Congressman Mulvaney, as the highest ranking budget official in the Nation, is not going to advocate on behalf of this commitment, who will?  I am also worried that Congressman Mulvaney simply lacks the ability to see how fiscal and financial decisions impact working people. He looks past them and doesn't give them a second thought. During his confirmation hearing, I offered Mr.Mulvaney the chance to explain why he did not pay payroll taxes for the nanny who took care of his children. To be frank, I was shocked by his response. To him, there was a ``differentiation,'' in his mind, between the employee who was spending 40 hours a week helping to raise his triplets and the employees who spent 40 hours a week in his law firm. To him, the white collar workers in his law firm were employees, and his nanny was not. I am shocked that Mr.Mulvaney did not realize that childcare is work, and it is some of the hardest, most important work there is. Whether a nanny, babysitter, or childcare provider, this employee mattered, and he looked past her and didn't give her a second thought--until he was nominated to be Director of the Office of Management and  I don't believe my colleagues should give him the opportunity to advance his extreme positions on Medicare and Social Security and look past hard-working I will oppose Representative Mulvaney's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to join me.

1422,topic-id,1141,"I thank you so much, Mr.James There can never be enough time for you to tell these stories and to educate and highlight to all of us the experiences that you have had personally, as well as the importance of Black History Month, and particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities to the fabric of the United Thank you so much, sir.  Mr.Speaker, as we have been discussing, often grassroots organizations are actually born out of necessity, not only because the system has not worked for them oftentimes, but sometimes because the system has been created, has been reorganized, or is actively fighting against them. Virgin Islanders understand the importance and the value of grassroots organizations. It is our nature and our lifeblood. We are a small people on a small island who have a history that was born out of oppression. So the very need for grassroots organizations and people who are resilient and willing to resist and fight in a passionate manner has been our very nature.  Our first experience with grassroots organizations was in 1733, on the island of John in the Virgin Islands, which is probably the first slave uprising in the Western Hemisphere where a group of 150 slaves decided that they had had enough, and those Akwamu slaves of Ghana decided that they were going to throw off the shackles and rebel and organize themselves. They were so effective at it, Mr.Speaker, that they were able to hold the island of John for 6 months against the Danish The Danes had to organize in such a manner that they brought the French and the Swiss Government to provide assistance to them. The slaves of John were quelled after that rebellion, but it took a grassroots group of organized individuals to be able to do that.  Again, on July 3 of 1848, many people don't know that the Virgin Islands became the second place in the Western Hemisphere to receive emancipation after We did that on July 3, 1848, through the work of General But what people do not know is that John Buddhoe had an enormous organizational group that plotted and planned for months before the actual staging of that uprising, which was so effective and so organized that when they went to storm the fort against an armed militia, the militia didn't realize that all of the gun powder had been taken out of the cannons and had been replaced with molasses. The slaves were so organized and so quiet and kept to themselves so much that they didn't even realize that it had been done.  The Governor of Denmark who was assigned to the Virgin Islands had to sign the emancipation on that date because he knew that this group of people were so organized that that rebellion could take the entire island out. So we received our emancipation earlier than the African Americans received theirs through that organization of grassroots.  Again, in October of 1878, the slaves had been moved not from slavery to slavery but to an organized serfdom where there were labor contracts that had to be signed. People were oppressed and living in what many here would understand as the sharecropping system but was really a serf system. Four women organized the labor rebellion at that time which we in the Virgin Islands call the They were willing to burn the islands down for just wages for themselves and laborers throughout the islands. They forced the signed contracts to have much better wage laws in them, much better terms in them for individuals. Those women were imprisoned and sent to Denmark--many of them burned at the stake for that rebellion. But it was grassroots organizations that were able to do that.  More recently, in the 1950s, there was the creation of the Virgin Islands Labor Union, the organizing of cane workers and field workers. I am proud to say that my own uncle, Raymond Plaskett, was one of the organizers of that. They were able to force the sugar plantation owners, the sugar industry, to sit down and create unionized, collective bargaining labels. But we would be remiss as a people if we kept those organizational skills to ourselves, and we brought that to the United States as well.  Many people know about Denmark Vesey who organized slave rebellions in[[Page H1350]]South He did that as a freeman, coming from the Virgin Islands and understanding that oppression anywhere of anyone was an oppression of himself, and gladly laid down his life and gave up his freedom to help organize the people of Charleston, South Carolina, that my great colleague, James Clyburn, represents to bring freedom to those individuals.  Hubert Harrison from the island of Croix was a civil rights activist. He was the mind of Pan-Africanism, along with Edward Blyden of Thomas, who gave form and shape to Marcus Garvey and his organizing of his Back-to-Africa movement.                              {time}  2115  More recently, Roy Innis, another relative of mine, was one of the leaders of CORE, the Congress of Racial Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X are people of the Caribbean who have come to the United States and recognized that grassroots organizations must be formed to push for equal rights.  The accomplishments of the civil rights movement have given us much. It created the momentum of the Civil Rights Act, Brown v. Board of Education, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ended housing discrimination, the desegregation of schools. We saw Democratic political gains and the March on  But we have organized groups still growing today, because equality has not come to its full fruition in There is still income equality, achievement gaps, poverty, unemployment, and an increase in the use of for-profit prisons that have incarcerated Black men disproportionately. Because of that, we have seen other movements now today: Black Lives Matter, founded in 2012 after the death of Trayvon Martin; Moral Mondays, which began in April 2013 by the Reverend William Barber II of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, after the Governor's mansion and the State legislature was taken over related to voting rights.  These are injustices that are continuing today, which African Americans and others are standing up for, whether it be Standing Rock or the Muslim ban. We had the March on Washington and the grassroots group Indivisible, which has grown with African Americans and others who stood with their constituents at recent townhalls to make sure that their Congressmen and -women hear their voices on all issues of importance.  Mr.Speaker, we understand that the people of the United States need to understand the importance of grassroots organizations as we end Black History This has been an outstanding time for Congress, as well as the people of America, to hear about the grassroots organizations and how they may close.

1613,topic-id,737,"Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.[[Page H1380]]  My amendment is simple. It rescinds the authority to spend up to $30 million on a commission to do what Congress and the agencies already do.  If you want duplication, look no further than this bill. It seeks to reduce the size of bureaucracy by establishing a new commission to serve a function already performed without the contribution of an additional $30 million in taxpayer funding.  Now, $30 million may not be too much to the true benefactors of this bill on K Street, but to seniors, veterans, students, and workers all across this country, it can go a long way. For example, Social Security's meager 0.3 percent cost-of-living adjustment for 2017 amounts to $4 more in benefits per month for the average beneficiary. That means that $30 million would be enough to double that cost-of-living adjustment for 7.5 million seniors.  We all know that the cost of additional sequestration cuts on education, health, and the environmental protection loom at the end of this fiscal year.  The double talk and schizophrenia of my esteemed colleagues on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee who pushed this bill through the committee has me truly concerned for the mental state of this They want to defund Planned Parenthood, but want to fund a nine-member task force at a cost of $30 million.  They drag their feet and hem and haw to assist Flint, Michigan, in funding to promote clean water and save the lives of a community, but we can sure fund a task force to duplicate already-carried-out activities by the Federal Government so we can say we did it to the tune of $30 million.  The chair of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee wouldn't allow the people of the Virgin Islands, for 100 years as part of the United States, to receive $100,000 already earmarked for our interior. But, we have money for this bill. And let's not discuss all the block-granting discussions going on around here in this  Today, the House majority is now asking to authorize $30 million on a bill that would handcuff enforcement agencies in their ability to respond to even more pressing new public health and safety problems.  Let me be clear. Reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape on small businesses is a goal that we all share. I recognize that some regulation is burdensome, and there should be a review of the code to determine what can be consolidated or repealed to reduce compliance costs.  One of the things that we seem to agree on is that retrospective review is helpful in the regulatory process. But, retrospective review is already going on with money that has already been authorized. All of the agencies have been required to do this under standing executive orders issued by President  As has been discussed before, the results have been successful in reducing regulations. Agencies have yielded billions of dollars in cost savings and reduced reporting requirements through the modification of existing regulations.  People in my district get it that there is a cost to protecting the environment, but they know that keeping our workers safe and our waters clean is worth it. There can be and is red tape that is unnecessary, and there is ongoing work and focus to eliminate and reduce that.  Could there be ways to improve upon existing review regulations? There very well may be, and I am willing to work with anyone on a good idea.  Even if $30 million were to come from elsewhere in the budget instead of additional spending, it would be that much less that agencies would have to conduct the already ongoing retrospective review process now going on.  Furthermore, we in Congress also have existing responsibility to actively conduct oversight of government operations and make legislative changes as we see fit.  There is simply no reason to spend $30 million on this messaging effort to ignore the successful work that is already going on by qualified people, and to hobble the ability of regulators to safeguard public health and safety in the process.  This Congress has money to throw at solutions in search of a problem, but requires cost offsets to provide aid for victims of Flint or toward Zika funding.  Please approve my amendment to save this money.  Mr.Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.Courtney).

7,topic-id,876,"Mr.Speaker, if you would have asked me when I first got elected to Congress, would I ever expect to be in a position, months after a Presidential election, about whether or not the integrity of that election was at stake, I would have said ``of course not.''  Our democracy's strength is that any adult has an equal say in it through their vote; that the wealthiest or the poorest, the youngest or the oldest adult, regardless of their gender, race,[[Page H1131]]religion, or sexual orientation, we all have an equal say in our democracy via our vote; which is why the vote is so important. It is the great equalizer and it gives us confidence in our government, that whoever the people select to be President should be the force of the majority.  But the concern I am speaking about today is the concern that somehow the election this past November might have been interfered with by another government.  Now, I know we have all heard about the intelligence community's classified report regarding Russian hacking and interference in our elections. I have read it and so have many of my colleagues. And, allegedly, President Trump has read the document as well.  My concern is that we seem to have different interpretations of a document that is very clear about unprecedented outside interference. For those of us who have read it, shock. Shock that another country would be so cavalier in their approach to interfere with an election, to manipulate the truth, to go farther than we have ever seen in trying to get the outcome they wanted and ultimately got.  There is no secret that President Trump has an unnerving affection for Russian President Vladimir Trump has called Putin ``very smart.'' He claimed Putin was a better leader than Barack And Trump even defended Putin in a recent interview with a FOX News talk show host.  The connections to Russia and his Cabinet are equally unnerving. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had numerous business dealings with Russia, and was even recognized by Putin with the Order of Friendship in 2013.  But it doesn't stop there. Just last week, U.investigators confirmed that parts of the 35-page intelligence dossier, compiled by a former British spy, were accurate. The dossier contained still unconfirmed details of an all-too-cozy relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Trump  Just yesterday, President Trump's own National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned after being busted for having potentially illegal conversations with the Russian Government regarding lifting sanctions on the country prior to President Trump taking office; conversations he had previously misled to the FBI and the Vice  Who else knew about Flynn, and when did they know about it?  Now, I don't bring this up as an effort to get back into a Cold War with Russia, as some seem to condone. I am disgusted by the Russian Government's scapegoating of the LGBT community and their authoritarian approach to civic affairs. I think getting back into a Cold War would be a terrible idea, and there are some areas around the globe where we could welcome cooperation to solve humanitarian crises.  My concern lies in that the Russian Government did something, hacking and interfering in our elections with the intent of electing their choice for President, Donald That must be addressed through sanctions and safeguards to make sure it never happens again.  If anyone in the executive branch is suggesting lifting any sanctions after what just happened, there needs to be a public dialogue about why, because if they read the same report that I did, there is no way that would be the appropriate response.  But given President Trump's unwillingness to accept the reality of the Russian interference in our election, given the closeness of several leading members of the President's Cabinet to Russia, and given the recent resignation of our National Security Adviser over his dealings with Russia, I feel it is imperative that the American people get all the facts.  Should we be lifting sanctions against a country our intelligence community tells us intentionally, and in multiple ways, tried to interfere with our elections and, ultimately, get the person they wanted elected? Or should we be doing even more to guarantee the sovereignty of our country and the integrity of our elections in every possible way?  Currently, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are investigating Russian interference with our elections, and I applaud them for taking the issue so seriously. Personally, I would love to see an outside, nonpartisan, independent review as well.  However, we need to take this right to the people. The classified report about election interference by the Russians could, in my opinion, with appropriate protections, be declassified so that the American people could see it for themselves.  Mr.President, I request you ask for that report to be fully declassified. If your administration's assertions are correct, let the American people see it. Let the truth come out.  But my guess is, when they see the totality of the report, there will be a lot of explaining for this administration to do, both about our response to Russia and how we protect our elections in the future.  It is really that simple. Let the people decide. Declassify the report.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1130-2.txt,2171,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,14.0,February
693,topic-id,653,"Mr.Speaker, we really should be calling this bill the ``Puppy Killing Act.''  This resolution would overturn a rule that prohibits some of the cruelest hunting practices on Federal lands in Now, again, this is not on State land. This is on Federal land that Colorado taxpayers and taxpayers across the country pay for the maintenance of and that we, the people of the country, own.  The Fish and Wildlife rule prohibits so-called predator control activities that Alaska has made legal in State law. As Mr.Huffman said, the Alaska Board of Game specifically voted to allow aerial gunning and snaring of bears. They have engaged in gassing of wolf pups in their dens. These are not theoretical matters. They are actual matters as to why this rule is so important and why I oppose it being overturned.  If this bill passes, the activities that are prevented under this rule for refuges can actually occur.  These cruel and inhumane methods that Alaska wishes to implement, including killing wolf pups and their mothers at or near their dens, killing brown bears with the use of steel-jawed traps, and scouting and shooting grizzly bears from planes and helicopters, are not only unsportsmanlike, but run counter to the directives of the National Wildlife Refuge System and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation  Thirty-one scientists submitted their support for the Alaska National Refuge Act, noting that the best available science indicates that widespread elimination of bears, coyotes, and wolves will quite unlikely make ungulate herds magically reappear. So, again, the science is clear on this matter.  There was another study by the 1997 National Academy of Sciences that found that Alaska's predator control system, including the assertion of killing wolves and bears, somehow makes other wildlife populations healthier is simply not supported by sound science.  This blunt and unscientific and inhumane approach to managing apex predators and carnivores employed by the State of Alaska is actually counter to the law and the congressional mandate regarding the National Wildlife Refuge  The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which passed overwhelmingly in this body, says it requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to:       Conserve Fish and Wildlife populations and their habitats      in their natural diversity.  How does it protect our carnivore species and the species they consume in their natural diversity if there is artificial and inhumane human intervention to kill puppies and target bears from aircraft?  It is simply unscientific, inhumane, and wrong.  In direct contrast to Federal law, Alaska has adopted regulations that require the killing of wolves and bears under so-called predation control efforts to artificially inflate game populations frequently above and beyond the carrying capacity of the land. The State currently authorizes extreme practices like aerial shooting of wolves or bears by State agency personnel, trapping of wolves by paid contractors, and using airplanes to hunt wolves and bears.  Not only is this bill inhumane and counter to our stewardship of the National Wildlife Refuge, but it is also counterproductive for jobs in the economy of Wildlife watching provides roughly five times more the revenue to the Alaskan economy than hunting or trapping. It turns out that the American people and tourists around the world would rather see these puppies and photograph them rather than shoot them and gas them.  According to the Fish and Wildlife records, wildlife viewing activities in Alaska support over $2 billion in economic activity.  Why is Congress spending time trying to allow puppy killing and cruel hunting methods to occur, instead of fair chase methods, especially when this actually undermines Alaska's economy and their ecology of Federal refuges?  Why are we repealing this rule when, in fact, most Alaskans support it?  The American people know there are more pressing issues facing the country than this rule. I urge Members to join me and vote ``no'' on the CRA and protecting puppies.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

969,topic-id,2858,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding his time.                            Opioid Epidemic  Mr.President, I rise today to talk about this issue of opioids--heroin, prescription drugs, now fentanyl--coming into our communities. It is at epidemic levels. We have worked on this issue over the last year in a bipartisan way and have made some progress. But I come today to the floor to report bad news and also to report something that Congress could do to help to address a new problem.  There was a report recently that came out by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission--very disturbing. It said that there is a new influx of what is called fentanyl coming in from This is a synthetic form of heroin. It can be up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Think about that.  The report says:       The majority of fentanyl products found in the United      States originate in Chinese law enforcement officials      have struggled to adequately regulate the thousands of      chemical and pharmaceutical facilities operating legally and      illegally in the country, leading to increased production and      export of illicit chemicals and drugs. Chinese chemical      exporters covertly ship these drugs to the Western       So that comes from an official report from this Commission on the United States and It is confirmed, unfortunately, back home. I was home this week meeting with law enforcement on They told me: Rob, the top issue in our community is now not heroin; it is fentanyl, and it is this synthetic form of heroin that is far more powerful.  At least in their minds, they think that it is also more effective at making people addicted because it is less expensive and the trafficking of it is more aggressive. So this is a big concern because we were finally, I thought, making some progress on the prescription drugs and the heroin, and now this fentanyl, Carfentanil, and U4--it goes by various names depending on the chemical compounds--are coming into our communities.  It is truly scary. The consequences are, I hope, obvious to everybody now. We are losing one American every 12 minutes. This speech will be about 12 minutes. We will lose another American to an overdose. But it is getting worse, not better. By the way, it is everywhere. Last year, in 2016, every single State in the Union had at least one forensic lab test positive for fentanyl.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of positive forensic tests for fentanyl in the United States doubled, in fact, from 2014 to 2015. We believe it is worse. We know it is worse than 2016 from the information we have. Unfortunately, even this year, this month and a half, we have seen more and more evidence of fentanyl coming into our communities.  According to the China Commission's report, the top destination for Chinese fentanyl, by the way, is my home State of We had more positive tests for fentanyl than any other By the way, Massachusetts--to my colleague who has been involved in this issue and worked on this issue and helped to try to stop the overprescribing of prescription drugs--was 2.  We are talking about 3,800 positive tests for fentanyl in Ohio alone. I do believe this is something that is being confirmed at the local level, not just from my meeting on Monday but from what I am hearing from around the Just 2 days after the Commission's report came out, in Butler County, OH, police seized $180,000 in fentanyl-laced heroin after suspected fentanyl overdoses killed five people in just 2 days.  Drug overdoses in Butler County, by the way, have nearly tripled since 2012. When I was in Dayton, I met with the Dayton R.A.N.G.E., which is a law enforcement task force--the Regional Agencies Narcotics and Gun Enforcement Task They told me that this is now their biggest problem.  They said, because it is stronger, there are more overdoses and more deaths than there are with a similar amount of heroin or the number of people using heroin. They said that just over a 2-week period, they had seized more than 40 pounds of drugs off the streets, including 6 pounds of fentanyl last week. Now, 6 pounds of fentanyl, as I do the math, is at least 20,000 doses--20,000 doses in 1 town in  I want to thank Montgomery County Sheriff Plummer, the task force, and[[Page S1249]]all of our law enforcement for their hard work to get this poison off the street. But they need our help. They need some additional tools. They told me about a 14-year-old girl who had tried fentanyl for the first time. She had never tried, apparently, any other drug. She snorted it. The people she was with had snorted drugs before, but she had not, which is one reason she not only overdosed but she died immediately. At 14 years old, her promising life was cut short.  It was in the Dayton suburb of Enon, a little more than a week ago, that a 5-year-old boy was seen running down the streets yelling: ``Mom and dad are dead. Mom and dad are dead.''  A driver saw the boy and called the police. They went to his house and found his parents. They weren't dead, fortunately, but they were unconscious. Mom was on the kitchen floor. Dad was on the living room floor. His skin had already turned blue, which is a sign of someone who overdoses and is close to death.  The first responders heroically saved both of them using Narcan--naloxone--this miracle drug that reverses the effects of an overdose. By the way, it took six doses of naloxone to revive the boy's father--a good sign, according to law enforcement, that this was not heroin but that it was heroin laced with fentanyl, something far stronger than the normal heroin--six doses.  We saw a 37-percent increase in drug overdose deaths last year in Dayton, OH, with victims as old as 87 and as young as 2 years old. Drug overdose deaths in Dayton are now on pace this year to be even more dramatic--54 deaths already in the last month and a half, which is more than any month and a half last year. Some 235 people have had their lives saved with naloxone. The Dayton Fire Department's call volume went up 17 percent compared to last January already.  So, again, it is not getting better. It is getting worse.  It is not just It is not just cities. This addiction knows no ZIP code. In suburbs, rural areas, and the inner city--it is everywhere, and, by the way, in all demographics. In Medina County, OH, in Northeast Ohio, their overdoses doubled from 2015 to 2016. In Darke County, OH, north of Dayton, a rural county, they are on pace to quadruple last year's number of drug overdoses already this year.  So why are these increases happening? One of the reasons is because of the increasing potency of these drugs on the street, particularly, again, this move from heroin to synthetic heroin that is more powerful.  Dayton paramedic David Gerstner puts it this way:       I don't want to say our overdose rate has increased      dramatically--because that doesn't even come close to      covering it . . . The potency of the drugs has increased to      the point that instead of patients needing 2 milligrams of      naloxone or 4 milligrams of naloxone or Narcan, we have had      patients who need 20 milligrams or more.  Again, it takes many, many doses of Narcan, also called naloxone, to be able to save these lives. In Darke County, which, again, is north of Dayton, Rescue Chief Brian Phillips said:       With the introduction of new illegally made synthetic      opiates [like] fentanyl and Carfentanil, heroin users are      overdosing at a more rapid rate. These derivatives are much      more potent and deadlier. The majority of our overdoses are      not breathing, and in some cases are in complete cardiac      arrest. We are also finding ourselves using more Narcan to      resuscitate these patients.  So this is the word from those who are in the trenches dealing with this every day. It is not good news. In just the first week of February, by the way, in his department in Darke County, OH, they had 12 overdose calls--in the first week of This is a town of 13,000 people.  So it is clear that these drugs are getting on the street, and they are stronger, more addictive, and more dangerous. Heroin is already addictive enough and relatively inexpensive compared to prescription drugs, which is why many people move from prescription drugs to heroin. Probably four out of five heroin addicts in Ohio started with prescription drugs, according to the experts.  But now it is being laced, this more powerful synthetic drug. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation tested 34 cases of fentanyl in 2010. In 2015, they tested 1,100--a thirtyfold increase. Last year that number doubled again to 2,400 cases. Again, they have already tested for a record breaking number this year in the last month and a half.  According to the Ohio Substance Abuse Monitoring Network, you can buy small doses of heroin and fentanyl for as little as $5 to $10 now in Southwest A lot parents and family members of those struggling with addiction worried about this, and it is very easy to see why. As the coroner in Butler County said:       Buying heroin today is like playing Russian roulette . . .      people don't know what's in the product they're going to use,      and it may not be the same [from] one use to the next.  The coroner in my home town of Cincinnati, Lakshmi Sammarco, put it like this. You buy heroin, and ``you may be gambling with your life'' because it is more dangerous than ever.  We have to get that message out there. We have not done a good job of communicating this basic message that you are gambling with your life.  Richard Marsh, Clark County coroner, says:       We're seeing a lot more fentanyl than heroin now. It      started about the middle of 2015 . . . there are all kinds of      labs producing it now and a lot of people think they're      buying heroin when in fact they're getting fentanyl, which is      fifty times as powerful.  How powerful is that? Let me give you an example. According to the DEA, or the Drug Enforcement Administration, it takes only 2 milligrams of fentanyl, about the same as a pinch of salt--think about that--to kill you. That is how powerful it is.  So again, going back to this China Commission report, they say most of these synthetic drugs are being made in labs in China and being shipped to the Western Hemisphere--to our country, to our communities.  How is it coming in? People are surprised to learn that it is coming in through the mail system. These deadly poisons are coming in through the mail system.  So unlike heroin, which primarily goes over land, primarily from Mexico, these drugs are actually coming in from Asia, from China and India, through the mail system. Unlike the private mail carriers, such as UPS or FedEx, our mail system does not require that people say where the package is coming from, what is in it, or where it is going. I think people are kind of surprised to hear that too.  That, of course, makes it is easier for the traffickers and much harder for our law enforcement to be able to deal with this problem. They cannot scan these packages that are suspect for drugs like fentanyl or other smuggled products because there are just too many packages--millions of packages. But if they had that information, if that was required on every package--electronically, in advance, digitally; this data, where it is coming from, what is in it, where it is going--our law enforcement officials tell us they would have a better shot at being able to stop this poison and being able to identify those packages.  I applaud my colleagues because with the Cures Act last year--it passed at the end of last year--we provided much more funding to our communities, to our Half a billion--$500 million--is going out to our States to be able to deal with the issue of drug treatment and recovery services. It is very important.  That $500 million, by the way, is this year and next year. That is really important to fight the epidemic. I also, of course, applaud my colleagues with regard to the legislation called CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery This provides us with not just more funding but better practices with regard to prevention, education, treatment and recovery, and providing the police with Narcan training and providing more Narcan resources to our first responders, whom we talked about.  So again, in the last year, Congress has taken some important steps forward. I commend the House and Senate for that. By the way, it was bipartisan from the start. I think that is beginning to make a difference. I wish the programs in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act could be implemented more quickly.  Unfortunately, there are still five more CARA grant programs that have yet to be implemented. Many of us pushed the last administration. Now we are pushing this administration to move quickly on that because this crisis is out there in our communities[[Page S1250]]now. We need the help. But we are getting that in place, and that is important.  But we now need to build on those efforts because of this synthetic heroin that is coming in. An obvious step to me would be to simply say that the Postal Service has to require what the private carriers require so these traffickers are not favoring the Postal Service and so we can begin to stop some of these dangerous synthetic drugs from coming into our communities, but also so that we can give law enforcement a tool to be able to target this and so that, at a minimum, we can increase the cost of this poison coming into our communities. It seems common sense to me.  Last week, Senators Klobuchar, Hassan, Rubio, and I introduced legislation called the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or STOP Act, to simply close the loophole and require the Postal Service to obtain advance electronic data on packages before they cross our borders. We just introduced it 2 days ago. It simply closes the loophole and requires the Postal Service to obtain advanced electronic data along the lines I talked about: where it is from, what is in it, where it is going.  In the House, by the way, there is companion legislation, which makes it easier to get this done because the House also understands this problem. My colleague, Congressman Pat Tiberi from Ohio, is one of the people who are focused on this issue. He is one of the cosponsors. The other cosponsor is from Massachusetts, Richie Their companion legislation will make it easier for us to get this job done.  This bill is totally bipartisan--in fact, I would call it nonpartisan. It is based on expert testimony we had before our Homeland Security Committee, where we heard directly from law enforcement. It is a simple change that would make it much easier for them to detect these packages, particularly those from these Chinese labs that the China Commission report talked about.  It is not a silver bullet. No one has that silver bullet. But our bill will take away a key tool of drug traffickers and help restrict the supply of these drugs, this poison in our community, making their price higher and making it harder to get.  With the threat of synthetic heroin growing worse and worse every day, there is an urgency to this, so today I urge my colleagues to join us in this legislation. Cosponsor it. Let's get this through the committees.  The Finance Committee will be taking up this legislation. I am on that committee. I hope we move very quickly to mark it up, get it to the floor, pass the legislation here in the Senate, combine it with the legislation that is working through the House, get it to the President's desk for signature, and begin to provide some relief to our communities from this influx of synthetic heroin that is continuing to tear our families apart, devastate our communities, and ruin lives.  This is about ensuring that young people, like the young people who are with us today, the pages on the floor, have the opportunity to pursue their dream, whatever it is. This is about ensuring that we are stepping up as a Congress to deal with a global problem. It is coming in from overseas. It is an international problem. Certainly this is one where the Congress ought to act to ensure that our U.Postal Service does the right thing to help law enforcement be able to better protect our communities.  I yield the floor.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

142,topic-id,696,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) for the exemplary act of civility in allowing me and another late-arriving colleague to be part of the freshman class presentation about our collective commitment to promoting and practicing civility both within our class and within the Congress of the United States as long as we are here.  It is a great honor to be part of the freshman class of the 115th I am thrilled to make this commitment to civility--and even friendship--across the aisle with whatever Republican colleagues are willing to hang out with a liberal constitutional law professor.  Despite my great passions as a liberal and a progressive, I dedicate myself to civility for three reasons, and I think they are all consistent with my political values and beliefs:  First, I am a middle child, and so it is in my nature to try to bring people together. If you study the theory of birth order advanced by Frank Sulloway in his great book ``Born to Rebel,'' you will find an exemplary middle child in Reverend Martin Luther King who believed in the power of love for reconciling different views in society, and you will find a theory of the effectiveness of nonviolent struggle for progress and change, a theory that doesn't try to wish away or blink away real conflict that people have but embraces conflict as the possibility for uplifting everyone in the process.  Second, I am from the great State of Maryland, one of the original middle States tucked between New England and the In Maryland, we have a habit of working across party lines for the common good. Many of the big bills that I introduced in the Maryland Senate I introduced with Republican friends, like my friend Senator David We did the medical marijuana program together. He is a fellow cancer survivor and felt very strongly about that.  I did a number of criminal justice reform measures, including abolishing mandatory minimum drug sentences, with a Republican colleague named Michael Hough in Frederick County, who lives within my congressional district.  I even introduced a bill which succeeded for fiscal transparency in government, putting up all government expenditures over $10,000 online within 48 hours, with Congressman Alex Mooney from West Virginia, although then he was a State senator in Maryland who served with me in  Third, as a law professor, I believe that all of our ideas, passions, and feelings about politics are refined, perfected, and improved through the process of political dialogue, testing, and questioning.  So I know that our Republican colleagues make us stronger on the Democratic side of the aisle, and I hope that we make them stronger, too, that we all grow together and that we are able to improve each other's ideas, change each other's minds sometimes, and work on issues of common concern like infrastructure, which I think is a pressing problem that we can gather consensus around in this body, like the environment and the perils of climate change.  Our greatest Presidents have always called us to civility. George Washington invited Americans to place our patriotic love of liberty first above partisan and sectional feeling. Thomas Jefferson said that we are all Republicans, we are all federalists at a time of great division in the country. In his first inaugural address, President Lincoln said: ``We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.''  So the bonds of affection might seem like a romantic dream given the divisions and polarization in the country today, but I do think that, if at least we start with civility and respect, maybe we will be able to attain the level of recovering the bonds of affection that should unify all of us as  The word ``party'' comes from the French word ``partie,'' a part, and we have got to remember--each of us, all of us--that our party is just one small part of the whole, and we are all here to try to advance the common good.  With that, again, I want to thank the Congressman for his very gracious offer of the time.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1167-2.txt,446,OPEN BOOK ON EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT,2017.0,14.0,February

791,topic-id,2298,"Mr.Speaker, I love magic, and I bet a lot of people out there watching today love magic, too. Ever since I was a kid, I loved the cup tricks, the card tricks, and the rabbit coming out of the hat. When I was in college, I even used to entertain at elementary school birthday parties, helping to pay my way through college.  The key move in magic, as you know, Mr.Speaker, is the sleight of hand. I looked up the definition of ``sleight of hand'' in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, which defines it as a cleverly executed deception.  A sleight of hand is also sometimes called a prestidigitation, quick fingers, or legerete de la main, which is the French phrase for ``lightness of hand.'' It is defined as the set of closely related techniques used by a stage magician to manipulate the perceptions of the audience.  Sleight of hand depends on the use of psychology, careful stage misdirection, constant blabbering, and strategic confusion to distract the audience.  Mr.Speaker, the President of the United States has been masterfully deploying sleight of hand ever since his inauguration. With his nonstop tweeting and his incessant mad antics, the President distracts us from the real action, which is what is happening here in We are witnessing a magic trick on the world's largest stage, the auditorium of American democracy. And we, the people, are the captive, bedazzled, and totally distracted audience of the The tweets are a massive sleight of hand distracting us from the serious destruction of public policy and law that is taking place right here in Congress.[[Page H1290]]                                {time}  1700  I want to say, at the outset, I prefer to think of this as a magic trick because the alternative that the President simply can't control himself is almost too horrific to contemplate.  The Constitution does have a way of dealing with that problem, too, and you can find it in the 25th  Today, we are going to assume that all of this is a magic show. I used to coach kids' soccer. And when I coached soccer, I would always tell the kids: Don't bunch. Keep your eye on the ball. Stay in your lane and pass the ball.  Without fail, the youngest kids who are just starting out, they all chase the ball. They move around the field in a big clump, a big mob. And I would say: Don't follow the mob that is following the ball. Go to where the ball is going to be going.  When they are young, they don't know how to do it.  I think that advice applies here as well to America, to the body politic. Don't follow the mob that is following the ball. Let's not be distracted full time by all the tomfoolery and tweetfoolery.  There are important and dangerous things happening right here in Congress right now. While the President is tweeting insults and fake news and inflating his slender college victory and the size of his inaugural crowd and making fun of Meryl Streep and chatting about Nordstrom's department store and talking about how he is going to make Mexico pay for his wall and so on, what is taking place in Congress is the systematic dismantling of the regulatory apparatus that the American public depends on for clean air, clean water, safe food, a decent environment, and control of criminality in the country.  The fundamental political action that we must be paying attention to now is the dismantling of the regulatory apparatus of the Federal Government, which is happening every day right here in the Halls of This is the apparatus that protects our food, our air, our water, our health care, our financial system, the ability of people to invest safely on Wall Street, occupational safety and health for our workers. All of this is being attacked in terrifying and often invisible ways.  Behind the scenes, while the wizard of odd convenes a dinner in Mar-a-Lago where he entertains a national security crisis discussion in full view of other diners who begin to tweet out and Facebook out what they are seeing happen, while all of that is happening, Congress is rolling back environmental protections to protect streams, rivers, and drinking water from pollution. They are savaging the rules that restrict the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that are leaked into the atmosphere, destabilizing our climate system. Check out H.38 and 36.  While the distractor in chief whines about leaks, while his whole campaign was based on leaks of emails that were captured by Russian agents working to get him elected, in Congress, they are rolling back financial regulations which ensure that workers have retirement savings options, H.66, and which protect consumers from excessive financial risks, H.78.  They have also targeted and rolled back labor regulations that promote safe and healthy workplaces and fair employment practices, H.37.  Amazingly, while President Trump's National Security Adviser, General Flynn, was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had been colluding with Russians to lift the sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia, here in Congress, we are passing joint resolutions to rescind anticorruption regulations that required oil and gas companies to report monetary payments that they made to foreign governments, H.41.  So Trump tweets about leaks, while his administration is one vast leak to the And here, Members of the GOP are working to throw an invisibility and secrecy cloak over corporate payments being made to foreign governments and corporations.  While the world is distracted by all of the sleight of hand, this Congress is passing bills to give government back to giant corporations and special interests that care not for the common good but simply for their own bottom line.  Mr.Speaker, as a freshman, I have been here for only 8 weeks. I have to tell you that I am disappointed that I have not voted on a single bill in the House Judiciary Committee that has had so much as a hearing. Yes, I want to repeat that. We have voted on five bills since I got here and not one of them has had a hearing.  Now, I come from the Maryland State Senate where I proudly served for 10 years as a State senator. When we had a bill coming up, no bill could be brought to the floor without a hearing first, and anybody who wanted to come testify on the bill could come testify on it. Now, that is not practicable here in the U.However, we could at least have experts relating to the bill and people who are affected by the bill come in and testify, but we haven't done that in the House Judiciary Instead, we voted on a series of bills which, to my mind, dramatically curtail the public interest.  Yesterday, we voted on a bill to dismantle, essentially to put into a stifling straightjacket, the class-action mechanism that has been used over the decades to vindicate the interest of people who are victims of sex discrimination, victims of race discrimination, victims of toxic torts, victims of asbestos poisoning. We voted basically to trash class action yesterday without even so much as a bill.  Now, on some of the other bills, it was said to me: Well, there were hearings in prior One Member said: We had a hearing on that back in 2012.  This is 2017, 5 years later. But on this particular bill that I am talking about, nobody even heard the bill. There was no hearing on it. It was simply brought up for a vote. That is irresponsible legislation. That is not real democracy when you don't even have a hearing and people who are affected by the legislation don't have the opportunity to come and talk about it.  Now, they are not having hearings because they think--and they are probably right--we're not paying attention. What are we paying attention to? We are paying attention to the magician. We are paying attention to the wizard of odd. We are paying attention to the tweets instead.  The good news is that the audience is starting to wise up. The whole country is waking up to the profound dangers of the administration's financial and political entanglements with Russia, with the Russian corporate and governmental elite.  Just this week, the National Security Adviser, Mr.Flynn, resigned after reports came out about his communications with the Russian Ambassador while President Obama was still in office, communications dealing with the lifting of sanctions on Russia, communications that General Flynn lied about and was forced from office because of it. He misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his conversations with the diplomat, which was being monitored and recorded by the intelligence community.  Now, Mr.Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, let's think about this for a moment. As a former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Mr.Flynn was no innocent about the world of spy versus spy. He must have known that his telephone call with the Russian Ambassador was being monitored and recorded. If he really wanted to go rogue and operate on his own without the permission and the license of President Trump, he never would have allowed that telephone conversation to be recorded. But he did allow it to be recorded. He made the call with presumable full knowledge that other people in the intelligence community would be listening in on it, which leads me to the inescapable, logical conclusion that Flynn knew that, in making that call, he enjoyed the full support of the one person above him who could remove him from his job, the President of the United  Now, do I know that? No, I don't know it. I surmise it. How are we going to know whether or not this is true? How do we get to the bottom of the Russian connection in the campaign? How do we get to the bottom of the Russian connection in the Trump administration?  We need to have a full, complete, independent investigation by experts, like the 9/11 Commission, which gets to the bottom of this profound danger, this dagger pointed at the throat of American democracy.[[Page H1291]]  Mr.Speaker, everybody loves magic, I think. Everybody loves the enchantment of being fooled, of being distracted, of being diverted. That is why people go to magic shows. It is diverting. It is amusing. It is fun.  Everybody loves a great magician, too. None was greater in our history than the great Houdini, who dazzled the world with his extraordinary optical illusions and effects, his amazing ability to simulate telepathy and telekinesis.  Houdini also had a very strong ethical and professional code about being a magician. He never revealed a trick. More importantly, he never tried to fool people in order to defraud them. He never tried to fool people in order to humiliate them. He never tried to fool people in order to take away their rights. He never tried to fool people in order to demoralize and crush them or to strip them of their freedom. He never tried to fool people in order to victimize them.  Indeed, in the 1920s, Mr.Houdini channeled all of his magnificent energy away from doing his magic shows and instead put it into the separate but related task of exposing psychics, mediums, con men, charlatans, and practitioners of the occult and the dark arts who did take advantage of people's good will, who did take advantage of people's impressionability to defraud them, to take their money, their belongings, and to distract them from the real world, and to undermine the moral and ethical principles that should govern human behavior and must govern social life.  Although Houdini is no longer with us, he has great heirs today in socially responsible magicians like the Amazing Randi and Penn &  Already millions of Americans themselves--millions of us in the audience--have woken up to the fact that we have been pulled into an irrational and dangerous fantasy world, an echo chamber of malignant narcissism, cruelty, and paranoia.  It is time for all of us to stop being distracted, to stop being bedazzled, and pay attention to the real game, which is, one, trying to get America to join with Vladimir Putin, a dictator and an autocrat who said that the single greatest catastrophe of the 20th century was the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in order to create an international league of dictators, demagogues, and despots to violate human rights and crush liberal democracy; and, two, to dismantle at home the public regulatory infrastructure which protects our land, our air, our water, our climate, our liberties, our freedoms, our equal rights, and our capacity to function as the greatest democracy on Earth and to function as an efficient and effective government meeting the needs of the people.  The magicians out there--there aren't many--but you have a special obligation to help us blow the whistle, and you are doing it. But it is really the American people--it is all of us who must stand up.  The Constitution talks about three branches of government. Article I is Article II is the executive. Article III is the judiciary. Let's call Congress the first branch.  But when you think about it, what is even more important than the Congress is the trunk, the roots of democracy. Everything grows up from the people. The branches are out there, but Congress works for the people. The President works for Congress and the people. The Supreme Court and the judiciary work for the people.  It is time for the people to dissolve the spells that have been cast over the country, to say this is a democracy. We operate by the Constitution and the rule of law.

795,topic-id,453,"Mr.Speaker, we should be joined momentarily by Representative Sheila Jackson I want to close out, though, my own thoughts by responding to something I have been hearing over the last week here in the Halls of  Now that it is clear from our intelligence agencies, 16 of them, including the CIA, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and so on, that Vladimir Putin had a deliberate campaign of espionage, cyber sabotage, propaganda, and fake news to undermine American democracy in the 2016 election, and now that it is clear that there were high-level contacts between Trump associates and officials of the Russian Government, it is no longer being denied by anybody on either side of the aisle. What I have started to hear is, well, sure, they tried to hack our election, and, sure, they leaked thousands of emails, and, sure, they changed the dynamics of the campaign and what people were talking about in the campaign, but there is no proof that they stuffed any ballot boxes or they hacked into the computers. And that is true; we don't know that they stuffed any ballot boxes or hacked into computers, and we will have to see if anything comes out about that when we finally get to do a real comprehensive investigation. But, Mr.Speaker, the reality is that we should be terrified and appalled and outraged that they were allowed to go as far as they did.  How many people in this body would accept a foreign entity coming into our congressional districts and spending millions or hundreds of thousands of dollars against us, hacking into our computers, releasing our emails, and completely changing the dynamics of the campaign?  So when I hear from colleagues that, well, yes, they distorted the campaign, they hacked into the campaign, but they didn't steal the election, I think that they are making a distinction with no difference at all. If you derail the campaign, you kidnap the campaign, you hijack the campaign, you have altered the outcome of the election, especially one in which your opponent gets 2.9 million votes more than you did, especially in an election where you were able to torture out only the slenderest of electoral college victories in three States by 70,000 votes.                              {time}  1730  So I simply reject the constant claim that I am hearing from colleagues, Mr.Speaker, that we don't need to worry about Russian subversion of the 2016 election because it only affected the campaign; it didn't necessarily affect the election outcome.

1368,topic-id,716,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.1033, the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice  Mr.Speaker, I want to begin by echoing the praise that the chairman offered to Mr.Collins and Mr.Cohen for their leadership on this important legislation which I support for several reasons.[[Page H1335]]  To begin with, it strengthens the Equal Access to Justice Act, a crucial law that has helped senior citizens, veterans, the disabled, and not-for-profit groups vindicate their rights against unreasonable or arbitrary governmental action.  Now, as the chairman stated, under the so-called American rule, parties to adjudicative matters typically pay their own litigation costs, subject to certain statutory exceptions; and one of these exceptions is the Equal Access to Justice Act, which allows a party to be reimbursed for litigation costs when he or she is victorious against the Federal Government under specified conditions.  But if the U.can show that its position was substantially justified, or that special circumstances would make an award unjust, then the prevailing party is not entitled to be reimbursed for his or her litigation costs.  In addition, only certain parties are eligible to be reimbursed for their litigation costs under the act, based on their net worth or tax exempt status, among other factors that are built in to the statute.  Whether these restrictions still make sense is an open question, as Congress simply does not have the adequate information to assess the continuing effectiveness of the act. This is because there has been no comprehensive Federal report on the total amount of fees awarded under the act since 1995, and, as a result, all we have is conjecture and extrapolation.  Fortunately, H.1033 addresses this problem by requiring annual reports on the amount of fees paid under the act to prevailing litigants against the government. As a result of this legislation, Congress will know now, on an annual basis, the agencies required to reimburse parties for their litigation costs; the claims that first gave rise to the litigation; and the amount of awards made under the act, as well as the basis for them.  With this information, Congress will be in a much better position to assess the ongoing implementation of the act and the performance of the agencies as litigants.  Another reason why I support this legislation is that it respects the privacy interests of the parties who are reimbursed for their litigation costs pursuant to the act. Unfortunately, prior versions of this legislation were unnecessarily intrusive.  Organizations, like the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives and the Paralyzed Veterans of America, expressed their serious concerns that prior versions of the bill might ``infringe the privacy of vulnerable people who have applied for Social Security and veterans' benefits.'' These are serious concerns, especially given the fact that the bill requires the information collected to be made available to the public and transparent through posting on the internet.  As currently drafted, however, H.1033 strikes the proper balance between encouraging transparency and respecting the legitimate privacy interests of parties that have been raised as an issue in the past. The bill specifically provides that the annual reports required to be made publicly available may not reveal any information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law or court order.  Finally, I support H.1033 because it recognizes the important role that the Administrative Conference of the United States has historically played in helping Congress identify inefficiencies among the Federal agencies and ways to save taxpayer dollars through the proper economies. I am particularly pleased that the current version of this legislation reflects various thoughtful suggestions shared by the Administrative Conference with our staffs.  Given the excellent work and scholarly analysis that have been the hallmarks of the Administrative Conference of the United States, I expect its report and its attendant findings will be an invaluable aid to  As the Judiciary Committee is the authorizing committee for the Conference, I encourage our friends on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that the Conference has adequate funding to implement this very important legislation.  Like the Administrative Conference, H.1033 requires only a modest investment that will result in a very valuable return for all Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

555,topic-id,1626,"Mr.President, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the Director of the Office of Management and Based on his appearance before the Senate Budget and Homeland Security Governmental Affairs Committees, he appears to be a smart and articulate individual, but after examining his record and his testimony, I believe he lacks the fundamental judgment to serve in this important role.  Mr.Mulvaney's tenure as a Member of Congress has been marked by symbolic stands and stunts that have been most successful in generating bipartisan opposition rather than support. Until now, it has mattered little whether his proposals have been motivated by firmly held principles or other motives. We have just been fortunate that few of Mr.Mulvaney's ideas have been made into law. However, with an appointment to a position of real authority at OMB, Mr.Mulvaney will have great power to put his ideas into practice. For that reason, it is worth reflecting on the positions he has taken.  At times of national fiscal and economic turmoil, Congressman Mulvaney could consistently be found among those stoking the flames of pandemonium in order to advance a partisan or ideological point. Indeed, he was among those Republican Members of Congress who cheered efforts to force the country to default on our financial obligations in 2011, dismissing the domestic and global alarm over Republican brinkmanship as ``fear mongering'' and as promoting a ``fabricated crisis.''  In 2013, he voted to support the Republican shutdown of the Federal Government, which ultimately cost American taxpayers $2 billion in back wages for Federal workers who were locked out of their jobs. In addition to this and other fiscal waste, the 16-day shutdown hurt the economy. Moody's estimated that it ``cut real GDP by $20 billion, shaving half a percentage point off growth in the fourth quarter [of 2013].''  In 2015, Mr.Mulvaney was part of another Republican shutdown effort. This time it was to shutter the Department of Homeland Security to protest President Obama's immigration policy. Thankfully, House Republicans relented before the shutdown took effect. Otherwise, the closure would have caused about 30,000 furloughs and about 200,000 other people, including Coast Guard personnel, TSA, ICE, Border Patrol and Customs officers, to report to work, most of them without the promise of a paycheck.  When Americans have suffered natural disasters, Mr.Mulvaney has shown himself among those who are the least sympathetic about providing Federal assistance, insisting, for example, that emergency aid for the victims of Hurricane Sandy should be offset. He has at least been consistent in this regard, since he voted against similar aid to his home State of South Of course, his opposition in that instance was mainly symbolic because it was a foregone conclusion that the bill would pass. But this should give every American pause. Mr.Mulvaney's record of supporting brinkmanship and his responses to written questions show that his first instinct will be to use any one-time emergency as an opportunity to force lasting budgetary cuts.  I am also concerned about Mr.Mulvaney's intentions with regard to the elimination of the sequester-level budget caps. In 2013, with sequester cuts on the horizon, Mr.Mulvaney ruled out revenue increases or scaling back the sequester. He said: ``We want to keep the sequester in place and take the cuts we can get.''  As the nominee to OMB director, Mr.Mulvaney now believes, like President Trump, that the sequester caps should be lifted for defense, but he has made no allowance for nondefense discretionary programs and agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Mr.Mulvaney has thus far failed to grasp that there is simply no way to secure support for sequester relief without addressing both the defense and nondefense sides of the ledger. Moreover, he has not recognized that it is repugnant to many to suggest that one side of the budget can be cannibalized to fund the other side. The best way to fund sequester relief is through the proven combination of additional revenue and reasonable cuts. It has worked before, and we should look to that solution again.  We should also reject efforts to use Overseas Contingency Operations accounts, or OCO funding, to fill the gap when it comes to defense spending. It is not a legitimate tool to fix the sequester. Despite my many disagreements with Mr.Mulvaney, this is one point where we do appear to see roughly eye to eye in terms of using the OCO for those overseas contingencies they were designed to fund.  Where we disagree most vehemently is on the matter of core programs that help Americans lift themselves up so they can participate fully in our economy and society. Although he has recently changed his position, Mr.Mulvaney, as a State legislator, voted for legislation that questioned the constitutionality of Medicaid and Social Security, and today he still questions the constitutionality of Federal involvement in education. This is more than a philosophical stand. His position will color how the administration invests in schools and students over the next 4 years. I am especially disturbed that Mr.Mulvaney is not even willing to commit to protecting funding for the Pell Grant Program and to reducing college debt, a burden faced by students and their families all across this country.  I have also been disturbed by Mr.Mulvaney's cavalier position about benefit cuts to Social Security and Medicare, by such measures as increasing the retirement age. Let's be clear. When you force a person to wait 2 or 3 more years to begin collecting the full benefits they have earned, it is a cut. If poor health or lack of job prospects forces a person to begin collecting benefits before reaching the normal retirement age, he or she will see a significant reduction in monthly benefits.  These cuts fall heaviest on the most vulnerable--low-income workers and workers in the most physically demanding jobs, those who simply cannot continue to work for another few years. We can make changes to sustain these programs without the deep cuts to benefits that Mr.Mulvaney would promote.  In this one area, I would hope the President could prevail over his staff. Many times during the campaign, President Trump promised to protect Social Security and In fact, last March he said: ``It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as it is.''  It remains to be seen how sincere the President is on this issue. Last month, he was effectively rebuffed by 49 Republicans who voted successfully to kill Senator Sanders' amendment to create a point of order that would prevent the Senate from breaking President Trump's promise that ``there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.''  Unfortunately, the President said nothing about this vote, which should lead all Americans to ask how committed he is to his promise. His choice of Mr.Mulvaney also leaves me concerned that he is not sincere about this[[Page S1177]]promise, since Mr.Mulvaney seems clearly intent on making cuts to these vital programs.  Mr.Mulvaney has also proven himself unsympathetic to the challenges facing working men and women in this country. He has sponsored legislation to bar the Federal Government from requiring project labor agreements. He has voted to repeal Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, and he has cosponsored legislation to undermine the ability of workers to collectively bargain.  Moreover, Mr.Mulvaney failed to pay more than $15,000 in unemployment and FICA taxes for a household employee between 2000 and 2004, only making good on that obligation during his nomination process. Even if this could be characterized as an oversight, it is worth noting that Mr.Mulvaney has previously proposed legislation to bar tax delinquents from serving in elected office in South Carolina and to authorize supervisors of Federal employees to take punitive action against workers who have failed to pay taxes.  One wonders how Mr.Mulvaney would feel about the fitness of a Democratic nominee with a similar challenge.  Finally, let me say a few words about Mr.Mulvaney's laissez-faire approach to regulation, particular the oversight of Wall I believe strongly that the lack of effective regulation, the lack of oversight, and the lack of appropriations for the financial regulatory agencies contributed heavily to the great recession, which is why I worked so hard to support the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  Mr.Mulvaney, not surprisingly, takes a different view. As a member of the Financial Services Committee in the House, he said: ``I don't like that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exists.'' The CFPB is a consumer-focused agency that has brought nearly $12 billion in refunds and restitution to consumers for Wall Street's abuses. This includes more than $120 million that have been returned to our military families through the efforts of the Bureau's Office of Servicemember Affairs, which I worked with Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts to establish.  Because of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, working Americans have an advocate in the consumer finance marketplace that is laser-focused on protecting them. Mr.Mulvaney would prefer to transform this agency into a paper tiger that is subject to partisan political pressure and influence from the various industries it is attempting to police. We should not allow him the chance to do that from a perch at  The country has been fortunate that House Republican leadership, with good reason, in my view, did not reward Mr.Mulvaney with a position of authority from which he could exercise real control. Unfortunately, the promotion that President Trump has offered would give him great power--power that will ultimately, I believe, be destructive in his hands. As a result, I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.  I yield the floor.

971,topic-id,1153,"Mr.President, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection President Trump has made it clear that he wants to savage environmental protections, and his administration has already started down this path of reversing some of our hard-fought progress to ensure we have a clean environment: clean water and fresh air. By nominating Mr.Pruitt, President Trump has chosen someone equally hostile to the very notion of defending our environment and our Nation's health.  Respected voices on both sides of the aisle have expressed similar alarm over Mr.Pruitt's nomination. President George Bush's former EPA Administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, who led the Agency from 2001 to 2003, stated in reference to Mr.Pruitt: ``I don't recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the Agency and the science behind what the Agency does.''  This is a sentiment I have heard from over a thousand Rhode Islanders--environmentalists, researchers, conservationists, community leaders, parents, concerned citizens--who agree that Mr.Pruitt is a troubling choice for this role. They have contacted my office to express how distressed they are that someone with Mr.Pruitt's record and background could be chosen to lead the  Last week I hosted a roundtable to hear these concerns directly from my constituents. These Rhode Islanders shared their worries about the state of our changing environment, anxiousness about Mr.Pruitt's nomination, and concerns over what they have seen so far, and fear is coming with respect to the Trump administration's approach to our environment. Nevertheless, they remain committed to ensuring that we have clean air and clean water because these natural resources are so important to our economy, our health, and our quality of life.  I share that commitment. I have consistently voted for strong environmental policies that seek to limit pollution, promote renewable energy, and mitigate the effects of climate change.  The EPA oversees the Federal Government's role in protecting our health and environment. It needs a leader who fundamentally believes in its core mission. Scott Pruitt has a record of working against the Agency's goals to protect Americans from pollution. That is the goal of the He does not believe or respect the scientific findings regarding climate change, and his close ties to the oil and gas industry are a serious concern.  These kinds of beliefs and views should be of concern to everyone in this  As Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr.Pruitt sued the EPA multiple times seeking to eliminate pollution regulations. He has a record of not only challenging the legal, scientific, and technical foundations of EPA rules, but he has also questioned the EPA's authority to issue them.  Mr.Pruitt filed as the plaintiff in these lawsuits, many of which are still pending. If confirmed as the EPA Administrator, he would be switching sides to become the defendant in these lawsuits. And yet, he has refused to recuse himself from any of these or related cases. He has also failed to provide records of his communications with fossil fuel companies during the years he served as attorney general.  It is abundantly clear that he cannot be impartial.  This lack of transparency regarding Mr.Pruitt's connections to the oil and gas industry raises serious questions about what influence these conflicts will have on his ability to enforce regulations that protect everyday Americans from pollution generated by fossil fuel use.  The EPA Administrator must be someone who will uphold and enforce Federal environmental laws impartially and honorably, with Americans' health in mind.  One issue in particular that comes to mind is one I have worked on for decades across multiple Federal agencies--lead poisoning prevention. I have long advocated for better Federal policies and more funding to protect children from lead hazards. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do much of this work, the EPA plays an important role as well.  I think we saw that very clearly over the last year with the situation in Flint,  I was deeply concerned that when asked about lead poisoning among children during his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt told the committee that he, in his own words, ``really wasn't familiar with the basic science surrounding[[Page S1251]]the health effects of lead poisoning.'' For the sake of his education on this issue--and to make all my colleagues who might not be aware of the impact--lead poisoning in children can cause serious and irreversible developmental and health problems.  We need an EPA Administrator who is familiar with and committed to protecting the health of our children from these and other kinds of environmental health hazards. Unfortunately, I do not believe Mr.Pruitt is qualified to do so.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt also displayed a lack of understanding of the role human activity plays in climate change, as well as a disregard for the scientists who have spent their lives studying and carefully observing our Earth's changing climate.  Our next EPA Administrator should understand the threat of climate change and base the Agency's policies on scientific data and findings without ideological influence. Many people across the Nation were distressed and deeply concerned by the removal of climate change reports from the EPA's website shortly after President Trump took office. I share that concern, and I am disturbed that the EPA has recently put a hold on issuing new grants and instituted a gag order on all communications.  This is alarming. The halting of Federal funds means that our investments in our water infrastructure, remediation of our watersheds, and support for numerous others environmental initiatives so vital to our local communities and States will be affected, and this will seriously harm environmental protection efforts. In Rhode Island, these cuts could have devastating effects, such as hindering the State's ability to provide clean air and clean drinking water for all residents.  We need an EPA Administrator who is committed to safeguarding clean water and clean air and who is experienced in environmental protection. This role demands someone who is prepared to preserve and defend our environment from harm, who can make decisions based on scientific evidence, and whose financial ties will not impact his decisions when it comes to protecting the American public from pollution.  Scott Pruitt is not the EPA Administrator we need. The nature of the lawsuits he filed attempting to dismantle EPA regulations that protect clean air and water--the very regulations he would be charged with enforcing--demonstrates that he is not committed to defending our natural resources, our health, and our well-being. Mr.Pruitt, in my estimate, is unsuited and unqualified for this critical leadership position.  For these reasons, I cannot support his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.

As the director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Major General Nichols' undeterred leadership, soldier-scholar depth and breadth of knowledge, commitment to eliminating sexual assault, and commonsense approach to problem solving have contributed immeasurably to the improvement and execution of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program and the DOD-wide strategy. She also spearheaded specialized policies and strategies focusing on prevention efforts, combating retaliation, and addressing the needs of male victims.

1411,topic-id,1469,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague, Stacey Plaskett from the Virgin Islands, for taking this assignment and making sure that the Congressional Black Caucus continues its conversation with America, and to inform people on issues that are important to us, and also reflecting on how important African-American history is, not just to us, but to this country.  It is African-American history that made this country great in the first place. How our civil rights groups and people of the same kind, not necessarily the same color, came together to make this a more perfect union.  So today what I wanted to do was actually talk about some of the civil rights organizations that changed this country, made it better, made it possible for me to be here, and compare and talk about some of the movements that we see today that are making some of the same differences for the next generation. It is just a shame that in 2017 we are still fighting the same fights we fought 50 years ago for voting rights, for equality, and all of those things.  So when I say I want to talk about some of those organizations, I want to talk about organizations like SCLC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; or CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality; or SNCC, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating They all played an important role in launching grassroots movements that succeeded in ensuring more equality for African  Sit-ins, bus boycotts, marches, voter registration drives, and other protests--these grassroots movements spread across the South, including my home State of  Let's just talk about one specific incident. September 9, 1960, the Woolworth store lunch counter in New Orleans closed early.  What was the reason?  Seven members of the Congress of Racial Equality, five Black students and two White students, decided to hold a sit-in demonstration to protest Jim This was the first-ever sit-in in the city.  The seven students were like so many other students across the South at the time who were using nonviolent action to change the country. In fact, let me read their names because many of them I knew.  In fact, one, Jerome Smith, who was a Southern University student the year before, is actually still on the battlefield in Louisiana not only coaching Little League, but fighting for criminal justice reform and financial and economic equality.  You also had Rudy Lombard from Xavier University, a freedom fighter; Archie Allen from Dillard University; Bill Harrell from Tulane; William Harper, who was at LSU; Hugh Murray, who was also at Tulane; and Joyce Taylor, who intended to enroll at Southern  Fortunately, unlike others who held sit-ins, these seven Southern students didn't have milkshakes thrown on them. They were not beaten or bloodied. The seven students sat down at 10:30. Six police officers were on hand to keep the peace and did not try to remove the students. The students sat there determined for 2 hours.  Because of the demonstration, Woolworth blinked first. They decided to close early that day and they closed at 12:30, after the students had sat there for 2 hours.  These seven students and so many other civil rights activists are the shoulders on which we all stand. Unfortunately, the fight for equality is not over. We see this most clearly when we look at our criminal justice system. To date, the organization Black Lives Matter has launched a grassroots movement that has succeeded in exposing police brutality and making it front-page news.  The movement began in 2012, after the death of Trayvon Martin, who was killed by a neighborhood watchman on February 26, 2012. I would be remiss if I did not mention that yesterday was the fifth anniversary of Trayvon Martin's death.  Black Lives Matter is focused on all of the ways Black people are disempowered by the State, including police brutality. In addition to exposing police brutality and making it front-page news, Black Lives Matter, like the organizations during the civil rights movement, has attracted a diverse coalition of supporters.  The reality is not lost on African As I mentioned before, two of the protesters who sat in at the Woolworth store in Louisiana were If you go back to Philadelphia, Mississippi, where they found the three bodies of the civil rights workers who were registering people to vote, you saw Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner--one African American and two White Americans--who stuck together fighting in justice.  King said so eloquently: ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''  So as we talk about our organizations like SNCC, CORE, and SCLC, and we talk about Black Lives Matter, it reminds me of the time when King was sitting in the Birmingham jail, and seven--eight White religious leaders in the South criticized King, asking: Why he couldn't wait. Why did he have to force the issue? And why, as an outsider, he was down in Birmingham?  King responded and initially said: ``I don't usually answer criticism because I would be doing it all day, but because I believe you to be eight men of goodwill, I will take the time to answer.''  I just want to read you an excerpt of his answer because I think it is so appropriate when we think of our groups that are coming up now.  He said: ``I think I should give the reason for my being in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the argument of `outsiders coming in.' I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every Southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.''  It then goes on to say: ``So I am here, along with several members of my staff, because we were invited here. I am here because I have basic organizational ties here.''  Then he goes on to say: ``Beyond this, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the eighth-century prophets left their little villages and carried their `thus saith the Lord' far beyond the boundaries of their hometowns; and just as the Apostle Paul left his little village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to practically every hamlet and city of the Greco-Roman world, I too am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular hometown. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.''  So when you think of Black Lives Matter and other protests, the first comment is: We are outside agitators; why are they here?  They are here because injustice is here. So all marginalized groups must stand together in the fight against injustice. This was important during the civil rights movement and it is important now.  In that spirit, African Americans fully recognize the importance of not only joining movements in support of their rights, but also joining movements in support of the rights of others.  Standing Rock: Most recently, African Americans and others have stood with Native Americans at Standing Rock to protest the Dakota Access pipeline.  The Muslim ban: We have stood with the Muslim community to protest the Trump administration's controversial Muslim ban.  Then there was the Women's March, which was led by a diverse coalition of organizers and attracted millions of protesters across the Nation and the world to protest sexism and other gender issues. African Americans participated in the march, including several members of the Congressional Black  Then we can talk about indivisible. African Americans and others have stood with their fellow constituents at recent townhalls to make sure that their Congressman or Congresswoman hears their voices on the Affordable Care Act and other issues. Some of[[Page H1346]]these exercises in civic participation have been inspired by the guidebook ``Indivisible,'' which, as the authors state, provides best practices on getting elected officials to listen.  Then there is Moral Mondays with Reverend William It began in 2013 after the Republicans took over the Governor's mansion and State legislature in the Tar Heel State for the first time in more than a century. On what was supposed to be the first and only Monday protest, Barber led a small group of clergy and activists to the State legislature to protest the State Republicans' efforts to block Medicaid expansion, cut unemployment benefits, and roll back voting rights. The next Monday, hundreds of protesters showed up, and hundreds soon became thousands. These protests became known as Moral Mondays, and they eventually spread across the  So let me just say that from SCLC to SNCC, to CORE, to ``Indivisible,'' to Moral Mondays and Reverend Barber, to Black Lives Matter, people of like mind that fight for justice come together. And that, we learned from the civil rights movement, and that is our contribution to date to Black History Month and celebrating that civil protests and civil disobedience can change and make this a more perfect union.

717,topic-id,324,"Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.43. Congress must use its authority to strike this rule and stop the Federal Government from forcing States to funnel taxpayer money to abortion providers.  This rule is wrong on process and it is wrong on policy. First of all, States have every right to put in place reasonable guidelines for how their Federal dollars are spent. For Washington to attempt to coerce States in this way would be bad enough, but for unelected bureaucrats in the Department of Health and Human Services to go around Congress at the eleventh hour of the Obama administration is just outrageous.  Madam Speaker, I think we all agree that low-income women should have access to essential title X services, but why is it necessary for those services to be funded at the Nation's largest provider of abortion? It isn't, of course, but the abortion industry and its supporters want us to believe that it is.  When it comes to funding, they like to pretend that abortion doesn't exist and that Planned Parenthood is the only place where women can get health care, but that is not true. The truth is that there are more than 13,000 federally qualified and rural health centers that offer low-cost health care to women. These centers outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics 20 to 1; they just don't preform abortions.  Understanding this, some States have rightly enacted laws and policies redirecting title X dollars away from abortion providers and toward these noncontroversial clinics. If the true goal here were to ensure women's health care, no one should have a problem with that. But that wasn't the goal, and everybody knows it.  There is a reason people call this rule President Obama's parting gift to Planned It was a blatant, transparent attempt to preserve the[[Page H1271]]pipeline of funding to the Nation's largest abortion business.

You know, some time ago, when I first got involved in this political processing, I made it known that I felt that the silent killer of American business was the regulatory regime that we have in place, where over 50 years this Congress has ceded its authority to unelectable, unaccountable bureaucrats. Today we have 175,000 pages in the Code of Federal Register that is evidence of that. It is time that we, as a Congress, on behalf of our constituency, on behalf of the future well-being of this country, take back that authority with oversight and accountability through this SCRUB  It has been said that there is approximately, on average, $20,000 a year per employee of a manufacturer that is attributable just to compliance with regulation. We need to make sure that we have our manufacturers, our businesses, doing that which they do best within a reasonable regulatory scheme, and that is what this act offers: a reasonable regulatory scheme that allows Congress who has the authority--actually has the only authority--to hold accountable these unelectable bureaucrats. The SCRUB Act will allow us to do that.  It will allow due process through a discovery process. More importantly, the review board, the commission, the five bipartisan members who are appointed by the President must be confirmed by the This, in and of itself, is a sense of due process, a sense of accountability, and, more importantly, a strong sense of purpose that the American people would want to see this Congress be able to go in and take back the authority that they have delegated--at sometimes recklessly--to these bureaucratic organizations.  We talk about the $30 million. I know the $30 million is always big in any equation that you have, but when you allow the $30 million to be spent over 5 years and you allow that to have the removal of certain regulations, you will pay for this $30 million 10 times over in no time at all.

This commonsense amendment ensures the impacts of public health, including the costs and benefits associated with those impacts, are considered under processes established by the SCRUB This, I believe, is a reasonable improvement to the bill. It ensures that Federal agencies appropriately consider the true costs and benefits of Federal rules with an eye towards saving hard-earned taxpayer money.

In many of our most disadvantaged communities, fewer resources are available to benefit health outcomes that are clearly seen in the levels of chronic illness in these communities and shorter life expectancies. It doesn't take a genius to connect the dots of government policies on public health in our economy.  If the goal of this legislation is eliminating existing regulations to pay for new regulations, doesn't it make business sense to understand the impacts of these decisions on our Nation's public health? For example, eliminating the Department of Labor's silica rule might save an employer the expense of[[Page H1378]]purchasing mitigation equipment, but does that employer truly save money if his health insurance premiums go up due to associated respiratory illness?  When the majority pushed to eliminate the Department of the Interior's stream protection rule, thereby allowing mountaintop mining companies to dump potentially toxic mining debris in nearby streams, there was little consideration to the costs associated with mitigating the inevitable drinking water contamination and healthcare costs of those who will be sickened after drinking contaminated water.  This amendment ensures that Federal agencies, at the very least, consider the health impacts and costs associated with eliminating a regulation. This amendment will help to go a long way in preventing unnecessary healthcare costs, which I hope we can agree is a positive improvement to the bill.

If the goal of this legislation is to eliminate existing regulations to pay for new regulations, doesn't it make business sense to understand the impacts of those decisions on public health?  For example, eliminating the Department of Labor's Silica Rule might save an employer the expense of purchasing mitigation equipment, but does that employer truly save money if his health insurance premiums go up due to associated respiratory illness?  When the Majority pushed to eliminate the Interior Department's Stream Protection rule, thereby allowing mountaintop mining companies to dump potentially toxic mining debris in nearby streams, there was little consideration to the costs associated with mitigating the inevitable drinking water contamination and health care costs of those who will be sickened after drinking contaminated water.  This amendment ensures that federal agencies, at the very least, consider the health impacts and costs associated with eliminating a regulation. This effort will go a long way in preventing unnecessary health care costs, which I hope we can agree is a positive improvement to the bill.  If my colleagues across the aisle insist on eliminating federal regulations, it only makes sense to ensure that removing such rules does not harm the public.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``YES'' on this commonsense amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1370.txt,2003,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,28.0,February

1607,topic-id,351,"Madam Chair, this commission that we have here in the SCRUB Act is established to clear out old and unnecessary regulations. It currently requires the commission to consider whether the rule could be repealed without significant adverse effects, whether the rule is unnecessary, whether the costs are justified by the benefits, and certain other criteria.  I think that the consideration of public health certainly fits within whether the rule would have significant adverse effects, whether it is necessary, and whether the benefits justify the cost. Health, safety, and welfare of the American people is foremost to what we do, and I laud my colleague from California for filing this amendment.  This amendment clarifies that the commission should consider the impact on public health of repealing any regulation. I think that, again, my colleague from California gave fine examples of that particular balance.  We agree that we want regulations that are necessary to protect public health. I am excited to see one of my Democratic colleagues working with us to improve regulatory reform legislation. I look forward to future opportunities to continue this work.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Madam Chair, I look forward to, in the future, working on true bipartisan regulation. I think it is one of those areas, at least in my experience in local and State government, that we should be working in a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, this bill I do not believe accomplishes that.  So regulatory oversight is probably the most important thing we could do, and I hope that we can do it in a bipartisan way in the future. I would encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.

1617,topic-id,262,"Mr.Chairman, the commission is permitted, under this bill, to spend $30 million over 5 years for administrative purposes. By removing the funding in this amendment, the commission will not be able to hire staff, rent office space, establish the public website as required in the bill, or hold the public meetings, which are also required in the bill. This amendment essentially guts the bill.  The commission established under this bill has a momentous job ahead of it. The Code of Federal Regulations totals more than 178,000 pages. This is approximately 36,000 pages of regulations for review every year of the 5 years the commission has to conduct its work.  But it is not just simply reading the pages. There is work behind understanding whether the regulations are effective. There is outreach and public hearings to understand how the regulations are or aren't effective.  I believe the savings from eliminating unnecessary costs and the improved efficiency from weeding out unneeded regulations will far outweigh the resources applied to this effort.  The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that regulations impose a cost on the economy of $1.8 trillion. Who bears that cost but the consumers? This amendment would gut the bill. $30 million over 5 years is more than reasonable, considering the economic impact that these regulations have had on the American business and the American economy.

Amendment 5 Offered by Mr.McNerney  The Acting It is now in order to consider amendment 5 printed in House Report 115-20.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Page 31, line 17, insert after ``Code'' the following: ``,      except that the term does not include any rule relating to      the physical and cyber security of the bulk-power system (as      defined in section 215(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.     824o(a)), including any emergency action to protect and      restore reliability of the bulk-power system''.  The Acting Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from California (Mr.McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It exempts from the bill any agency rule relating to the physical and cybersecurity of the bulk power system, including any emergency action to protect and restore reliability. The bulk power system is comprised of facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electrical transmission network to maintain reliability.  Our Nation's electrical system touches each and every part of our lives, hospitals, schools, transportation, homes, businesses, and our national security. Our electrical system is the central element of our Nation's critical infrastructure because all other components of our infrastructure depend on it.  The electrical system is composed of 640,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and more than 6 million miles of distribution lines. This network is undergoing a transformation. There are an ever-increasing number of devices that are connected to the grid; technological advancements are allowing for efficiencies and cheaper production of power, whether it is renewable energy or natural gas; and consumers have more choices and more control. With increased digitization, automation and interaction also have enhanced grid flexibility and security.  While these developments present tremendous opportunities, such as new jobs and reducing carbon emissions, they also pose additional physical and cyber threats to the transmission and distribution systems. Stakeholders across the system are facing numerous new threats and challenges in detecting problems, responding to intrusions, and keeping rates affordable while maintaining reliability. The long-term health of the electricity sector is now, more than ever, a shared responsibility between communities, consumers, industry, and government.  Despite these challenges, the bulk power system is an example of industry stakeholders and the Federal Government working well together, when needed, and working independently, when needed and succeeding.  Transmission and distribution providers have taken it upon themselves to establish industry-led standards, best practices, and supply chain management when it comes to grid security. They have worked well with NERC and FERC in developing Critical Infrastructure Protection standards for the bulk power system.  These Critical Infrastructure Protection standards cover critical cyber asset identification, security management, personnel and training, electronic security, physical security, systems security, incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans. There are 72 inactive CIP standards, and 11 that are now subject to enforcement. These standards aren't always perfect, but they do represent compromise and collaboration.  A well-protected and reliable grid makes economic sense. Power outages and disturbances can cost more than $180 billion annually, and data suggests that electrical system outages attributable to weather-related events are increasing, costing the U.economy an estimated $20 billion to $55 billion annually. Electric companies are projected to spend more than $7 billion of their own money on cybersecurity alone by the year 2020, and are expected to invest nearly $53 billion to enhance the grid.                              {time}  1530  These are significant investments, but essential investments as well. A more resilient, secure electric sector is something we all benefit from. It will continue to require investments at all levels, including from the Federal  We should enhance funding for our national laboratories that have partnered together via the Grid Modernization Lab We should provide high levels of funding for the Office of Electricity and its mission to ensure the energy delivery system is more secure, resilient, and reliable. We must promote R&D that helps bring new, innovative technologies to the grid.  We will always struggle to keep ahead of those bad actors who are seeking to attack us, but we can establish metrics, procedures, and technological capabilities that allow us to respond and adapt.  I agree with many of my colleagues that we should work to identify and remove regulations that are no longer relevant. The Critical Infrastructure Protection standards have worked. My amendment ensures that Federal agencies will have the flexibility needed to respond to challenges without sacrificing any other necessary protections.  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1370.txt,2003,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,28.0,February

Clint is a former Member of the U.House of Representatives, the South Dakota State Senate, and a former South Dakota secretary of agriculture. He helped give birth to the Conservation Reserve and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, which have been extremely beneficial to farmers, ranchers, and landowners, not only in South Dakota but across the country. These programs helped increase farm and ranch family incomes at a time of great economic turmoil.  But more importantly, Clint was a mentor and a hero to me and to many others and, I am proud to say, a lifelong friend to me and I have always looked up to Clint and sought him out for advice.  I first met Clint when I was an intern in the South Dakota State Senate in 1976. He was serving in a leadership position.

He also is credited with introducing me to that exquisite combination of water and Scotch over 40 years ago at the Kings Inn in  Clint grew up on a ranch near Presho, SD, in Lyman County, and never let go of his cowboy roots, his hat, or his boots. He was an iconic symbol of a cowboy and of the Wild West, so much so that he was one of the finalists to be the ``Marlboro Man'' in the mid-1970s. He also appeared in minor roles in films and even in a Super Bowl commercial.  But even off camera, he was a cowboy through and through. He was down to earth, a straight shooter, and a practical conservative who believed in freedom and helping those in need. He was also a problem-solver who fixed what was wrong instead of just talking about it.  He was one of the true conservationists in South Dakota, promoting wildlife and conservation on his operating farm and ranch. He taught many the importance of the CRP, or the Conservation Reserve Program, and preserving our natural resources. During pheasant hunting season, he always opened his ranch to hunters, and loved making his secret recipe for chili for all to enjoy. But most of all, he understood the importance of family. He was a great husband to Bev, a father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, and he was a great friend to all who knew him. He had a tremendously positive impact on the many thousands of people whom he met and touched with his kindness, selflessness, and generosity. South Dakota is truly a better State, and we are a better people because of his hard work and dedication to making things better.

Let me back up and tell you what I think I hear--that most people hear around here as well from a lot of people. This has been going on for a long time. I don't blame people because people have real lives, businesses to run, and families to raise so they are not watching the Federal budget, line by line, on a regular basis.  There is a perception out there that the U.Government spends an extraordinary percentage of our overall[[Page S1470]]budget on foreign aid. I saw a poll recently, a legitimate poll conducted, and it asked people: How much of the Federal budget do you think goes out of the country? And the average was 26 percent. That is what people thought. Of course the truth is, it is nothing even close to that.  I want to begin by saying that today foreign aid as a part of our overall budget is less than 1 percent of the total amount the U.Government spends--less than 1 percent. The second thing people bring up is: Well, but we have so many problems in We do. We have real issues we need to confront. Why do we spend so much money on these other countries when we have so many problems here at home? That is a legitimate question. People should ask that. I think it is important for those of us who believe in global engagement and believe in the function of foreign aid to justify it, to never take it for granted, and to constantly examine it to make sure the money is being spent well and that it is worth spending at all. That is what I wanted to come to the floor to do today for a few minutes.  I know we are soon going to end a budget cycle. There will be debate, and every dollar in the budget should justify itself. I want to explain for a moment why I believe global engagement and foreign aid are so critical.  Here is the first reason. The world has always been interconnected, especially for We are not a small, obscure nation. We are the most influential, the most consequential nation on the planet. I can tell you that almost without exception, if there is a major crisis anywhere on this planet, it will eventually have a nexus to life in America in one way or another.  You think about one of the controversial issues that has been debated in Washington and being discussed politically is the Syrian refugees. I remember a couple of years ago that people would tell me: Well, it is very sad what is happening in Syria, but what does that have to do with us? Well, 2 or 3 years later, I think we all know the answer; that is, when refugees are created anywhere in the world, it is natural that a significant percentage of them want to come to the richest, freest, safest nation in the world, and that is the United States of  It also impacts our allies. We have seen it in Europe where a tremendous strain has been placed upon our allies in A significant amount of the budget in Germany, where I was recently just visiting, is being spent on dealing with the refugee crisis and the impact it is having on them. I would tell you that what happens in the world has a direct consequence to the United  Here is another fact for why it matters to This is a key fact that I was able to pull up today--or my staff was. Twelve of the fifteen top trading partners of the United States were once recipients of U.foreign assistance.  I think the best way to justify foreign assistance is to understand the history of it. Let's go back in time. Let's go to the end of the Second World Europe was in ruins. Japan was in ruins. The United States, had it behaved like most great powers in history, would have either abandoned those nations itself or the United States would have conquered them and made Japan a colony or made Germany a dependent on the United Instead, through the Marshall Plan the United States rebuilt Western Europe and in particular Through additional assistance, the United States provided aid to rebuild post-war For the Japanese, between 1946 and 1952, the United States invested $2.2 billion--or $18 billion in today's dollars--in Japan's reconstruction efforts. That amounts to more than one-third of the $65 billion in goods the United States exported to Japan just last year, in 1 year alone.  What is the result of this aid? Here is the result. Today we have a prosperous, unified Germany, which is a strong member of NATO and a strong ally of the United We have in Japan the world's third largest economy and one of the most important allies of this great country of ours in the Asia-Pacific region. This would not have been possible without U.assistance. Did it help the people of Japan and the people of Germany? Did it help the people of the United States? Without question.  Is the world a better place today because Germany is a free democratic nation involved in trade, involved in alliances with us, deploying troops around the world for NATO missions? Without a doubt. Is the world a better place because Japan is the third largest economy and a strong ally of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region? Without a doubt. That is an example of the fruit of U.engagement.  Some would say to me: Well, that was after the Second World That was a catastrophic event, but as a matter of course, what else has borne fruit? Isn't this just money we throw down a hole and never see results of? I would tell you that is not the case.  I would point to South It is hard to believe, but just a few decades ago South Korea was poorer than North South Korea had less money, less of an economy, less prosperity than North Today, South Korea is an industrialized, fully developed economy--one of the largest economies in the world. A nation that not long ago was a military dictatorship is now a vibrant, functioning democracy and a strong American ally.  Again, another example--do you want one in our own hemisphere? Look at the country of Not long ago, Colombia was basically a failed state. That country had been overrun by drug gangs, the cartels--the Medellin Cartel, the Cali The government was on the verge of collapse. Presidential candidates were being assassinated--an extraordinary source of instability in the Western Colombia still has challenges, but in helping them move forward with Plan Colombia, today trade between the United States and Colombia is at $14 billion, and as of last year, it actually was a surplus.  What is more, Colombia is now a force multiplier for our cousins. For example, if you visit Honduras, as I did during the summer, and you see the Honduran police and the Honduran special forces being trained to take on the criminal elements and cartels in that country, do you know who is there training them alongside of our people? The Colombians--the Colombian military units who have the same uniform, the same training, the same weaponry, and the same practices as the Green Berets of the United States, and they are a force multiplier. Today, Colombia is doing the things America once had to do because of the aid we provided them, and they are perhaps our strongest ally in the Western  It goes on and on from a human perspective. You think about America and America's Feed the Future It is an initiative that has trained thousands of farmers in Tanzania over the last decade. Now our country exports to them, and exports to Tanzania from the United States have increased by 500 percent.  An important point, by the way, is that there have been reductions in foreign aid over the last few decades. Today, we spend 50 percent less on foreign aid than we did as a percentage of our gross domestic product when President Reagan was in office, which was near the end of the Cold There is rationale for this, as well, for our economy and for our national security.  From an economic perspective, 95 percent of the consumers in the world--95 percent of the people on this planet who buy things--live outside of the United Seven of the ten fastest growing economies happen to be in the developing world. So if you are an American company that makes things--and I know we want to make things in America again--you have to sell them to someone. If you can only sell them to 5 percent of the world's population that happens to live in the United States of America, that is one thing, but imagine how much more you could sell, how much more money you could make, how much more value you would have for your shareholders, how many more employees and jobs you would create if you could sell to more of that 95 percent of the people around the world. You cannot sell to people and people cannot be consumers if they are starving. They cannot be consumers if they are dying of HIV/They cannot be consumers if they are dying of malaria. They cannot be consumers if they live in an unstable country.  So there is an economic rationale for our investment around the world. We[[Page S1471]]are helping people to emerge from poverty and to ultimately become members of a global consumer class that buys American goods and services. We are, in essence, planting the seeds for markets to develop that we can trade with and that we can sell to. That is one of the reasons it is so important. That is one of the reasons that today one out of five American jobs is tied to international trade and that one in three manufacturing jobs in America is tied to exports. You cannot export unless there are people on the other end of the deal to buy it from you, and we want as many people in the world as possible to be able to afford to buy things from us. In many places around the world, it begins by ensuring that they are alive and then by ensuring that they have the education they need to develop an economy so that their people can become consumers and trade partners with us.  The list goes on and on in terms of the accomplishments it has had.  Our global anti-malaria program has saved over 6 million lives, primarily those of children under the age of 5. PEPFAR, which is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, has saved more than 11 million people and has prevented 2 million babies from being born with The number of school-age children worldwide who are not going to primary school dropped to 57 million children in the year 2015. That is still too many, but the number was nearly twice that--100 million--just 7 years ago. There has been a 99-percent reduction in polio cases thanks to the efforts we have led in the vaccination program. The list goes on and on.  There is a national security component to this, and here it is: Imagine for a moment that you are a child born in Africa, that your parents had HIV, and that they survived because of American assistance. Imagine if you yourself were someone who survived HIV or malaria because of American assistance or that you got to go to school because of American help or that because of American assistance you didn't contract polio the way your relatives used to. Imagine if you were one of these young people around the world whose lives are better because of the help of the American taxpayer. This is never going to be 100 percent for sure, but I promise you it is going to be a lot harder to recruit someone to anti-Americanism and anti-American terrorism if the United States of America is the reason one is even alive today. That is the national security component, apart from allowing countries to become more stable and provide for their people and for themselves.  By the way, when we talk about the international affairs budget, it is not just foreign aid; it is everything--diplomatic relationships with the global community, security assistance with key allies--As an example, it provides them $3 billion in military assistance as they are a key ally in a strategic part of the world.  We have talked about the health clinics in the schools and the humanitarian relief efforts. I remember going to the Philippines about 3 or 4 years ago. One of the first things people mentioned to me was that after that horrible storm that killed and hurt so many people, they woke up one morning and saw a U.aircraft carrier off the horizon, and they knew things were going to be better because America was on the case. Think about the power and what that means for our Nation and the impact it has on people around the world. This is part of it.  By the way, when we travel abroad--when you are an American and you are in another country and you lose your passport or your wallet gets stolen or you have any sort of an issue--you have to work abroad, as do many people whom I know, and we get the calls in our office from people who have kids who are studying abroad and have an issue and have to go to the consulate or the Embassy--this is the budget that pays for that stuff. This is the budget that pays for that.  If you are a company that decides ``I want to do business in this new country. I want to fly to this country and find some customers and maybe come back to America and hire 20 more people so that we can build products to sell. I want to expand our reach,'' it is our U.Embassies and the agencies working within them that are helping to make those connections for American businesses. That is part of this budget.  When we talk about this, I think it is critical for us as leaders to explain to the American people just exactly what it is we are talking about. We always want to put America first. We always want to think about the American people first. That is our obligation. But I think this is part of that. If you really want to help the American people, you have to ensure that the world we live in is a more stable place.  I close by saying that this always gets back to the argument that some make: Why does it have to be us? We have been doing this for so long. We have been involved in this for so long, and we have spent so much money and so much blood and treasure around the world for the cause of freedom, democracy, humanitarianism, and the like. Why does it have to be America?  I think that gets to the fundamental question of, what kind of country do we want to be? The choice before us is that it has to be America because there is no alternative. That is the point I hope people remember and understand. There is no alternative for America in the world today. If America decides to withdraw from the world, if America decides to step back, if America declines and our influence around the world becomes less palpable, what will replace it?  There are only two things that can replace it--not the U.There are only two things that can step into whatever America leaves if it steps back. 1 is totalitarianism. For the growing movement around the world led by China and Russia and North Korea and Iran, it is the totalitarian regimes. That is the first thing that can step in and fill the vacuum. The other is nothing. The other alternative to America is nothing. It is a vacuum, and that vacuum leads to instability, and that instability will lead to violence, and that violence will lead to war. That will ultimately come back and impact us whether we want it to or not. This is the choice before us.  Without a doubt, I am the sponsor of a law that we passed last year, foreign aid accountability. I want to make sure that every dollar of American taxpayer money that is invested abroad for these purposes is spent well and is not going to line the pockets of corrupt dictators. I 100 percent agree with that. Yet this idea that somehow we can just retreat from our engagement in the world is bad for national security, it is bad for our economy, and it isn't good for policymakers who want to put the American people first. By the way, it doesn't live up to the standards of who we are as a people.  I have said this many times before, and in this I am guided by my faith. I believe that to whom much is given, much is expected. That is what the ancient words and Scripture teach us. I think that principle is true for people, and I think that principle is true for nations. I believe in the depth of my heart that our Creator has honored America's willingness to step forward and help those around the world, and I believe He will continue to do so as long as we use our blessings not just for our good but for the good of mankind.  I hope that in the weeks to come, as we debate the proper role of government and the proper way to fund it, we understand what a critical component foreign aid and the international affairs budget is to our national security, our economic interests, and our very identity as a people and as a nation.

579,topic-id,2344,"Mr.President, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or  Like many of President Trump's other nominees, my opposition to Congressman Mulvaney has less to do with his extreme rightwing economic views than it has to do with the hypocrisy and the dishonesty of President The simple truth is that Congressman Mulvaney's record, in many respects, is the exact opposite of the rhetoric that then-Candidate Trump used in order to get votes from senior citizens and working families. Now, if Candidate Trump had run his campaign by saying: I am going to cut your Social Security benefits if elected President, well, you know what, Congressman Mulvaney would have been the exact person that he should bring forth as OMB If President Trump had said: I am going to privatize your Medicare; vote for me because I am going to privatize your Medicare--if that is what he had campaigned on, then Congressman Mulvaney would have been exactly the right choice for OMB If Candidate Trump had said: I want to devastate Medicare, I want to make it harder for poor people to get the healthcare they need, and I want to threaten the nursing home care of millions of senior citizens--if that is what Candidate Trump had said, Mick Mulvaney would have been exactly the right and appropriate leader for the job.  But those are not the words, that is not the rhetoric, and those are not the ideas that Candidate Trump raised during his Presidential race. In fact, Candidate Trump said exactly the opposite on May 7, 2015. We are all familiar with Mr.Trump's tweets. Here is a tweet that he made on May 7, 2015:       I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state      there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare and      Huckabee copied me.  So you have Candidate Trump making it very clear that there would be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and  On August 10, 2015, Trump said:       [I will] save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security      without cuts. [We] have to do it. . . . People have been      paying in for years, and now many of these candidates want to      cut it.  On November 3, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       I will save Social I'll save medicare. . . .      People love . . . I'm not going to cut it.  On March 10, 2016, Mr.Trump said:       I will do everything within my power not to touch Social      Security, to leave it the way it is . . . it's my absolute      intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not      increase the age and to leave it as is.       It is my absolute intention to leave Social Security the      way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.  It can't be much clearer than that.  On May 21, 2015, Mr.Trump tweeted:       I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know      where to get the money from. Nobody else does.  On January 24, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       I'm not a cutter. I will probably be the only Republican      that doesn't want to cut Social  Those are pretty strong statements. What he just told you, in no uncertain terms, can't be clearer than that. He doesn't want to cut Social He doesn't want to cut Medicare and doesn't want to cut And you know what, millions of people actually believed what he said. They actually thought that Candidate Trump was telling the truth.  But now that the election is over, President Trump has nominated a budget director, Mr.Mulvaney, who would cut Social Security, would cut Medicare, would cut Medicaid, and would threaten the entire security of millions of  We just heard the exact quotes coming from candidate Donald Let's now hear the exact quotes coming from Congressman Mick Mulvaney about his views on these very same issues.  On May 15, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said on FOX Business News:       We have to end Medicare as we know it.  On April 28, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said:       Medicare as it exists today is finished.  On August 1, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said:       You have to raise the retirement age, lower a pay-out,      change the reimbursement system. You simply cannot leave      [Social Security] the way it is.  On May 17, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said: ``I honestly don't think we went far enough with the Ryan plan'' because it did not cut Social Security and Medicare ``rapidly enough.''  Just 2 years ago, Congressman Mulvaney voted against the budget proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price and House Speaker Paul Ryan, opting instead to vote in favor of an even more extreme budget by the Republican Study The budget that Congressman Mulvaney supported would have cut Medicare by $69 billion more than the Price-Ryan budget. It would have cut Social Security by $184 billion more, and it would have cut Medicaid by $255 billion more than the budget proposed by Chairman Price and House Speaker  In fact, Congressman Mulvaney made it clear during his confirmation hearing in the Budget Committee that he would advise President Trump to break his promises not to cut Social Security, Medicare, and During that hearing, Senator Corker called President Trump's campaign promises ``totally unrealistic'' and said that they ``make no sense whatsoever.''  When Senator Corker asked Congressman Mulvaney if he would advise the President not to follow through on the campaign promises he made to seniors, this is what Congressman Mulvaney said:       I have to imagine that the President knew what he was      getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to      think it is why he hired me.  Whoa, what we have been discussing is precisely why so many people have contempt for what goes on here in Congress and what goes on in Washington, in general. What is going on here is that a candidate for President of the United States says one thing in order to get votes, but the day after he is elected, his tune dramatically changes, and he nominates a number of people to his Cabinet and to high-level positions within his administration who intend to do exactly the opposite of what he campaigned on. Once again, Congressman Mulvaney--and I believe he is exactly right--said:       I have to imagine that the President knew what he was      getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to      think it is why he hired me.  So the President hires somebody who has been one of the most vigorous proponents of cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, and of cutting Medicaid after he ran his entire campaign telling the American people he would not cut Social Security, cut Medicare, and cut  Outside of Capitol Hill, where real people live, it turns out, not surprisingly, that the overwhelming majority of Americans--be they Democrats, Republicans, or Independents--are opposed to cutting Social In fact, according to an October 2016 survey by Public Policy Polling, 72 percent of the American people, including 51 percent of Republicans, ``support increasing, not cutting, Social Security benefits by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay more into the system.''[[Page S1207]]  As it happens, that is exactly the heart and soul of the legislation that I will soon be offering. Legislation that I will be offering will expand Social Security benefits, not cut them. It will do so by asking the top 2 percent to pay more in taxes, which, it turns out, is not only the right thing to do, but it is precisely what the American people want us to do. Various other polls have reached similar results. The people of our country--once you get outside the Congress and outside of the Republican caucus, in particular--the American people know that when millions of seniors, disabled veterans, and people with disabilities are trying to get by on $13, $14, $15,000 a year, you do not cut their benefits, while at the same time give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent. That is not what the American people want.  In my view, we don't need a budget director like Congressman Mulvaney, who believes that Social Security is a ``Ponzi scheme.'' We don't need a budget director who once voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.Department of Education unconstitutional. He was in, I believe, the South Carolina State Legislature, State He actually voted on a vote--which got very few votes--in the South Carolina State He voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.Department of Education unconstitutional. This is the person whom President Trump has nominated to become the head of  So if you believe Social Security is unconstitutional, if you believe it is a good idea to cut benefits for people who will be living on $13,000 or $14,000 a year, I guess Mr.Mulvaney is your choice. If that is whom my Republican colleagues want to vote for, that is their business, but my job and the job of everybody is to make it clear to the American people that the Republicans are far more interested in cutting Social Security and in giving huge tax breaks to billionaires than they are in taking care of the needs of the American people.  We need a budget director who understands that we have a retirement crisis in America today. Today, more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings. That is just an extraordinary reality. Over half of older workers in this country have zero in the bank. Think about what they are feeling when they hear people like Congressman Mulvaney saying: Hey, you got nothing now. You are going to try to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year in Social Security, and we are going to cut those benefits.  Today, more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings. More than one-third of senior citizens depend on Social Security for all of their income. One out of five senior citizens is trying to make ends meet on income of less than $13,000 a year. I will tell you, I hope people are able to sleep well, people who think it is appropriate to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut benefits for people who are trying to get by on Social Security checks of $13,000 a year.  In my view, we don't need a budget director who believes that ``we have to end Medicare as we know it,'' nor do we need a budget director who has said that ``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' Let's remember for a moment what things were like before Medicare was signed into law back in 1965. At that point, about half of all seniors were uninsured and millions more were underinsured. Today, thanks to Medicare, about 45 million seniors have health insurance, and the senior poverty rate has plummeted. Seniors are living healthier, longer lives. Thank you,  In my view, we do not need a budget director who supports cutting Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, threatening not only the healthcare of low-income people but also the nursing home care of millions of vulnerable senior citizens and persons with disabilities. There are millions of not just low-income families but middle-class families who today are getting help with the nursing home payments for their parents through If you make devastating cuts in Medicaid, you are not only going to take away health insurance from low-income Americans, you are going to put enormous economic stress on middle-class families who will now have to pay the full tab for the nursing home care of their parents.  Finally, there is another issue; that is, Mr.Mulvaney's taxes. After Congressman Mulvaney was nominated to become the next OMB Director, it was revealed that he failed to pay over $15,000 in taxes for a nanny he employed from the year 2000 through 2004. Here is what Congressman Mulvaney wrote in response to a question I asked him on January 11:       I have come to learn during the confirmation review process      that I failed to pay FICA and Federal and State unemployment      taxes on a household employee for the years 2000 through      2004. Upon discovery of that shortfall, I paid the Federal      taxes. The amount in question for Federal FICA and      unemployment was $15,583.60, exclusive of penalties and      interest which are not yet determined. The State amounts are      not yet determined.  This is a very serious issue. As you will recall, 8 years ago Senator Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination as Secretary of Health and Human Services after it was discovered that he failed to pay taxes for one of his domestic workers.  On this issue, I agree wholeheartedly with Minority Leader Schumer, who said:       When other previous Cabinet nominees failed to pay their      fair share in taxes, Senate Republicans forced those nominees      to withdraw from consideration. If failure to pay taxes was      disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same should      be true for Republican nominees.  Mr.President, here is the irony: Over and over again, Congressman Mulvaney has sponsored and cosponsored legislation designed to prohibit people from serving in the government if they fail to pay their taxes. In 2015, Congressman Mulvaney voted for a bill in the House that stated: ``Any individual who has a seriously delinquent tax debt should be ineligible to be appointed or to continue serving as an employee'' of the Federal Congressman Mulvaney cosponsored three bills when he was in the South Carolina State Senate that would have prohibited tax cheats from serving in the South Carolina State government. In other words, it looks like there is one set of rules for Congressman Mulvaney and another set of rules for everyone else.  In light of this information and in light of Congressman Mulvaney's extreme rightwing record of attacking the needs of the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor, I would urge all of my colleagues to vote no on this nomination.  With that, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,1010,WELCOMING BRUCE BAILLIE TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS,2017.0,15.0,February

1507,topic-id,2304,"Mr.President, I had very serious concerns about the nomination of Attorney General Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and opposed his nomination. His record on the environment is abysmal. My office received a great number of comments from people in the State of Vermont, which takes environmental protection very seriously, as well as from all over the country. They fear that Mr.Pruitt is bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry and the protection of our environment is in serious jeopardy. Make no mistake, the nomination of Scott Pruitt was a nomination designed to protect the fossil fuel industry and not the environment.  In many ways, Scott Pruitt is the worst of the worst of all of Trump's nominees. Donald Trump was going to drain the swamp. He promised to ``break the cycle of corruption'' and ``give new voices a chance to go into government service.'' Well, guess who is running the swamp now: the same corporate cronies Trump promised to drain out of  Scott Pruitt wants to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, but he is no friend of the environment. He boasts on his website that he is a ``leading advocate'' against the He said, ``The agency's actions are at best incompetent, and at worst reprehensible.'' He testified to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in May 2016 that ``the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''  What is particularly troubling is his record as Oklahoma's attorney general--as Oklahoma's chief enforcer of clean air and water protections for his constituents--he sued the EPA 14 times and still has 8 active cases against the In all but one of these 14 cases Pruitt brought against the EPA, he was on the side of corporate interests. And in 13 of the 14, these companies or trade associations were also financial contributors to Mr.Pruitt's political causes.  Shockingly, Scott Pruitt disbanded the Environmental Protection Unit of the Oklahoma Attorney General's He claims that he continued environmental protection, but the State budget shows that funding for ``environmental law'' in the attorney general's office fell from $486,000 in 2011 to 0 in 2014. In the State's 2016 budget, there was a line item for ``environmental law''--with $0. In fact, of the more than 700 press releases he issued as Oklahoma's top law enforcement official, not one touts an environmental enforcement case in It seems clear that he abandoned all meaningful environmental protection. This is concerning because reports show that the Trump administration is considering eliminating the EPA's Office of Enforcement, which would mean that the Agency would no longer be able to independently enforce our Nation's antipollution laws.  At a time when we have to strengthen environmental protection, Mr.Pruitt will be working overtime to carry out President Trump's goal to destroy the Does this sound like someone who should be running the EPA? Not to me. More than 230 different environmental, health, and public interest groups agree that Pruitt is unqualified--so do former EPA employees. More than 770 of them from across the country all signed on to a letter that asked us to reject Pruitt as the next EPA When hundreds of environmental groups and former EPA employees tell us that this guy is not qualified, maybe we should listen.  The scariest thing about Scott Pruitt being the Administrator of the EPA is that our EPA should be working nonstop to address the most pressing environmental issue of our time--the global crisis of climate change. In 2009, the EPA Administrator found that the carbon pollution causing climate change threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations; yet President Trump has called climate change a ``hoax.'' In November 2012, he tweeted: ``The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.manufacturing non-competitive.''  Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Mr.Pruitt takes the same page from President Pruitt said in March 2016, ``Reasonable minds can disagree about the science behind global warming, and disagree they do.'' He also said ``The debate about climate change is just that, a debate. There are scientists that agree, there are scientists that don't agree, to the extent of man's contribution and whether it is even harmful at this point,'' he added ``We've had ebb and flow, we've had obviously climate conditions change throughout our history and that is scientific fact. It gets cooler. It gets hotter. And we do not know the trajectory is on an unsustainable course. Nor do we know, the extent by which the burning of fossil fuels, and man's contribution to that, is making it far worse than it is.''  When I questioned Mr.Pruitt in his confirmation hearing on January 18, he said: ``I believe . . . the degree of human activity's impact on the climate is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or whether human activity contributes to it.'' He even told me that he thinks that his opinion on climate change is[[Page S1443]]immaterial to his role as EPA This is ludicrous. It is not immaterial--it is in fact essential--that we have an EPA Administrator who agrees with the scientific data and is willing to lead the fight against climate change. Yet, in his answers, he stated, ``there is a diverse range of views regarding the key drivers of our changing climate among scientists. I believe that these differences should be the subject of robust and open debate free from intimidation. If confirmed, I will continue to encourage an honest debate on our changing climate, the role of human activity, our ability to measure the degree and extent of human activity, and what to do about it.''  Almost all--97 percent--of scientists have concluded that climate change is real. It is caused by human activity. And it is already causing devastating problems in our country and around the world. If we do not move aggressively to transition our energy system away from fossil fuels toward sustainable energy like solar, wind, and geothermal, the problem will become much worse.  Just this month, a report in the peer-reviewed journal The Anthropocene Review, researchers found that humans are causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces. This is just another reason why it is unacceptable for Mr.Pruitt to say that he ``believe[s] the ability to measure with precision, the degree of human activity's impact on the climate is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or whether human activity contributes to it.''  For 200 years, we have been burning increasing amounts of fossil fuels to heat our buildings, generate electricity, and power our vehicles. When we burn fossil fuels, we release significant amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere. In fact, today, humans release more than 35 billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere every year. According to NASA, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has never exceeded 300 parts per million in the past 650,000 years. In 2013, CO2 levels reached 400 parts per million for the first time.  So it should not come as a surprise to hear that the planet is warming at an alarming rate: 2016 was the hottest year on record, and 16 of the 17 hottest years have occurred since 2000. Nor should it come as a surprise that we are already seeing devastating effects of climate change all across the United States and around the globe: more intense wildfires, heatwaves, drought, extreme storms, flooding, rising sea levels, and more. Americans are worried. A study released last month shows that more than 6 in 10 Americans say that they worried about global warming.  But climate change is not the only area that makes Americans worried about Pruitt being the EPA They are worried about Pruitt's inaction in the face of a growing number of earthquakes in In the past few years, Oklahoma has been plagued by thousands of earthquakes, which the U.Geological Survey said are tied to fracking wastewater injection. Oklahoma's current earthquake rate is now 600 times higher than its prefracking rate. Oklahoma now has more earthquakes on a regular basis than  In 2011 in Prague, OK, The Oklahoman newspaper reported a 5.6 earthquake, stating that scientists ``believe the earthquake was caused by injection wells in the area.'' To put that in perspective, an earthquake in the magnitude 5 range, like the one reported, releases as much energy as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. But, before 2009, there were, on average, two earthquakes a year in Oklahoma that were magnitude 3 or greater. By 2013, there were 109 magnitude 3 or greater earthquakes; by 2014, that had grown to 585 magnitude 3 or greater earthquakes; and by 2015, there were 907 magnitude 3 or greater earthquakes.  The damage was extensive; 40 to 50 buildings in Cushing, OK, were substantially damaged in a November 2016 earthquake. In reaction to the then-largest earthquake in September 2015, the Pawnee Nation passed a resolution against fracking activities after suffering damage to seven historic tribal buildings. The Ponca Nation also passed has a moratorium on fracking because the earthquakes have caused damage to their crumbling water infrastructure and buildings. Scientists say that Oklahoma is ``almost certain'' to have more earthquakes, with heightened risks of a large quake probable to endure for a decade.  The Attorneys General in my State of Vermont, California, and New York have all frequently acted quickly to address environmental problems; yet, during Mr.Pruitt's hearing, he told me he did nothing to help folks in Oklahoma who had been hurt by earthquakes caused by fracking in Pruitt's sole response to my questions during his hearing about what he had done to address the earthquake problem in his State was to say he has ``acknowledged that he is concerned.'' That is it. ``He's concerned.'' He did not stand up and say he will do everything he can to stop future earthquakes as a result of fracking. He did not sue the corporations who were causing the earthquakes on behalf of the people of He did not hold a press conference. He did nothing.  These earthquakes are so concerning because the EPA ``regulates the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells used to place fluids underground for storage or disposal'' as part of its role in preventing contamination of drinking water. So, if we let Pruitt will nor lead the EPA, there is nothing to say he will not abandon efforts to regulate waste fracking water injection to protect the American people from earthquakes. If his past record is any indication, it is very questionable that he will take action to protect communities from harmful effects like these.  Maybe the reason so many are concerned he will abandon efforts to enforce environmental laws and why he was willing to abandon Oklahomans when they needed him is because he is in the pocket of corporate industry. Pruitt received more than $350,000 in contributions from the fossil fuel industry. Pruitt raised huge amounts for his two Federal PAC--known as Liberty 2.0 and Oklahoma According to Politico, Liberty 2.0 has raised more than $168,000 from energy interests, and Oklahoma Strong leadership has raised $72,000.  In 2014, in a Pulitzer Prize winning investigation, the New York Times exposed that Pruitt and numerous other Republican attorneys general had formed secret alliances with energy corporations. The New York Times also exposed the Defense Fund, which is a dark money offshoot of the Republican Attorneys General The Defense Fund received $175,000 in 2014 from Freedom Partners, which coordinates the Koch brothers' political activities. The New York Times also detailed how, in 2011, Pruitt wrote a letter to the EPA Administrator claiming that Federal regulators were grossly overestimating the amount of air pollution caused by energy companies drilling new natural gas wells in his Pruitt did not write the letter on behalf of Oklahoma residents; he did it on behalf of one of Oklahoma's biggest oil and gas companies, Devon As he fought for corporate donors, the American Lung Association named three urban regions in Oklahoma as having the 25 most heavily polluted air regions in the United  These examples of Pruitt's corrupt relationship with corporate polluters are so shocking and dangerous because he wants to lead the EPA, an Agency which is most responsible for protecting our kids and grandkids from the very polluters he has protected for so long. For the sake of our children and grandchildren and the future of this planet, were there none of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who would speak out to say that Mr.Pruitt should not be confirmed as head of the EPA?  The last time I checked, no one voted to pollute the environment in the last election. The majority of Americans do not agree that we should be dismantling protections that ensure clean air and clean water. In fact, according to Gallup, more than 7 in 10 Americans worry about drinking water pollution and air pollution. That is why we cannot allow Scott Pruitt to drive the EPA into the ground. He has shown that he wants to dismantle basic air, water, and climate protections.  We cannot rollback decades of progress. In fact, we are in desperate need of strong laws and regulations to[[Page S1444]]protect the environment and fight climate change. Do not be fooled. Scott Pruitt is not for protecting American citizens and the environment, but for protecting giant polluting corporations. With a record like his, we cannot expect Pruitt to safeguard our drinking water and air from pollution. With Pruitt, the environment will be auctioned off to the highest corporate bidder no matter the cost to the American public. It was for all these reasons that I strongly opposed Mr.Pruitt's nomination, and I urged my colleagues to join me in voting no.

390,topic-id,303,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to yet another reckless attack by the majority on the retirement security of millions of I don't get why the majority is so determined to go after the retirement security of so many millions of Americans across this country, but that is what H.66 would do.  It may get harder for everyday Americans to prepare for their retirement. The resolution we are considering today would prevent State governments--it doesn't make any sense to do this--from providing retirement savings opportunities for their citizens.  The fact of the matter is, as was just alluded to, this resolution was designed at the behest of Wall Street and well-connected lobbyists to sideline competition and transparent financial products in the retirement savings market. But this isn't the first time.  They put all their energy behind blocking the automatic IRA when it was a proposal that came forward a few years back, even though it was a Heritage Foundation proposal. Then they went after the fiduciary rule that President Obama and the Department of Labor sought to put in place that would protect our retirees from unscrupulous investment advisers.  Then President Trump comes in with an executive order to undo what the Department of Labor was trying to do. So we shouldn't be surprised by this action, but we ought to be furious about it.  My State, Maryland, was one of the States that tried to figure out how to protect retirees because we couldn't get it done up here. Now, what are we doing? The party of states' rights is advancing a Congressional Review Act resolution designed to hinder State legislatures that are working to provide access to safe and affordable retirement savings options for their citizens. We shouldn't allow this to happen.  I encourage my colleagues to reject this senseless resolution.

Median retirement savings in the United States of America is only $2,500. We have a retirement crisis. Only my Republican colleagues haven't gotten the message.  The New York Times asked: ``Who'd Want to Limit Retirement Plans?'' and answered with two words: ``House Republicans.''  It isn't just that Republicans haven't made retirement security a priority; they are actually working against it. They oppose the rule that saves retirees up to $17 billion a year, lost to bad investment advice, a rule that simply requires financial advisers to give advice that is in the client's best interest, not their own.  Today Republicans are trying to prevent States and cities from expanding private retirement savings. Nearly 1.3 million workers in my State, Illinois, lack job-based retirement savings options. State Senator Daniel Biss won passage of the Illinois Secure Choice Savings Program that creates a retirement plan with automatic deductions that has proven successful in increasing individual retirement savings.

743,topic-id,260,"Madam Speaker, well, here we are again, considering legislation that would harm women and families.  Let's be clear: House Republicans do not support family planning title For years, Republicans have tried to completely eliminate funding for title X through the appropriations process. So think about that. We are debating contraception in 2017--astonishing.  Title X provides millions of low- and middle-income men and women with access to reproductive healthcare services. The joint resolution we are voting on today would allow States to discriminate against title X providers who perform abortion with non-Federal funds by removing them from the program, leaving patients with few options for the care they need.  Again, let's be clear. If you want to reduce the number of abortions, you need to ensure everyone has access to family planning. Teen pregnancy and the rate of abortion are at historic lows because we have worked to make contraception more affordable and accessible.  For over 60 percent of title X patients, the clinics they visit for family planning services are their only regular source of care, and yet we are considering legislation that would result in clinic closures and would prevent men and women from seeing trusted providers in their own communities.  Do Republicans oppose cancer screening for cervical breast cancer? Do they oppose STI testing? Do they oppose contraception? The answer seems to be yes because Republicans continue to[[Page H1277]]ignore these facts in their effort to harm women's health.

792,topic-id,827,"Mr.Speaker, I really appreciate participating in this Special Order hour about things that, I think, the American people really ought to be caring about.  The minute that Donald Trump took the oath of office and put his hand in the air, he was in violation of the law. It is just a fact that the Trump Hotel, which is in the old post office building--there is a very explicit contract that says no elected official may enter into a contract for that hotel and profit from the business in that hotel. There was a lawsuit that was filed. It is still pending.  You may not think that is a really big deal, but how about this: What if there were delegations from somewhere else in the world, some country that really wanted to curry favor with the United States of America, and decided a really good way to do it would be to move our delegation to stay at the Trump Hotel?                              {time}  1715  Maybe we could have a big gala, we could have a party, and we could make a lot of money from that. And guess what. Maybe the President of the United States would notice that we are spending money in a hotel from which he gains a profit, and that would be a really swell idea.  Well, actually, the Framers of the Constitution thought that was not such a grand idea and very explicitly put into the Constitution something that would prohibit any foreign government from influencing U.policy. They were worried about the King of They were worried about They were worried about other countries having too much influence on the United States by currying favor with the President and the decisionmakers, and so they introduced and put into the Constitution very explicitly what they called the Emoluments Clause in Article I, section 9 of the  While ``emoluments'' is certainly not a word we use in regular conversations--emoluments, I never used it before this and never heard of it before this, actually--it is a concept that is part of our Constitution, and it is very simple: that no government official should receive benefits of any kind--of any kind--from a foreign government. President Trump is clearly violating that constitutional principle.  So, unlike any Presidents before him, President Trump has actually refused to fully separate himself and his family from his business dealings. It is also very unusual, of course, that we haven't seen his tax returns, which has been pretty standard for any President to release his tax returns, and it has been a requirement for the Cabinet that Mr.Trump has exacted from those nominees.  Because of his business holdings, Trump and his family are constantly--constantly--receiving benefits from other countries, whether it is foreign governments renting that space at the Trump Hotel in D.or the loans and business agreements that the Trump organization has with China, Russia, and many other countries. We don't know them all. We haven't seen them all. That would be in his tax returns and all the different sections of the tax return, his holdings in Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, which he has refused to put into a blind trust.  So it is troubling enough that President Trump and his family are profiting off the Presidency, but now it is becoming clearer that this lack of ethics could threaten our national security and national interests. So if you haven't cared until now, you ought to start caring.  Look at Trump has done business in Russia and has remained uncomfortably close to Vladimir He refuses to release his tax returns, which could clarify the specific financial interests that he has in  President Trump knew his National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, was compromised by Russian intelligence and had misled Vice President Pence; yet Flynn was allowed to remain in one of our most sensitive national security positions until criticism from Congress, the media, and the public became too much to ignore.  President Trump continues to gloss over the serious problems that led to Flynn's resignation. Instead, he attacks the messenger and the leaks that brought Flynn's conduct to light. These are bright red flags. These are signs that the President has something to hide.  Americans deserve a President who they can trust is putting the country's interests ahead of his own, that he is putting the country's interests instead of another country's interests because that deal might be in his interest.  There should be no question over the purity of the President's motives, especially when he is making critical security decisions on behalf of the If President Trump wants to assure the American people that he deserves our[[Page H1292]]trust, he must be transparent. We need a bipartisan, independent investigation of his conflicts of interest, particularly with Russia, but not exclusively.

586,topic-id,4771,"Mr.President, the Senate is preparing to vote on Congressman Mick Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and This nomination may seem like it doesn't deserve a lot of attention because we don't hear much outside of Washington about the OMB, the Office of Management and It is kind of a wonky, obscure office, with fewer than 500 staff members.  At a time when there are so many looming questions about this Republic, about this administration, it is easy to overlook the Congressman's nomination, but it actually matters very much, particularly at this moment, and that is because the person who controls the budget, the person who has the final say on fiscal and financial priorities for the administration has immense power. This position controls the President's budget, and that means that this person can give the green light to programs and policies across the Federal Government or stop them in their tracks. And because he has a long track record as a legislator, Congressman Mulvaney has already shown what kind of decisionmaker he will be if he is in charge of the Office of Management and Budget,  I will be blunt. His record and his ideas are worrisome. It should concern every Senator who is worried about some of the biggest issues facing Americans, from Social Security, to public health, to the basic, uninterrupted operations of the government itself. So this vote is a moment of truth. It will determine where we really stand on the issues that shape both individual lives and our country's future.  Let me highlight just four issues to show why this person is the wrong person to run  The first is Social More than 80 years ago, President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law. In doing so, he created a national plan to provide economic security for American workers. Since then, Social Security has proven to be the most successful anti-poverty program in our history. Each year, it lifts more than 20 million Americans, including 1 million children, out of poverty.  It is hard to imagine a world without Social Security, but I want everybody to understand that pre-Social Security, we had tens of millions of Americans--more than we do now--who would be in poverty upon retirement. So this program has actually reduced poverty among the elderly more than any other program could possibly have accomplished.  Nowhere is Social Security more important than in More than 200,000 people receive Social Security benefits. For more than one in four Hawaii seniors, Social Security is their only source of income. And the money just isn't enough; it is about $14,000 a year. Just to give folks an understanding of Hawaii, we are considered the second or third most expensive housing market in the United We are after New York and sometimes in second place or third place, depending on where San Francisco is, but we are one of the most expensive places to live in the United For one in four Social Security recipients, that is all they get--$1,200 a month. Usually that will cover your apartment. That will not cover your electricity, it won't cover your utilities, it won't cover your food or clothing, and it won't cover your healthcare.  Today, most working households have little or no retirement assets at all, and many rely entirely on Social This is partly because employer-provided pensions are becoming a thing of the past. So Social Security is more important than ever. It has become a pillar of our retirement system[[Page S1211]]that continues to work well. It is a universal guaranteed source of income that workers earn and depend on when they retire, but it is just not enough.  I will just add that it is only in Washington, DC, where entertaining the idea of cutting Social Security is considered moderate or mainstream or conservative, even, or adult. I mean, there is this sense that the way we ought to fix the challenges we have fiscally as a country is to take it out of the hides of people who get $1,200 a month to live.  Instead of strengthening the program, Mr.Mulvaney's ideas are very radical. He has said he wants to systematically alter Social Security by raising the retirement age to 70 years old. He wants to raise the retirement age to 70 years old. This is not an obscure person being appointed to an obscure post; this is a Member of Congress being appointed to be the head of the Office of Management and We are going to vote on him tomorrow, and everybody who says they are for Social Security is about to vote for a person who wants to raise the Social Security retirement age to 70 years old.  He has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. When he worked in the South Carolina State Senate, he voted to declare Social Security unconstitutional. Again, he voted to declare Social Security unconstitutional, and I predict he will get all of the Republican votes. And all of these folks who say they wanted to protect your Social Security, after they put Tom Price at the head of HHS, they are about to put someone who is dedicated to undermining the most successful anti-poverty program in American history.  When asked in his confirmation hearing--because, look, you are a Member of Congress; you represent a certain constituency; you have certain views. Some people are able to sort of pivot from their role as a legislator, as a politician, and into a role as an appointee, a Secretary, a nominee. So when he was asked in this confirmation hearing if he would recommend that the President break a campaign promise to leave Social Security alone, the Congressman said that he would recommend that the President make cuts to the program. So this isn't something he has recanted; this is something he stands by--up until and including through his confirmation and his service at  But why make cuts to the most successful anti-poverty program in American history? Why would we make cuts to a program that is financed by its own revenue stream and by law does not add $1 to the deficit? Why would we cut benefits now just because we may have to cut them in 20 years? If we are going to change Social Security, let's do it in a way that expands benefits for generations to come. Let's lift the cap on taxable earnings. Let's remove the wage cap that unfairly shelters the highest earning Americans from paying into the Social Security trust fund that the majority of hard-working Americans do.  Here is how it works. The cap is roughly $120,000. So you pay Social Security--almost everybody pays Social Security tax, up to $120,000 in income. That is mostly everybody, right. But if you make $120,000, all of that is taxed up to $120,000. If you make $70,000, it is taxed up to $70,000. If you make $120 million in income, your first $120,000 is taxed for Social Security purposes; everything else is taxed at zero for Social Security purposes.  My view is that every dollar of income should be taxed for Social Security purposes, and that does two things: First, we are going to be in a position to increase benefits--not massively, but every little bit counts. Second, we will be able to increase the solvency of the Social Security trust fund to the year 2049.  Most every family has a Social Security story, whether it is a grandmother who relies on the program's benefits to pay for groceries, a father who suffered a debilitating injury after decades of hard work and receives much needed Social Security disability benefits, or a widowed mother who relies on Social Security survivors benefits to bring up her children.  In my own home, we have three generations living together--my wife Linda and me; our kids, Tyler and Mia; and Linda's parents, George and Ping George Kwok lived the American dream. He ran a chop suey house, a Chinese restaurant in Honolulu, Kwok's Chop Suey, and worked hard all his life to give opportunities to his kids, until his eyes gave out. Like 200,000 seniors across Hawaii, he now relies on Social Security--SSDI--Social Security disability.  I tell you about my family not because we are unique but because we are not, because we are like so many families in Hawaii and across the country. And with the number of retirees growing, we need to do everything we can to strengthen this program, not to weaken it.  After a lifetime of hard work, seniors deserve to retire with the dignity and the benefits they have earned. This is a promise from the Federal The current generation of Americans must keep our promises to seniors, but given his record, I am convinced that Congressman Mulvaney will try to do the opposite.  The second issue I am concerned about is the basic operations of government. Whether you are a member of the military, a visitor to a national park, or a worker looking to retire in the near future, we all need for the government to fulfill its basic obligations. But Congressman Mulvaney voted to default on the U.debt several times, and he did it in the face of warnings from the U.Treasury that this would be unprecedented and catastrophic for our economy and that it could drive the world deep into another recession just as we were finally recovering from the last one.  Think about how markets would react if the U.Government declared that it would not make good on its financial obligations. The stock markets would go crazy, and not in a good way. That would be terrible for the millions of people who invest their savings in the market for their retirement.  The Congressman has also voted several times to shut down the Federal Government, all in the name of getting his way. I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous his approach to government is. It is one thing as a Member of the House Freedom Caucus, as a Member of the U.House of Representatives--there are 435; you can take positions--but it doesn't have quite the direct impact that the Office of Management and Budget does. He has put party and partisan views over some of the most fundamental and basic principles of our government. To close the government, to stop paying our bills, to make people across the planet question the full faith and credit of the United States is beyond comprehension.  It should take a real crisis to pull Congress away from the negotiating table and all the challenges in front of us. But it actually wasn't a crisis that led the Congressman to vote to close our government; it was Planned Parenthood and the While we may disagree about the best approach on healthcare and even on reproductive choice and women's health, those disagreements should never get in the way of the U.Government going about its business. Yet Congressman Mulvaney's actions went against that basic principle.  With respect to our Democratic institutions, the procedural violence that was done to the U.Congress is hard to overstate in this case. The idea that a faction of a party would demand concessions--and I think we remember this--would demand concessions in exchange for satisfying their infliction of pain on the United States is unbelievable. And why? Because we are all Americans here. We all want to do right by our country. So the idea that one party would be willing to inflict terrible pain on the country, or else, was so beyond the pale that there is no rule against it, there is no law against it. And do you know why there is no rule and no law against it? It is because nobody contemplated that a major political party would behave in such a way. The assumption has always been that elected leaders would find a better way to stand up for their strongly held beliefs than by threatening to bring the American economy to its knees. Up until the shutdown led by the Congressman, that had been a safe assumption.  In 2011, Congress's delay in raising the debt limit forced the Department of Treasury to take what they call extraordinary measures to ensure that our government could pay its bills.[[Page S1212]]GAO estimates that this raised Treasury's borrowing costs by about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011. That is $1.3 billion in added government costs just for coming close to defaulting. The Bipartisan Policy Center projects that the full cost of that crisis to the Federal Government alone--not to the private sector economy, just the Federal Government--was around $20 billion over the maturity of that debt.  There is nothing conservative about defaulting on what we owe. It cripples free markets. It is Russian roulette playing, with a bullet in every chamber. There is nothing conservative about that.  When the government closed in 2013, we paid Federal workers to stay home. I want everybody to understand what we ended up doing. Listen, it wasn't their fault. These government employees are not the ones who screwed up; it was the Congress that screwed up. We paid dedicated Federal workers who want to do their jobs, not to do their jobs. We forced them to stay home and paid them anyway. I defy you to find a conservative outside of the Halls of Congress who finds that to be a conservative proposition. It is one thing to shut down the government for a couple of weeks and accrue the savings. I think that is inhumane, I think that is bananas, but at least you would save the money. These folks ended up paying all the money out and just forcing government workers to not do their jobs. This is not the left or right; this is upside down. We prevented Federal workers from doing their important work, like assisting small businesses and combating terrorism.  Ultimately, the 2013 shutdown was a bad move for our economy and for our budget. It cost us money instead of saving us money. In just the first week, it cost the economy $1.6 billion in lost economic output, and it cost about $160 million a day on the private sector side.  Worst of all, the Congressman has not seen the error of this. There were a lot of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who--in the heat of the battle, you sort of think the other side is going to back off and listen. We all learn lessons. We all make mistakes. There are a lot of Republicans who went through that shutdown and said: We never want to do that to the country again. But Congressman Mulvaney has not seen the error of his ways. He still believes the government shutdown was a good idea, and he said so at the confirmation hearing.  Senator McCaskill asked if he still thought the shutdown was the right way to go about things, and he answered yes. He answered yes. This kind of budget brinkmanship is not good for our government, to say the least, but it is certainly a bad fit for the person running the  The third issue I want to talk about is the Congressman's rejection of the role of public health and science. If we look at some of the biggest issues our country faces, it is clear that we need an OMB Director who understands the value of science, research, and public health. But the Congressman has said that climate change is based on ``questionable science'' and ``baseless claims.'' He has asked if we need government-funded research at all. These are not the views we should see from the person who directs the budget of the executive branch.  In September of last year, Congressman Mulvaney posted a statement about Zika on He said:       I have received all sorts of email and Facebook comments      this week on Some people want me to pass a ``clean''      bill (which I suppose means not paying for it with spending      reductions elsewhere.) Other folks want us to fund more      research if we can find a way to pay for it.       No one has written me yet, though, to ask what might be the      best question: Do we really need government research at all?      Do we really need government funded research at all?  In his statement, he goes on to ask questions that many have asked about what we are seeing in Brazil, as opposed to other countries affected by But that is exactly why you do the research. It is not for a Member of Congress to referee how much money should go to CDC and play amateur scientist. We have expert agencies. The CDC did an extraordinary job, not just on Zika but on They have done extraordinary work over the decades in keeping people safe. If he is saying there are some scientific mysteries remaining around Zika, that is absolutely true. That is why we need to give the CDC and the National Institutes of Health money to try to figure this out. Those questions are the very reasons we need government-funded research, not an excuse to get rid of it.  I want to be clear as to why this matters so much. I am not trying to catch him saying something that is a little off. There is a foundational, bipartisan consensus around public health research, and the person who has been nominated to run the Federal budget doesn't appear to believe in that research. This isn't just out of the political mainstream. People will die if he implements his point of view.  Look at some of the diseases where government-funded research has had a significant impact on saving lives: Ebola, HIV/AIDS, malaria, polio, to name a few. We have made the advances we see today because the government stepped in and invested in the research, and that has to continue.  Right around the time we debated funding for Zika, I visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in Atlanta to learn more about their efforts to combat Zika, dengue, and other diseases. I left Atlanta feeling totally confident that the CDC will help our country with challenges like Millions of Americans are counting on the government to maintain that confidence. But that can happen only if CDC has the strongest funding possible so they can continue to do their good work.  Taking money away from the Prevention and Public Health Fund would strip the CDC and other important agencies of the funds they need to protect our country from within and from without. That is what happened in The legislative branch did not fully step up to the plate and do its job in addressing Because of that, we forced the Obama administration to pull money from the CDC to address Ebola or from States to address other public health risks. Doing so disrupted public health infrastructure planning across the world that we still need to make sure that Ebola never ravages communities again.  Regardless of your side of the aisle, we can all agree this is the one thing that government has to do; that is, to keep us physically safe. Investing in CDC and other agencies that protect our citizens from diseases shouldn't depend on your philosophy of government. Unless you believe in, literally, no government, this is money well spent. This is the kind of thing the government does. We cannot walk away from our country's legacy of funding good research that saves lives, but that is exactly what Congressman Mulvaney suggests we do.  He has also made deeply disturbing comments about the science behind climate change. There can be no doubt that climate change is real, that it is caused by humans, and that we have a responsibility to take action. We ignore the science that shows us this at our own risk, and it is a risk our country cannot take.  The fourth and final issue I want to touch upon is healthcare--specifically, Medicare and I am a little worried that people feel reassured because of the rhetoric they heard last year from the He did reassure his voters that he was going to save Medicare and Medicaid and protect it from cuts. He promised several times that he wouldn't make any cuts whatsoever to Medicare and But when a Senator reminded Congressman Mulvaney about this during his confirmation hearing, he did not say he would support the administration's promises to the American people. He said that he would advise the President to break that promise. He said that he would advise President Trump to break his campaign promise and change Medicare and Why are we voting for this person? He said that he would advise the President to break the promise and change Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  He wants to cut Medicaid--a program that millions of people rely upon. More than 50 years ago, when Medicaid was created, Congress made a really smart decision and designed the program so that if and when healthcare costs rise or the economy starts to struggle, Medicaid would be there for the American people, no matter what. Now the counselor to the President says that as part of the ACA replacement plan, Medicaid will be converted to block grants.[[Page S1213]]  I worry a little bit about the phrasing ``block grants'' because that doesn't sound that bad. I used to work in the not-for-profit sector. I like grants, and I used to pursue Community Development Block Grants, Community Services Block I like grants; I like I am not sure whether ``block'' means anything positively or negatively, but I want everybody to understand what block-granting Medicaid means: It means cutting That is exactly what it means. It is a euphemism. People in this administration and people nominated to be part of this administration share that view, and they have a long history to back it up.  The term ``block grants'' is a euphemism. It is not quite a lie, but it is a way to describe something so that you don't know what it is. They are calling it a block grant because they don't want to say they are cutting That is what they are doing; they are going to cut Medicaid, and these cuts will hurt millions of people. They will hurt working families.  Everybody understands Medicaid is there for the economically indigent, in the case of an emergency. But the thing that people also don't realize--and that is a really important aspect of that program--but it is also really important for nursing home care. That is not just an issue for people who are down on their luck financially or while they are young or while they are parents. When people get older, it is really difficult to afford nursing home care. For most people who are not extraordinarily wealthy, Medicaid is the way to handle nursing home care. It is reimbursable.  I know that nursing home care in Hawaii costs $8,000, $9,000 a month. I don't know anybody who can run through $8,000, $9,000 a month for very long. I know a couple of people, but most people I know can't do that without Certainly, Medicaid is an issue that affects the very poor, but it also affects the rest of us. It affects people who aren't just lying on a pile of cash to take care of their grandmother or their mother or their father or their spouse when they are in their golden years.  These cuts will hurt women who need Medicaid for maternal health services, as well as seniors and people with disabilities. These people have nowhere else to turn. Medicaid is their only option.  Some people point to expanded local control as a reason to move forward with block grants. That is just nonsense. They are basically going to flatten out or cut the amount a State gets, and then they can sit there and divide up an increasingly smaller pie. I am not sure if that is even a euphemism. That is just nonsense. That will not help any State to meet their needs. That is why Republican Governors--anybody with responsibility for actually governing, delivering services to their constituents--don't want to cut They don't want to reduce Medicaid expansion under ACA, and they certainly don't want a block grant because they know what that will mean. Even if you are a fiscal conservative, if you are in charge of a State, you understand exactly what is going to happen to your constituents if Medicaid is cut.  This is another instance of a party that promised not to touch But here we are, debating a nominee to lead the OMB who wants to make cuts to this program. This is a deal breaker for me and for many others, and it will be a disaster for millions of That is why today we have to stand up for seniors, for women, for children and fight any cuts to That starts with voting no on this nomination.  I have heard about Congressman Mulvaney from hundreds of people from the State of I want to share a few of the messages that I have received from people in  Here is what one man from Oahu wrote:       As a researching scientist, I recognize the very      significant damage these appointees will have on US health      and competitiveness in the world.       A break in research funding, or politically-directed and      censored research, impacts long term research. A brief hiatus      can result in many years set-back of programs and resulting      societal benefits.  A woman from Volcano Village on the Big Island sent me this message:       [This administration's] agenda lies in [the] nominees for      the department of Health and Human Services and the Office of      Management and Budget who have spent their congressional      careers trying to destroy [Social Security, Medicare, and      Medicaid].  Another woman wrote me with this:       [The] nominees for HHS and OMB are walking disasters for      the department they'd lead.       Both have spent their congressional careers trying to      destroy [Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid]. Oh, yes,      and the ACA/Obamacare, which has proven to be resoundingly      popular.  We are hearing from so many people on these issues because they understand how this works. They understand that personnel is policy. You don't get to say you are for protecting Social Security, and then vote for someone who wants to eliminate Social Security as we know it. You don't get to say you are for protecting Medicare and Medicaid, and then vote for someone who has dedicated their career to eliminating or at least seriously undermining this program.  If you want to increase the Social Security retirement age, then this is your nominee. If you aren't opposed to seeing our country go through a series of precipices with the shutdown of the Federal Government--from the huge drops in the market to the closing of our National Parks--then this is your nominee. If you think Federal investments in public health, disease control, and prevention should be eliminated, then this is your nominee. If you want to see cuts to Medicare and Medicaid by 25 percent or more, then vote yes.  But if, like me, you know that this is not the right approach to governing, that this is not how we should go about caring for our people and preparing for the future, then you need to vote no.  At the end of the day, the leader of the Office of Management and Budget will need to understand how to build a budget for our country and make sure U.Government agencies have the resources they need to pursue the mission. This person will need to understand why diplomacy matters, why Medicare and Medicaid matter, why job training and education programs matter, and why financial and fiscal stability matters. Ultimately, he needs to know that government matters and that it can make a difference in people's lives. It determines how bright tomorrow can be for our kids and grandkids and how safe of a world we can create for them.  Congressman Mulvaney does not have that record or a confirmation hearing record that can convince any of us that he understands the potential we all have--the obligation we have--to make the right investments that reflect who we are and the future that we want as a country. That is why I will be voting no on this confirmation, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

999,topic-id,1665,"Mr.President, I think it is important to understand what just happened today that makes this debate on Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA so critically important. We call ourselves the world's greatest deliberative body, and that is actually a well-earned reputation. Sometimes we move slowly. Sometimes we move so slowly that it is maddening for both parties and for the American public. There is a reason that the Senate moves slowly. It is because in a lot of instances it has the weightiest decisions that any public official could ever make. In this instance, we are deciding on the person to comply with the Clean Air and the Clean Water Acts, the Endangered Species Act, to discharge their duties as the leader of the  Something happened today that changes this whole debate. In Federal law, there is something called FOIA, the public records law regarding Federal officials. Most State laws have some kind of open records law, and Oklahoma is no different. There was a lawsuit against the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, and it basically said: Listen, you have to disclose the emails between your office and a bunch of energy industry companies. And the context here is absolutely important. Scott Pruitt is not just a person who is bad on the issue of climate; this is a person who is a professional climate denier. This is a person who has made his bones, politically and professionally, trying to undermine all the authorities the EPA possesses. This is a person who is a plaintiff in multiple lawsuits, as the Oklahoma attorney general, against the This is a person who has not promised to recuse himself when he is running the So imagine that there are going to be pending lawsuits where he was the plaintiff, and they are going to still be before the He was asked in committee whether he would recuse himself, because obviously it is preposterous to be both the plaintiff and the defendant in a lawsuit. It just stands to reason. He did not promise to recuse himself.  So this is a person who has an incredibly close, uncomfortably close working relationship with the fossil fuel industry. He may have that as a sincerely held belief, but the Oklahoma State law requires that he disclose whom he is working with. Why is that relevant? Well, he actually had a couple of instances where he has taken language given to him, sent to him by email from oil companies, and he just copied it--select all, copy, drop it, paste it--onto Oklahoma attorney general letterhead, and then transmitted it to the EPA as if it were from the AG's office in So that is the context.  What did this Federal judge say today? An Oklahoma County district court judge said that according to the Oklahoma Open Records Act--Aletia Haynes Timmons from the district court of Oklahoma instructed Pruitt's office to hand over the emails by close of business next  So here we are, trying to jam through this nomination, and now it makes perfect sense why they wanted to run the clock. They had congressional delegation trips to Munich for the security conference. There were Republicans who were planning to meet with NATO allies. There was another overseas trip of great import. Yet they abandon all other obligations, all other objectives, and they are bound and determined to run this clock until 1 p.m. tomorrow because they need to vote before these emails become disclosed. Tuesday is when we will see these emails. Yet we seem to be in a[[Page S1276]]race to get this vote done tomorrow at 1 p.m. Something feels wrong about this. Something feels like they are worried about the contents of those emails.  Gosh, I hope I am wrong. I hope on Tuesday that these emails are perfunctory, professional, proper. I hope I am wrong. I hope my fears and suspicions about what may be in those emails are unfounded. But here we are in the so-called world's greatest deliberative body, and we decided we don't even need another 2 business days to deliberate or to gather more information.  This is a decision that will stick for 4 years. This is a nominee who will run one of the most important Federal agencies that there is, the one in charge of clean air and clean water. The person in charge of clean air and clean water has been corresponding with oil and gas and coal companies--nothing necessarily illegal or untoward about that, but he seems to not want people to know what the content of that correspondence was.  The context here is very, very important, and that is why I am asking that we delay this vote until every Member of the Senate can read and review these emails. I think it is very important that we understand what is in the contents of those emails because there are some things we know about Mr.I am going to try really hard not to impugn his personal motivation. I have no doubt he feels sincerely about the issues we are arguing about. I don't have any reason to believe he has personally done anything improper. But I think it is totally reasonable for us to just see what is in those emails next  This isn't that we are trying to drag this out for 6 weeks or 6 months. This isn't that we are trying to cook up an issue. I didn't know about these emails, actually, until I didn't know there was a court case. I was perfectly ready to say: Look, it looks like they have the votes. We will have our argument. Maybe we can persuade a couple of people--certainly Susan Collins has been a profile in courage here, and there are Members of the Senate on the Republican side who have been on the right side of climate. But you know what, all that gets washed away. All that gets washed away because you don't get to be on the right side of climate and vote for a climate denier for the Environmental Protection  And lest you think I am being a little bit overheated here in terms of who Scott Pruitt is, this is what Scott Pruitt has said about himself. He describes himself as a leading advocate against the EPA's agenda. On the role of the EPA he says:       I believe that the EPA has a role to play in our Republican      form of government. Air and water quality issues can cross      State lines, and can sometimes require Federal intervention.      At the same time, the EPA was never intended to be our      Nation's frontline environmental regulator.  That is kind of a well-put-together statement, but I want you to understand how radical of a statement that is, because the EPA was designed to be the Nation's frontline environmental regulation.  The basic premise is that there are certain things that can be done at the local level that ought to be done at the local level. When we configured our governments, we decided we want police forces and firehouses and other municipal services--sewer and water, and trash pickup--certain things get done locally. Some things get done at the county level. Some things get done at the State level. And what we have decided as a nation is that because pollution doesn't recognize municipal, State, or even Federal boundaries, that we actually need Federal law to make sure that if one State is polluting, it doesn't move over to the other So the idea that the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator, which is what Mr.Pruitt says, is actually quite radical. It is an intentional misunderstanding of what the EPA is for. It is intended to be our frontline environmental regulator.  Here is Mr.Pruitt on climate change:       Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists      continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global      warming and its connections to the actions of mankind. That      debate should be encouraged in classrooms, public forums and      the halls of  I have to hand it to Mr.Pruitt--he magnificently describes radical policies as though they are not radical. He is very skillful at that. He is very lawyerly at that.  He did very well, in my view, in the EPW Committee, but his views are essentially that the EPA is not the frontline in terms of protecting clean air and clean water, and that blows up the mission of the  I see the Senator from Rhode Island is here. I would be happy to entertain any questions he may have in a moment.  A couple more quotes from Mr.Pruitt on the Clean Power Plan:       The president could announce the most ``state-friendly''      plan possible, but it would not change the fact that the      administration does not have the legal authority under the      Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions.  ``[T]hat the administration does not have the legal authority for regulate carbon emissions.'' Factually wrong. Legally wrong. This has been settled. Massachusetts v. I left my law degree in my apartment, but I know Massachusetts v. EPA, and I know this is flat wrong. So what he says is totally radical. He is a skillful guy. I assume he is a good guy, but he wants to undermine the basic authorities of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water  I will finish with this quote before I yield for a question from the Senator from Rhode Island on methane regulation.       My concern is that the EPA is employing its flawed      methodology in order to rationalize new and unjustified      federal regulations to solve a methane emissions problem that      simply does not exist.  That has no basis in fact.  I see the Senator from Rhode Before I yield for his question, Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the Senators from Rhode Island and  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

1003,topic-id,275,"Well, I thank the Senator from Rhode I think one of the great challenges is that it is one thing to misunderstand the EPA's role here; that is dangerous enough as the attorney general of a State or the head of the Republican Attorneys General But when you are in the EPA and you have charge to administer the law, to discharge your duties under Federal law, to the degree and extent that you misunderstand the authorities in the Clean Air Act as either weaker than they may be or sort of optional--I mean, this is the issue in Massachusetts v.  For instance, the question around carbon was resolved. There were a couple of questions. First of all, is carbon an airborne pollutant? The Supreme Court and the EPA made their finding, and they determined that it was an airborne pollutant.  Once you determine that something is an airborne pollutant, it is not for the EPA, on a discretionary basis, to try to regulate that airborne pollutant. They are then required under Federal law to regulate that pollutant.  So part of the misunderstanding here is the question isn't, Is the EPA authorized to regulate carbon? It is, Are they required to regulate carbon? So he has it wrong doubly--first of all, on the law and second of all, on the science.  I think the danger of putting someone like that in a position of authority[[Page S1277]]is that they will preempt States, California and others--although California has some pretty significant carve-outs--but they will at least attempt to preempt the States from doing what they want to do to protect their clean air and their clean water.

1006,topic-id,370,"Well, I thank the Senator for that question. It is a really important one because essentially what Scott Pruitt is saying is: Hey, let's let the States handle this. But if you are to take him at his word, I think it is not unreasonable to say: Well how did you handle enforcement of either State or Federal environmental law as the top cop in the State of Oklahoma? Right?  He did two things that would cause everybody to question his commitment to even local environmental protection. The first thing he did when he came in as Oklahoma AG--a lot of offices the attorney general have environmental protection units. It is like a big law firm. They have different units that handle different kinds of crime. They have a civil division; they have a criminal division. They do lots of things. One of the divisions is to enforce environmental law. He disbanded it. He disbanded the State attorney general's division that enforces environmental law. Then he beefed up this thing that did not exist until he got there, which was essentially a division to undermine Federal authorities.  So you are right. He has them coming and going. He is making an argument that the State should be empowered to enforce environmental law. At least we could take that as kind of on-the-level federalism. We have some good Republican colleagues who just really believe that the government that governs least governs best. They think that local problems should be solved at the local level, even though, in my view, when it comes to air pollution and water pollution, that is essentially preposterous because pollution moves.  I really believe that for some of these Members it is a sincerely held belief. It is hard to believe this attorney general when he says: Hey, give us the authority to enforce our environmental laws, and then, when the rubber hits the road--which is how many lawyers you put on the job, how many cops you put on the beat--he basically eviscerates the division that enforces environmental law, and he beefs up this division that is basically a little shop that sues the EPA to undermine the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act federally.

1008,topic-id,1218,"Well, I think the Senator is right. You know, it is fair to look at his record. It is also fair to look at his words. In 2016--so this is not 10 years ago; this is less than a year ago--he said: Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make clean air.'' It is something that bothers me, that Congress then gives this general grant of authority to  Congress has given a general grant of authority to the That is what the law says. So, my concern, when it comes to Mr.Pruitt, is that he understands, as a member of the bar, as an attorney general, what the law says. He has been operating in a political context, I think it is fair to say, as the head of the Republican Attorneys General Working with energy companies, he has been very aggressive in cultivating friends across the country who are very enthusiastic about his nomination and potential confirmation.  But he totally misunderstands the mission of the It is granted by the Congress, a general authority to enforce clean air. That is what the EPA is, really; it is clean air, and it is clean water. That is what the EPA is about.  The thing I think is especially troubling for me when it comes to the politics of this, is that there was a bipartisan consensus for many, many, many years around the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water I believe the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act came under President George H.This used to be not very controversial because, actually, we can fight about the Iran deal, we can fight about women's reproductive health, we can fight about LGBT rights, we can fight about civil rights, we can even fight about foreign policy and the size and scope of the government, but even if you are an extremely conservative individual, you ought to believe, to the extent that we have government at all, that it should be responsible for keeping us safe and that it is a Federal role to make sure our air is clean and our water is clean.  So this person who is very skillful in kind of eluding--you know, he basically dodged punches in that EPW We have some very skillful members on the EPW committee. They are very knowledgeable, very passionate. It was rough, but he was able to avoid a sort of knockout blow. The reason is that he is a professional climate denier. This is what this guy has been training to do all of his life.  So, again: We like clean air, so go make clean air. That is something that bothers me.  The Congress then gives a general grant of authority to EPA on the Oklahoma environmental regulations. He said: Federal regional haze standards--if you live in Oklahoma, I understand. You did not vote for Barack Obama, but I don't think you thought you were voting to reduce air quality. So he says that Federal regional haze standards threaten the competitive edge Oklahomans have enjoyed for years with low-cost and reliable electric generation.[[Page S1278]]This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma manufacturers, but gives the State a considerable edge in recruiting jobs. He is the attorney general. He is supposed to enforce the law. I mean, that sounds like a Member of That sounds like a Member of the State legislature. But it does not sound to me like someone who is prepared to discharge their duties under the Federal law.  Another space where Mr.Pruitt has some alarming views is on science itself. I am deeply concerned about what is happening to science, to scientists, to government research. We just confirmed the Director of OMB who, in a Facebook post, wondered out loud--he had some questions about the Zika virus. I am not sure he had any special expertise to be raising these questions. We should all be researching and be as scientifically literate as possible, but the OMB Director put on his Facebook post: I have these questions. I am really interested in this, but the real question is whether we should have publicly funded research at all.  So there is a full-on attack on science and facts. There is a full-on attack on reality. But when it comes to environmental science, it is so consequential. I am looking at these pages sitting here. I think about everybody's children and grandchildren. We just have an obligation to get the data right, to really understand what is happening with air quality and water quality.  Here is what Mr.Pruitt says about mercury. ``Human exposure to methylmercury resulting from coal fired EGUs is exceedingly small.''  This is, again, the White Stallion Energy Center versus  This is what the scientists say: ``As a result of these long-term mercury inputs, there are hotspots and whole regions, such as the Adirondacks of New York, the Great Lakes region of the Midwest and large portions of the Southeast where the fishery is contaminated with mercury.''  There are more fish consumption advisories in the United States for mercury than all other contaminants combined.  I can tell you, just on a personal level, to the Senator from Rhode Island, that I like my ahi. I like my fresh sashimi. I like tuna, and everybody in Hawaii likes fish. So you kind of watch how much marlin you eat, how much ahi you eat because we understand that there is a real mercury problem. This isn't made up. If you talk to ER doctors in Honolulu, they have to deal with mercury poisoning on a weekly basis. That is what the science shows, and that is what the reality shows.  Here is what Mr.Pruitt says: ``The record does not support EPA's findings that mercury, non-mercury metals, and acid gas pose public health hazards.''  And here is what the scientists say: ``There is no evidence demonstrating a safe level of mercury exposure.''  So before yielding for a question, I think it is really important for all of us to understand what is at stake here. We have a nominee who is really unique in the history of the EPA because never before have we had a person who has made it their life's mission to undermine the Agency which they wish to lead.  You could probably argue that Mr.Puzder, who just withdrew his nomination yesterday, had a similar kind of attitude about the Department of  But even under Republican administrations, we have had Republican Administrators of the EPA who understood: Hey, look, the law is the Clean Air Act, the law is the Clean Water Act, the law is the Endangered Species Act, and I have an obligation, as the EPA Administrator, to accept those premises--right?--and to be the EPA Administrator, to not sort of be on my crusade against Federal law.  If he wants to undermine Federal law, he can go litigate that. He can be a private attorney or he could run for the Congress and try to be a lawmaker. But to the degree and extent that he wants to run the Agency with a specific statutory mission, he has to follow those statutes. And I have seen no evidence that he has any respect for or understanding of those statutes.  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Rhode  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,2173,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February
1010,topic-id,1278,"Well, I thank the Senator for the question.  This is what is happening today. It would be enough if we were in the process of debating and confirming a climate-denier to the It would be enough that this person is a plaintiff in 17 lawsuits against the It would be enough that he is a plaintiff in these lawsuits against the EPA and he refused to recuse himself if he is running the As Senator Markey says, he is going to be plaintiff, defendant, and judge in these lawsuits.  All of that would be enough, but today a judge is compelling him to release around 3,000 emails that have squarely to do with the debate that we are having, which is this: Is this person a little too close to the industry that he is going to regulate?  As I said before, gosh, I hope these emails, as they are disclosed, show nothing. I hope that my suspicions, my fears, my concerns are without foundation. But I think about the Republicans, the good Republicans on the other side of the aisle who are voting for this man tomorrow.  Boy, they had better hope there is nothing in those emails. They had better think very carefully about what is in those emails. They might want to delay this vote themselves because, look, if there is nothing in those emails, then we can vote two Mondays from now--no harm no foul. You have career professionals at EPA doing their job. EPA will run for another 5 or 6 business days. It is  We are the world's greatest deliberative body. We go slow on almost everything, and we are rushing on this. Why are we rushing?  Well, I was trying to figure out all week why we were rushing. Then I understood that the court was going to rule today, and they are jamming this. They are ramming this down the American people's throats.  I would just offer this to my Republican colleagues: These emails are going to be disclosed, and maybe you guys and gals know that there is nothing to be concerned about in terms of the content of these emails, where the Oklahoma attorney general is corresponding with a bunch of fossil fuel[[Page S1279]]companies. Maybe it is all good in those emails.  But the thing is, if that is the case, why did he refuse for 750 days to offer the emails up? I mean, it literally takes more work to not provide the emails than to provide the emails. You have to lawyer up to not do something. You are going to lawyer up as the Oklahoma attorney general to not comply with an Oklahoma statute. This takes a special effort.  Why would somebody want to undertake such a special effort to not comply with State law? I don't know. But I think we may find out on  Gosh, I hope I am wrong. But I have a feeling that the people who are most nervous right now about what is in those emails--in addition to the American public who care about clean air and clean water--are the Republicans who are being forced to vote at 1 o'clock without seeing them. They are being forced to vote on this person to run the EPA that they know is unpopular.  I mean, I understand that in some States this guy is tremendously popular because it is very easy to blast the In some portion of the Republican conference, Scott Pruitt is totally popular. I get that.  There is a nontrivial number of Members on the Republican side who actually don't want to be on the wrong side of the public when it comes to clean air and clean water, but they are going to be on the wrong side of the public when it comes to clean air and clean water. And it might get worse next  I really wonder why you would work so hard to not disclose the contents of 3,000 emails over a 750-day period.  I want to quote from Mr.Pruitt again on climate change:       Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled.  Here is what the scientists say: ``The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.'' This is from the U.National Academy of Sciences in 2005. This wasn't just some sort of recently arrived at conclusion.  Here is Mr.Pruitt again on climate:       We've had ebb and flow. We've had obviously, climate      conditions change throughout our history. That's scientific      fact. It gets cooler, it gets hotter. We don't know the      trajectory, if it is on an unsustainable course. Nor do we      know the extent by which the burning of fossil fuels, man's      contribution to that, is making this far worse than it is.  I mean, sorry, this is not what the scientists say. This is what I say. That is just bunk. There was a point at which that was a tenable position, even if it was scientifically bunk, easily 15 years ago. It was politically kind of workable 10 years ago--maybe even 8 years ago and, depending on your community, 5 years ago. But there is a majority of Republicans who understand the urgency of climate change.  The only place where the reality of climate change continues to be debated fiercely is in the halls of  Local people in every community across the country understand that this thing is settled fact. This thing is upon us. You don't have to be some wonk. You don't have to understand ocean acidification. You don't have to understand exactly what is going on. You just have to, A, listen to experts who know about climate, who know about weather, who know about atmospheric science. Even if you don't believe any of the experts, you just have to believe your own experience. There is not a person out there--whether they are a fisherman on the Big Island or a farmer in the Midwest or a hunter in the Southwest--there is not a person out there who isn't experiencing the weather getting strange.  Everybody understands that 1 day of weird weather does not climate change make. But there is just no doubt that severe weather and odd weather is getting more frequent and more odd and more severe.  Here is what the scientists say about climate change:       The scientific evidence is clear: Global climate change      caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a      growing threat to society.  Here is Mr.Pruitt again:       Is it truly man-made and is this just simply another period      of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? Is it      just typical, natural type of occurrences as opposed to what      the administration says?''  I mean, this is so far out of the mainstream that it would be funny if it weren't terrifying. It would be funny if it weren't terrifying to think that the person who is going to run the Environmental Protection Agency, the person who is going to be in charge of administering the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act is saying: Is it truly man-made and is this just simply just another period of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? I mean, is it just a natural type of occurrence, as opposed to what the Obama administration says?  I would be happy to yield to the Senator for a question. I will note that we have a joke where I am the good cop and he is the bad cop, but I think over time, we are merging.

1014,topic-id,923,"I want to make an observation that there are a couple of kinds of willful blindness. One is willful blindness about climate change in the first place, a desire not to hear the truth, a desire to put blinders on when it comes to these issues. I will note that not every time but almost every time we have a debate on climate, we have a nice complement of Democrats on this side and a totally empty Chamber on the other side. It is not that they don't know what is going on, it is that they know exactly what is going on, and they don't want to deal with it. They don't want to deal with it, and they are good people and patriotic people, but there is a reason to believe this willful blindness is not coincidental.  I would just implore the Senate Republicans who respect the Senate, who understand our special role under the Constitution to give advice and consent on nominations for Cabinet positions, that this isn't some minor sub-Cabinet position. This isn't some matter of little import. I understand both sides employ tactics to delay action on the Senate floor. That is kind of part of the way this body works, right? The minority slows the majority down, and we try to come to some kind of consensus, sometimes a unanimous consent agreement or whatever it may be, to try to make this place work a little better, and it is maddeningly slow, but it forces bipartisanship, right?  I understand the accusation that sometimes gets made that we are just trying to delay for delay's sake. At the beginning of this week--look, I ran for the Senate because of climate. That is how passionately I feel about this issue, but I understood how this thing was lining up, and I said: Look, let's fight the fight. There is no magic between 28 hours and 30 hours. There is no magic between 29 hours of talking about this and 26 hours of talking about this. I was prepared to fight the fight and move this week. I didn't want to employ extraordinary delay tactics. I was actually even arguing with some of my colleagues, with whom I agree so much on climate, about the sort of efficacy just delaying for another couple of hours, but we are not trying to delay another couple of hours for no particular reason. There are 3,000 emails that a judge in Oklahoma is compelling Scott Pruitt to provide to the public, and not 6 weeks from now or 6 months from now but 3 business days from now. On Tuesday morning, the public and, maybe in this instance even more importantly, the Members of the U.Senate, who are in a position to determine whether this is the right person to run the Environmental Protection Agency, are going to see the contents of these emails. Do you know what? It is probably nothing. These 3,000 emails that are correspondence between the Oklahoma attorney general, the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, and a bunch of fossil fuel companies--this guy who has sued the EPA and tried to undermine the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act 17 times, this guy who refuses to recuse himself from running the EPA, from being both a plaintiff and a defendant, I am sure the 3,000 emails he has delayed releasing for 750 days--I am sure the 3,000 e-mails he has delayed releasing for 750 days and is only going to have to provide them to the public because a court is making him, I am sure there is nothing in them. But just in case, why don't we just find out what is in them? Because it seems to me that if they are awful, it would give pause to  I just don't get why the Republicans--I understand why people want to jam this through before maybe something bad happens on Tuesday, but if I were a rank-and-file Republican, I would be saying: This looks a little goofy. We don't normally vote on Fridays at 1 p.m., we normally vote on Thursdays at 2:15 so everybody can race off to the Reagan airport and go home. If it is 2:15, I can't get home until Friday, but most people can get home. We vote on Thursday afternoons, and in rare instances do we vote on Fridays--debt ceiling, continuing resolutions, big stuff. We have been moving on nominees kind of at a normal pace. Listen, it has been tough. We have a lot of late nights here. We thank the Senate staff for hanging in here with us. We apologize for the difficulty that you have to undertake to make the Senate work and for us to do our constitutional duties, but isn't it weird that we are just jamming this through on a Friday afternoon?

I would say it is strange, in the extreme, to have the chief law enforcement officer of a State and the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association not comply with his own State statute. This isn't trivial. Not that it would be OK for the attorney general not to comply with any law, but this isn't a nontrivial issue. This is letting the public know the nature of your correspondence with industry--especially since I think it is fair to say that I think even he would agree that he has[[Page S1281]]distinguished himself among attorneys general as a lead advocate against the EPA and as an advocate for fossil fuel-generating companies. So it is not unreasonable for the public to say: Well, let me understand what the nature of your correspondence was.  My very basic question to the Members of the Senate on the Republican side is, Why in the world would we vote at 1 o'clock before we get these emails? I understand that if we had said, give us 6 months so we can see these emails, that would be preposterous. That would be us delaying for delay's sake. Listen, we feel so strongly, I think it is fair to say about this nominee that we might have even tried that, but then in that case the majority would be within their rights to say: We are not going to let you delay for delay's sake.

1022,topic-id,366,"I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for that question. The Senator is right that he has been delaying because he wants to be confirmed as the EPA Administrator before these emails become public. There is no other reason that I can think of that is so important that we get the EPA Administrator in. Remember, we have the HUD nominee, we have the Department of Commerce nominee, we have the Department of the Interior nominee, and we have the Department of Energy nominee, who has responsibility and stewardship over our nuclear arsenal. We have decided we are not going to run until Friday afternoon getting a person in charge as the Secretary of Energy to take care of our nuclear arsenal, but it is a really big hurry--and we have to literally prevent Members from meeting with NATO allies--to get this guy through. I really didn't understand earlier in the week what the big rush was and why Pruitt and why now.  Listen, every Wednesday we are in some kind of negotiation about what kind of legislation and what kind of matters come before the Senate, and both sides sort of puff up their chests and make threats about going through the weekend, and we usually come to some sort of agreement. Yet this week there was no budging, and now I get it. They were afraid this judge was going to do what this judge did. This judge is requiring these emails to come out, and I think they are terrified about what these emails say.  Do you know what? There is only one way to prove me wrong, which is to call our bluff and delay. Let's go two Mondays from now. We have a recess, and we will all read the emails. Then it will be great. We will find out that there was nothing untoward, nothing improper, nothing concerning about these 3,000 emails between the Republican attorney general from Oklahoma and these oil and gas and coal companies.

You had rivers catching on fire.  I went to college in Southern California in, I guess, 1990 through 1994, and the success of the Clean Air Act is incredible. I mean, L.still has its smog, but because of CAFE standards, because of the Clean Air Act, because of other environmental regulations, you don't have nearly the air quality problems that you had even 20, 25 years ago, and this is a nationwide success story.  Kids had to stay home from school because of air pollution. I know everybody understands that is happening in Shanghai and in Beijing, parts of Africa, parts of the developing world, parts of the industrializing world.

It strikes me that Governor McCall, President Nixon, I am thinking of Governor Schwarzenegger, I am thinking of Susan Collins, although I am almost sheepish to continue to single her out; it may not always be helpful to her to be singled out as the lone pro-climate person on the Republican side of the fence on this issue--but it strikes me that your beginning as an environmentalist was not based on being liberal or progressive, but your community's values, your family's values, your church's values, your Scout troop's values.  We had a really interesting lunch today with a preacher from North Carolina talking about framing political issues as moral issues. It really touched me because I am telling you, it breaks my heart to think--I mean, look, for some of these arguments about the size and the scope of the government, we just have different views on what the right size and scope and role of the Federal Government is. Some of these questions about geopolitics--tough stuff. You try to get it right. You try to have a coherent world view. Tough stuff. If you serve in the Senate long enough, you are going to get some stuff exactly right, and you may be wrong a few times.  But what really breaks my heart is to see the once-bipartisan consensus, which was based on common sense and morality that we just don't pollute our oceans, our streams, our aquifers, the air we breathe; that we try to preserve our environment for each other and for posterity; and a basic understanding that people who own businesses--especially once those businesses are incorporated and especially if those businesses are publicly traded--have a different set of imperatives. It is really hard to get each individual business that is in the mining industry or the electricity generation industry or the extraction industry or the transportation industry or the manufacturing industry to voluntarily worry every day about clean air and clean water. It is kind of like not their job. They are supposed to make stuff. They are supposed to extract stuff. They are supposed to make electronics. They are supposed to make this economy work.  So one of the ideas of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act is that we have an obligation to creation itself for those of us who are religious and for those of us who are not.

1095,topic-id,6893,"Mr.President, in late October, people who lived in a place called Donora shrugged off the thick, yellow smog that had covered their small town. It was 1948. It wasn't unusual to see a smog blanket the town, thanks to the zinc plant and the steel mill that smoked endlessly into the Pennsylvania sky. It wasn't unusual to see people coughing as they went about their day. As one reporter put it, ``People are always coughing in Donora.''  What was unusual is that the smog did not clear as the day went on. It lingered, hanging around the town, wreaking havoc for the next 5 days. At first, life seemed to go on. The Halloween parade went on as planned, even though no one could really see the people marching. The high school football game went on as planned, although the quarterbacks avoided passing plays since the wide receivers couldn't see the ball. But then someone died. People couldn't breathe. As the local hospital started to fill, the town hotel set up beds for overflow patients. By the fourth day, the hotel had to set up another emergency section--this time, a temporary morgue. The town's three funeral homes were overwhelmed. On the fifth day, the stacks of a zinc plant stopped their endless streams of smoke, and the smog that would become known as the Donora death fog finally lifted but not before nearly 7,000 people fell ill and 20 died.  This is one of the many stories that show us what life was like in the United States of America before the EPA was created. In the early 1960s, millions of freshwater fish and rivers around the country were poisoned by insecticides--hurting consumer trust and the countless fishermen and their families who relied on the fish to make a living. Pollution was so bad that debris floating in the Cuyahoga River actually caught on fire, causing thousands of dollars in property damage. The water in Lake Superior, one of the most beautiful lakes in the United States, became so toxic from companies dumping asbestos-laden waste that local communities had to start filtering their water. Think about that. People could drink the water from local reservoirs, unfiltered, until pollution came along. This was the path our country was on.  Pollution was destroying some of the most beautiful places in this country--on the planet, in fact--putting the health of the public and the health of our economy at grave risk.  There was another event in the early 1960s that helped our country to see clearly that the path we were on would only lead to destruction. Rachel Carson, scientist, public servant, and author, published a book called ``Silent Spring.'' This book laid out in simple, beautiful prose the threats that pesticides and pollution posed to our environment or what Carson called a ``Fable for Tomorrow.'' She wrote: ``The most alarming of all man's assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers and sea, with dangerous and even lethal materials.''  Carson's book made clear that we were contaminating the environment and that this could not go on. Her book sounded a call for change, as millions of Americans began demanding that the government take action, but there was also a backlash. Here is what one industry spokesman said as public opinion began to coalesce around addressing pollution:       The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring      are gross distortions of the actual facts, completely      unsupported by scientific experimental evidence and general,      practical experience in the field. Her suggestion that      pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is      obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without      selective biologicals, these compounds would be completely      useless.  This is how the controversy went on for the next few years. The public, the science, and the reality all pointed toward the truth, but a few loud voices persisted. They did not want the movement to go forward. This continued even after Rachel Carson passed away, tragically and prematurely, of cancer in the year 1964.  Here is what the New York Times published in her obituary:       The most recent flare-up in the continuing pesticide      controversy occurred early this month when the Public Health      Service announced that the periodic huge-scale deaths of fish      on the lower Mississippi River had been traced over the last      4 years to toxic ingredients and three kinds of pesticides.      Some persons believe that the pesticides drained into the      river from neighboring farm lands.       A hearing by the Agriculture Department of the Public      Health Service's charges ended a week ago with a spokesman      for one of the pesticide manufacturers saying that any      judgment should be delayed until more information was      obtained.  The line of argument captured in the New York Times is familiar to anyone who has watched our Nation struggle to come to a shared set of facts around a number of difficult issues, but even in the face of so much controversy, the country did the right thing. In addressing the threats to our environment, the U.Government--with substantial and commendable support from Republicans--began to lay the foundation for a new America, one that would preserve and protect our country and its resources for the next generation.  I would like to highlight three of the critical cornerstones in the foundation: the EPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water  Let's start with the EPA itself. It was established in 1970 by President He united several offices and bureaus already in the Federal Government into a single agency--one that[[Page S1316]]would oversee all of the laws, protections, research, and policies about the Nation's environment. The mission of the EPA was clear from the start, to protect human health and the environment. Almost immediately, something really exciting happened. There was a feeling of hope and anticipation for what this Agency could do for the country. Within the first few months, tens of thousands of resumes came flooding in from across the country as people clamored to work for the  Here is how one man who worked for the Agency described it:       There was a palpable sense of excitement that we were about      to do something big. We had to do things big because the      newspapers and news magazines were filled with stories about      Lake Erie dying. I think it was a year or two before that the      Cuyahoga had indeed caught on fire. I believe the Houston      Ship Channel had the same issue. We knew we were there to      really deal with substantial problems, and we were going to      meet with immediate pushback.  For the next 40 years, the EPA would build a legacy of preserving and protecting the country's air, water, and natural resources, working to make our country a better place to live.  I just want to say that whatever the final disposition of this nomination ends up being--and I know we will push as hard as we possibly can for the delay of this decision, until we are able to see the contents of Mr.Pruitt's emails as directed by the court this afternoon--but whatever the decision is of the Senate under advice and consent, it is really important that this be said: EPA employees still have an obligation under Federal law to do their job, to protect air and water, to administer the Clean Air and Clean Water Act, to enforce the Endangered Species We are confirming a head of an Agency, but this new head of an Agency is not the Emperor of the  This new head of an Agency has obligations under the statute to enforce the laws on the books, and he has a current role as the lead of the Republican Attorneys General Association and as a plaintiff in multiple lawsuits against the EPA, and that is a reason many of us object to his confirmation. If he is confirmed, every EPA employee has rights. They have whistleblower rights, they have protections, and they have obligations under the statute so that if this EPA tries to do anything unlawful, anything that contravenes the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, then all of the EPA employees are dutybound under the law to follow the law.  No one in the Federal Government should be forced to do anything unlawful, and we support the EPA employees, in particular, who we know work so hard and are so dedicated to such an important cause. We know they are under intense scrutiny and pressure, and I think it is worth saying that we support them but also that the law supports them.  One of the first actions of the Agency was to ban DDT, a pesticide used in World War At first, DDT seemed like a dream chemical. It was used to protect soldiers from pests and then to protect crops like cotton, but soon it became clear--thanks to Rachel Carson and others--that this chemical was creating far more harm than good. Public health was really in danger. The bald eagle and other wildlife were being poisoned, and the pests that were supposed to be put off from bothering the crops were adapting, becoming more resistant, even as the chemicals became more potent and ultimately more dangerous.  Thanks to the EPA, the use of DDT came to an end. The health of children, families, and wildlife immediately improved. The bald eagle slowly recovered, to the point where it is no longer a threatened or an endangered species.  The Agency also found a solution to acid rain, which was a major problem that killed fish, hurt American farmers, and caused damage to forests and infrastructure alike. After studies showed how high concentrations of lead were hurting our kids, the EPA took action to remove it from gasoline and from the air. Because of that action, lead levels in both kids and adults have dropped by more than 80 percent since the late 1970s. We have a lot more work to do on lead, but that is one of the many EPA success stories.  The EPA then took on secondhand smoke, banning smoking in indoor public places. It pushed the auto industry to design technology that would reduce the amount of pollution created by cars, a step that would reduce the amount of pollution per mile emitted by cars by up to 90 percent. It provides technical assistance to State and local governments that otherwise don't have the resources or the know-how to tackle problems on their own.  The Agency has also empowered the public through right-to-know laws that give people access to information about chemicals, toxic substances, and pollution in their own communities. After studies show how low-income and minority communities face greater environmental risks, the EPA formed an Office of Environmental Justice, dedicated to making these communities as safe as any other in the country. As is so often the case, this Federal Agency set the bar for the rest of the world on how governments can protect and preserve the environment.  One leader of the EPA who served under President George H.Bush recalled that the Agency worked with countries as varied as Morocco and Mexico to battle fires or spills. After the EPA sent people to help with a Russian spill that was impacting Estonia, the Prime Minister wrote the EPA a letter, saying their visit was the most important visit of any American's since Charles Lindbergh had flown from Russia to Estonia in 1933.  So the EPA has had incredibly important impacts, from boosting diplomacy around the world to protecting the lungs of little ones right here at home.  The second cornerstone of our efforts to protect the environment is the Clean Air Before the EPA opened its doors, States set their own standards for clean air, and most States had weak standards because they were in a race to the bottom to attract companies that didn't want to have to deal with the damage they caused. Imagine you are in a State and have three or four adjacent States and someone wants to cite a factory. Well, it is very difficult to have a strong environmental standard because that factory is no doubt going to find the place where they are allowed to pollute the most, which is why you have Federal standards. Not surprisingly, these low standards were fueling air pollution.  Every day, the average American takes between 17,000 and 23,000 breaths. If the air we are breathing is filled with toxic chemicals, we are at risk for cancer, birth defects, and damage to our lungs, our brain, and our nerves. That risk is even higher for people with asthma and for senior citizens.  Remember, humans are not the only ones that rely on clean air. Trees, crops, wildlife, lakes, fish are all at risk of damage when we have dirty air. So eventually the American public demanded that something be done to clean up our air.  In 1970, Congress on a bipartisan basis, passed the Clean Air This law, along with later amendments, makes up the complete Federal response to air pollution. It is a beautifully written law. It gives the EPA the authority to limit air pollutants and emissions from industry plants. It empowers the Agency to research and fund different approaches to keeping the air clean. It creates partnerships between Federal, State, and local governments to reduce air pollution. Who could argue with that?  As soon as it was passed, people knew that this law was a game changer. President Nixon said: ``I think that 1970 will be known as the year of the beginning, in which we really began to move on the problems of clean air and clean water and open spaces for the future generations of America.''  That is exactly what happened. The impact was actually felt very quickly, starting with the auto industry. The Clean Air Act called on the auto industry to drastically reduce the amount of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and other harmful chemicals that came out of the tailpipes across the country within 5 years.  Consider that today there are more than three times the amount of cars on the road than they were in the 1970s. Now imagine that the chemicals coming out of each of those car's tailpipes were 90 percent more harmful. That is where we would be without the Clean Air  It was not so long ago that communities would cancel high school for kids because the air pollution was so bad, not in Beijing but in That is no longer the case, not for numerous[[Page S1317]]reasons, not for a dozen or so causes but because of the Clean Air This law has literally saved millions of lives. It has improved the health of millions of others.  Because the EPA has been there to enforce it, air pollution has fallen by 70 percent since 1970. Smog levels in Los Angeles have fallen from their peak by two-thirds. Nationwide, lead in our cars is down 98 percent, carbon monoxide is down 85 percent, sulphur dioxide is down 80 percent, acid rain is down 50 percent, and all at a fraction of anticipated costs.  Let me make two points here. First of all, it is actually rare that a law works this well. I mean, it is hard to make a good law. Everybody talks about it as a sausage-making process; you don't want to see what goes into it. But not all laws work over time.  This law actually worked. This law actually cleaned up our air. That is a really important thing to remember. If you undermine this law, if you undermine the agency that enforces it, the air does not clean up itself. This is not an automatic thing. The air is clean because the government protects the air.  I understand that, including the Presiding Officer and many Members of the Republican Party, we have tough debates about how big the government should be, what its responsibility should be. But if you go from Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, to Rand Paul, the sort of Republican libertarian--and I am not sure if you just sat down and had a cup of coffee with either of them or everybody in between on the political spectrum, in terms of their view of what the Federal Government ought to do, gosh, I can't imagine that anybody--if you kind of get them in a private moment--does not think that it is a Federal role to keep the air clean.  There are moments where I see a program within a Federal agency and I might love it, right, because of my political persuasion. But I can understand how a Ben Sasse or a Rand Paul or a Marco Rubio might object to it because they might say: Well, that sounds like a good idea, but my goodness, if that is so important, why don't we let communities decide whether or not to do that?  This is not one of those issues. Go and talk to your constituents about whether they want clean air. I don't know that you are going to find too many Republicans out there--I mean voters, not elected officials--voters, who think clean air is, take it or leave it, not a Federal role.  The truth is, that first of all, clean air is important enough to make a Federal law about in the first place. But there is also a technical reason, not a very complicated technical reason, but a technical reason that you need a Federal law that is about clean air as opposed to a State-by-State patchwork, and that is because the air travels. You cannot pollute in one State and expect that it will not impact the other  So one State having tough clean air standards doesn't really function in terms of the ecology because pollution knows no boundaries. The same study that I referred to found that air pollution has improved in the United States, thanks to environmental protection. But our work is not done. Nearly 90,000 people every year in the United States are at risk of a premature death because of air pollution. That number will rise if we chip away at this basic foundation.  The third and final cornerstone of that foundation is the Clean Water It is really important to remember how bad things were before the Clean Water I mean, we are not where we need to be in terms of protecting our water resources. But it is kind of unfathomable how bad it was before this law was passed.  Water in communities across the country was dirty. You could not swim or fish in two-thirds of the lakes, rivers, and coastal waters in the country. You couldn't swim or fish in two-thirds of the lakes, rivers, and coastal waters in the country. That is a data point that you would expect in a country that is still industrializing, that just doesn't have the pollution controls.  When you go to certain parts of the planet and you see essentially a very dirty environment, you would assume two-thirds, maybe more, of those lakes and streams and waterways are too polluted to fish or swim. But this is the United It was allowable to dump untreated sewage into open water. You could dump untreated sewage into open water before the Clean Water  But that changed in 1972, when what is now known as the Clean Water Act became law and cleared the way for the Federal Government to restore and protect the health of our water.  According to a study by the Aspen Institute, the Clean Water Act stopped billions of pounds of pollution from fouling the water and dramatically increased the number of waterways that are safe for swimming and fishing. Twenty years ago, you would have had to have a death wish to go swimming in Boston Today, you don't have to think twice. That is because of the Clean Water  But this is not just about enjoying the beauty of the water that it provides to so many communities, although not is not a small thing. Look, a lot of people--left, right, and center--people who are not political, people on the progressive side, people on the conservative side, people like lakes. People like the beach. People like the ocean.  It is not unreasonable, whoever you voted for, to think that there are a few things that government should do: They should probably have some kind of transportation infrastructure. There should probably be a law enforcement function. Make sure that the water is clean, the air is clean, and we have some national defense. Right? That is some basic stuff. Even if you are a libertarian, if you are not nuts, you think that the government should do a couple of very basic things, and among them is to keep the water clean.  I wanted to share some interactions I have had with the craft beer industry. They wrote a letter this week about how important clean water is to them. Here is a section of it:       Beer is about 90 percent water, making local water supply      quality and its characteristics such as pH and mineral      content, critical to beer brewing and the flavor of many      classic brews.       Changes to our water supply--whether we draw directly from      a water source or from a municipal supply--threaten our      ability to consistently produce our great-tasting beer, and      thus, our bottom line.       Protecting clean water is central to our business and our      long-term success. Not only does great-tasting beer we brew      depend on it, but so do the communities in which we operate.  Some of the largest and best craft breweries in the country signed onto this letter, from the Allagash Brewing Company in Maine to the New Belgium Brewing Company in They are right to be concerned because it will not take much for our water to go back to where it was in the 1970s. So it is in the interest of many industries for our country to have clean water, but not all of them.  Publicly traded companies will do the minimum. In a lot of ways, the way these companies are set up, they are actually obligated under the law to do the minimum. They have to maximize shareholder profit. They have boards of directors, they have earnings reports, they have quarterly obligations. Whether you like it or not, that is the way our system works. So, if you have a fiduciary obligation to maximize profits, then you may give short shrift to environmental concerns.  Compliance costs money. So most companies will comply only if they have to. If they are good companies, they feel that their obligation is to sit down with their lawyers and have the lawyers explain to them what they must do to comply.  But it is a rare company that says: Hey, I want to do much more than that. I mean Patagonia is great. There are other companies that do good work in the environmental space. But let's be very clear: There are a handful of companies that are so motivated, either as a brand strategy or a mission-driven approach, that they are going to exceed their obligations under the law. Most companies are going to do what is required under the law and not much more.  We can count on someone saying on a board of directors in some corner office or someplace on Wall Street: Hey, we can save 3 percent here if we don't clean the water. That is why we need a Clean Water That is why we need the It is not a matter of left or right; this is a matter of right or wrong. This is a matter of clean or dirty.[[Page S1318]]  This is especially important because our work is not done. We still have a ways to go. We still can't swim or fish in about one-third of our waterways. So these three cornerstones--this foundation of more than 40 years of progress--have prepared us to tackle what is the challenge of our lifetime, climate change. There was a time when this was primarily the concern of the conservation minded among us, people like me: hikers, swimmers, surfers green groups, bird and butterfly people. Right? I understand that.  There was a time where this was mostly an ecological concern. You had science people, you had hiking types who said: Hey, this thing is happening. I read Al Gore's book. This is a big deal. They were 10 years ahead of the curve. But climate change is no longer just an ecological issue; it is an economic issue. It is a quality of life issue. It is an American way of life issue. It is causing real harm to people and costing us billions of dollars now--not in the future, but now.  In recent years, the United States has experienced a record number of devastating storms, extreme temperatures, severe floods and lasting droughts. It is not a coincidence. As the climate changes, normal weather patterns are altered, and this affects our environment, our health, and our economy by influencing everything from the price of produce at the grocery store to our home insurance rates.  So we know that climate change is real. The science makes that clear. In fact, our own personal experience makes that real. A lot of people fish or hunt or hike or surf or snorkel or go to the lake or just go outside and experience something that seems to be changing.  There is a difference between weather and climate. The weather is tomorrow morning's temperature and whether it is raining or not and whether it is windy or not. The climate is the conditions that create the weather. It is not arguable anymore by anybody credible that the climate has changed and, therefore, the weather is getting absolutely more volatile.  Now we can, unfortunately, rely on our own experience and our own eyes to confirm that the climate and the weather are getting weirder--in some cases, more dangerous and certainly more unpredictable. Make no mistake, this is caused by humans, and that means we can do something about it.  Climate change deniers need to know that they are on the wrong side of history. They can't just cite the cost of transitioning to a clean energy economy--a cost that continues to decline, I should point out--while ignoring the cost of doing nothing, because the cost of doing nothing on climate change is absolutely astronomical, whether in storm aid, infrastructure mitigation, private property loss, or disruption in financial and insurance markets. It is much less expensive to move toward a clean energy economy than to allow severe weather to drain our economy as a whole.  As a Senator from the State of Hawaii who has led the way in building a clean energy infrastructure--producing clean, renewable energy and cutting our dependence on fossil fuels--I know that we can achieve meaningful change across our Nation, but we need the EPA and an Administrator to achieve this.  By law, the EPA has the authority to take steps to cut any pollution that threatens human health and welfare, including carbon pollution. Even the Supreme Court agreed that if EPA found carbon pollution to be a danger, the Agency was obligated to act to reduce the threat. So EPA has begun undertaking efforts to rein in those emissions.  Every protection that the EPA creates is the result of years of scientific inquiry, stakeholder involvement, public comments, and technological feasibility studies.  For all the talk of Federal overreach, EPA gives an enormous amount of authority to the For instance, in the Clean Power Plan, EPA sets emissions targets--that is true--but it was up to each State to develop a plan that is best suited to its unique circumstances.  The State of Hawaii has a really unique situation because we have lots of clean energy opportunities. But in terms of baseload power, we get all of our fuel from Asia, and it is It is low sulfur fuel oil. So what we do is we bring in oil on tankers, which is costing three and a half times the national average for electricity, and we light it on fire, and that creates electrons. That is not smart. So we are in a transition.  But there are other States that have geothermal resources or biofuel resources. So the EPA said: Hey, carbon is a pollutant. You have to reduce carbon pollution because, under the law, under the Clean Air Act, any airborne pollutant must be regulated, right? You have to reduce the airborne pollutants.  The EPA said: You have to do this over time, but we understand you are going to have your own energy mix and your own challenges. All you have to do is submit a plan that is kind of like thought through. So West Virginia's plan is different from California's plan and is different from Hawaii's plan. They empowered the States to endeavor to come up with their own energy mix.  Here is the good news about EPA's rules. This news is on the Clean Air It is on the Clean Power This is always the case. It always comes in below the estimated cost because what happens is, if you tell industry to innovate, even if they don't want to, frankly, even if they complain about it, even if they tell you that it is going to crash the American economy, which they often say, they end up driving innovation in the private sector.  In the case of electricity generation and transportation, the Clean Power Plan and the CAFE standards, the fuel efficiency standards for cars, accelerated the technological transition that was already underway.  Here are a couple of examples. When the auto bailout came in, President Obama negotiated very hard for an increase in fuel efficiency standards. You can imagine that the American auto industry was basically on the ropes. It was about to die without a major bailout. So they got the bailout, but there were also some strings attached, which were that they bring up fuel efficiency standards. They freaked out. And you know what happened? They met the standards. And you know what happened after that? The American auto industry has never been stronger because people like fuel-efficient cars, right?  What has happened with the Clean Power Plan and with the Paris climate accord and the investment tax credit and the production tax credit is that the cost of solar and wind energy is declining. But when utilities began thinking about long-term investments in a carbon-constrained world, the increased demand for clean energy drove down these costs even further, which is good for both consumers and the environment. In fact, more solar capacity was added in 2016 than any other energy source, by far. Solar and wind combined to make up almost two-thirds of the new capacity last year.  I want people to understand that the clean energy revolution is underway. The only question is whether we are going to have to take a 4-year break from this clean energy revolution and give the keys to the car to China and other countries, which would be pleased to let the United States abdicate its role as the leader of the clean energy revolution. We are going to lose all of those solar jobs, we are going to lose the innovation opportunities, and we are going to lose all of those wind energy opportunities.  The question is not whether we are going to make a transition to clean energy. The question is how quickly and whether the United States will drive it or not.  Consumers loved the first generation of hybrid vehicles so much that there were waiting lists to buy them. CAFE standards, along with similar fuel economy standards around the world, drove the automotive industry to innovate even further. Now we have unprecedented numbers of hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles on the road, and we stand at the precipice of a new age of electric vehicles.  So we find ourselves at a crossroads. If we continue down the path President Obama set us on, I have no doubt that American ingenuity and innovation will allow us to continue to lead the world in the clean energy economy, but if we turn back the clock and hand our future back over to the dirty fuels of the past, we will cede economic leadership to China, India, Germany, and the[[Page S1319]]rest of the world. Those countries are moving toward clean energy so quickly that we may never catch up; we may never be able to take full advantage of the economic opportunities that clean energy represents. It is sad, but it is true, that this is the path that our country will go on if Scott Pruitt is confirmed to lead the  I know for the public, after so many troubling nominees, that it is hard to wake up outraged for yet another nominee. But the reason to freak out about this one is very simple--clean air and clean water. Ask anyone who lived in L.or in Boston since the 1970s, and they can tell you that our country has clean air and clean water because of the laws that were put in place and the Agency that has done its job to implement them.  All of this will be in jeopardy with Scott Pruitt at the helm. He made his political bones trying to shred the EPA's ability to enforce the laws that protect clean air and clean water. Now this administration wants to give Mr.Pruitt the ultimate opportunity to lead the Agency that he has worked so hard to undermine. And he hasn't hidden the fact that he is utterly opposed to the  Let me highlight four statements that he has made that illustrate this point. He said: ``The EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''  The reality is that the opposite is true. The EPA was created for exactly that reason. Before the EPA existed, there were a number of offices and bureaus across the Federal Government that worked on protecting the environment, but the government saw--Congress saw--that it wasn't enough. Our Nation's waters were polluted, and the air was not clean. People were getting sick and even dying because there wasn't enough being done to protect the environment. So the intention behind the EPA was absolutely to put a single Agency on the frontlines of protecting and preserving clean air and clean water.  Not only does Mr.Pruitt disagree with the very mission of the EPA, but he also doesn't seem at all interested in the work being done by this He was asked during the confirmation process to name a single protection on the books at the Here is his answer:       I have not conducted a comprehensive review of existing EPA      regulations. As attorney general, I have brought legal      challenges involving EPA regulations out of concern that EPA      has exceeded its statutory authority based on the record and      the law in that matter.  I mean, just as a parent--forget my job as a Senator--as a parent and as a citizen, this really concerns me. I don't want to see the EPA led by someone who is basically given a softball question in the confirmation hearing: Name something you like about the But he declines to go on the record supporting clean air or clean water.  I mean, you would think that he could just say: Well, I like the Clean Water Act; I like the Clean Air He could even offer caveats, saying: I think there has been overreach, and I think there needs to be a recalibration. Say whatever you want, but he couldn't even bring himself to say he supports the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water That was the second comment that he made that was disturbing.  The third one relates to a Federal standard that targets pollution that decreases visibility. Mr.Pruitt had this to say about these standards:       [They] threaten the competitive edge Oklahoma has enjoyed      for years with low-cost and reliable electric generation.      This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma      manufacturers, but gives our State a considerable edge in      recruiting new jobs.  What Mr.Pruitt is referring to is actually another reason why the EPA was created in the first place. When States were in charge of environmental protections, it was often a race to the bottom. Everyone would try to lower their standards so that companies would move plants and factories to their And the result is exactly what you would imagine. Companies were happy to meet the lowest standard possible, leaving huge messes for the State to clean up, and that is not a good use of our taxpayer dollars.  It isn't the government's job to allow companies to make a huge mess and say: Hey, we will clean that up for you. There is no need to clean it up. We have it.  Let's look at how this has worked out for I would like to read an article by journalist, author, and climate expert Eric Pooley, which was published by Time magazine:       Mercury is a deadly neurotoxin that damages the brains of      the ``developing fetus and young children,'' according to the      American Academy of It is spewed into the air      from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources      before settling into lakes and waterways and contaminating      the fish we eat.       But Pruitt's challenges against the EPA's mercury standards      include a tidy piece of scientific denial, claiming ``the      record does not support the EPA's findings that mercury . . .      pose[s] public health hazards.''       After that legal challenge failed, Pruitt sued a second      time to block the mercury rules--even though virtually all      power plants had already complied with them at a fraction of      the expected cost.       Thanks in part to the EPA rules Pruitt opposed, mercury      levels in Atlantic Bluefin tuna are rapidly declining.  This isn't an abstract thing. If there are high mercury levels in fish and people eat the fish, they actually get the mercury poisoning. This happens in Honolulu all the time. We like our fish. And people go to the ER all the time. They don't know what it is, and it turns out that it is mercury poisoning.       But Oklahomans aren't so lucky. While Pruitt was busy      trying to kill national mercury rules, the number of Oklahoma      lakes listed for mercury contamination was climbing. This      year, the state lists 40 lakes with fish consumption      advisories due to mercury levels--up from 19 listed in 2010.      Eight lakes were added just this year.       Another Attorney General might have been trying to identify      the sources of the pollution. But Pruitt was apparently too      busy suing the       Pruitt also attacks limits on ground level ozone. The      ground level ozone--better known as smog--despite the fact      that ozone problems are huge and worsening in The      latest American Lung Association report gave all Oklahoma      counties surveyed an ``F'' for ozone problems and found that      the number of high ozone days had increased in most counties      as compared to 2010 to 2012.  The argument in this article can be boiled down to a single phrase: With Mr.Pruitt leading the EPA, we can bet that as goes Oklahoma, so goes the I can't speak for the people of Oklahoma, but I can say that when it comes to these kinds of statistics on polluted air and water, we would like to pass. If you ask most people in this country, they would agree that this is not the kind of environment they want their kids to grow up in.  The fourth disturbing statement Mr.Pruitt has made is about lead. Because of the EPA we have seen lead levels in both kids and adults drop by more than 80 percent in the past few decades. This is one of the legacy achievements of this This is something the next leader of the EPA should understand, but the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr.Cardin, raised this during a confirmation hearing. The Senator asked Mr.Pruitt if ``there is any safe level of lead that can be taken into the human body, particularly a young person.'' Another softball question.  Here is how Mr.Pruitt answered him: ``Senator, that is something I have not reviewed nor know about.'' This is pretty alarming because clearly he does not understand that in just 30 years this is an issue that the EPA has taken on as a high priority. This is an issue that we need the next leader to take seriously so we don't see any kind of backsliding. If you look at Mr.Pruitt's actions, they do, in fact, speak loudly about his approach to the Here is another news report:       The new administration is reportedly looking to close the      Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and instead      let individual program offices handle enforcement. The outlet      inside EPA quoted ``a source familiar with the plan'' who      says the Trump administration intends to ``disassemble the      enforcement office . . . take it, break it up, and move it      back into the program offices.''       Environmental advocates were quick to point out that Scott      Pruitt--the Oklahoma Attorney General Trump picked to lead      the EPA--made almost the same move back home. Pruitt closed      his office's Environmental Protection Unit not long after he      took office in 2011.  Mr.President, how much time do I have remaining?  The PRESIDING The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,2173,BRING HADAR HOME,2017.0,16.0,February

Mr.Pruitt's new unit has been quite active. Their office has filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the He has sued the EPA because of the way it tackles cross-state air pollution and the Agency's limits to oil and gas pollution. He sued to allow air pollution when facilities start up, shut down, malfunction, and to stop plans to address air pollution in his home  He sued the EPA because he disagrees with the Clean Power Plan, which will prevent an estimated 90,000 asthma attacks every year while saving American families money on their electric bill. He sued EPA to end protections against carbon pollution from new powerplants, even though these protections will cost companies very little to implement, and he challenged the clean water rule, which the EPA says protects the streams and wetlands that form the foundation of our water resources.  This is not a comprehensive list. I think there are 17 lawsuits he has filed. Guess what. Some of them are still pending. Mr.Pruitt was asked: Will you recuse yourself from the lawsuits in which you are the plaintiff? And he refused. So he is going to be the plaintiff and the defendant.  I am sure Mr.Pruitt is a good person, I am sure he is good to his family, but he also needs to be good to the American people and faithful to the law: the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species This is the foundation of what the EPA does. He doesn't get to have an opinion about those laws. He gets to implement those laws. If he wants to run for office, he can run for office and change those laws. If he wants to referee what authorities exist on those lawsuits, he can litigate, but if he is going to be the EPA Administrator, he has to check his ideological baggage at the door, and there is only one way we can be sure that he will not take his biases to the  I don't understand why in his confirmation hearing he didn't say: Look, anywhere I brought suit, anywhere I am a plaintiff, I am out. It is not unusual for a nominee to say on certain issues: I will recuse. There is ample precedent. It was done this year. It is also just plain common sense. It is the moral thing to do, the ethical thing to do, and it is politically smart because it is a problem that this person wants to remain plaintiff and defendant.  So it is disappointing and it is worrying. The agenda needs to uphold the Agency's mandate not to dismantle what the EPA has already done.  Senator Booker asked Mr.Pruitt how many kids in Oklahoma had asthma. Fair question to ask when you consider how many lawsuits Mr.Pruitt has filed against the EPA that if he wins will increase air pollution, and you can bet that more air pollution will hurt those kids who already have trouble breathing. Mr.Pruitt did not know how many kids in his home State have asthma, but here is the answer: 1 in 10--1 in 10 kids have asthma.  If Mr.Pruitt takes over the EPA, he is no longer responsible for just the kids in Oklahoma who have asthma. He is also responsible for the kids across the country and in my home State of There are millions of people in the United States who suffer from asthma, and for each and every one of them, not to mention the countless others at risk, Scott Pruitt guarantees that it will become harder to breathe. Scott Pruitt is going to guarantee that it becomes harder to breathe because he has sued the EPA to end the regulations that keep our air clean enough for us to breathe. Never before in the history of the Environmental Protection Agency has a President nominated someone so opposed to the mission of the Look, this administration has made it very clear where it stands on climate, on science, on protecting clean air and clean water.  We have seen climate change called the Chinese hoax. We have heard rumors that scientists will be muzzled and research stopped. We have seen the President sign a law that allows oil companies to hide what kinds of payment it is making to foreign governments in exchange for extracting oil. So there is no question that dirty energy is preferred by the current administration, but that doesn't mean the Senate has to be a rubberstamp here.  We are the Senate, and the United States Senate has a specific role under our Constitution and in our history. There comes a time where issues related to party have to be subsumed by issues related to the health and welfare of the country, and we have strayed from the bipartisan consensus that existed for decades and decades and decades, the basic premise that it is an American value in every small town, in every urban place from coast to coast, and everywhere in between, everybody likes clean air and clean water. Everybody at some point on a weekend wants to drive someplace or walk someplace and just be outside and be able to take a deep breath, enjoy your family, enjoy your friends, enjoy not having to work for 2 or 3 hours--go fishing, go hunting, go hiking, go surfing, go snowboarding, go skiing, whatever it is that people like to do to kind of restore themselves, that depends on our commitment to a legacy, and it depends on a commitment to these statutes. It really does. It depends on our commitment to the Clean Air Act and to the Clean Water Act and to the Endangered Species  I will just close with this. I have never seen the Senate in such a rush when there is not an actual deadline. I mean, we hurry when the government may shut down--and sometimes we screw that up too--but usually when we are in a hurry like this, when we are doing all night, there is a reason for it. I think it is just weird that congressional delegation trips overseas were canceled, multiple Members on a bipartisan basis were supposed to be meeting with NATO allies about 2 hours from now, but all of that got canceled.  Normally our vote is on a Thursday afternoon or a Friday morning, and this vote is at 1 p.m. on That is because somebody is bound and determined to get this vote done before those 3,000 emails between Scott Pruitt and a bunch of energy companies are disclosed. It is not a theoretical thing anymore. There was some talk about whether this was going to be disclosed. Now a judge is ordering that these emails get disclosed. Now everybody seems to be in an incredible hurry to make sure that we conduct this vote before those emails are disclosed.  I was talking to Senator Whitehouse and Senator Murphy about the content of those emails. I don't know what is in those emails, but here is what I know. I know the attorney general spent 750 days trying not to disclose those emails. I know they are between him and a bunch of energy companies. I know there seems to be a strong motivation on the Republican side to conduct the vote before we get the emails. And in the world's greatest deliberative body, it seems absolutely reasonable and consistent with our constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent on nominees and especially for a Cabinet position as important as this.  It just seems like we should probably wait to see what is in those emails. If I were a Republican on the other side, I would be very uncomfortable casting a ``yes'' vote, and I would be waking up Tuesday morning, probably at 1 a.m., and checking on the Internet and hoping there was nothing explosive in those emails. I hope there is nothing explosive in those emails. I don't want to know that we just confirmed someone who is inappropriate for the EPA, but we are going to know by  If my concerns are not well-founded, great. We can vote two Mondays from now, and we will have a new EPA nominee, but why not wait to find out what is in the emails. So I urge a ``no'' vote tomorrow, but more than that, I urge that we give ourselves the time to deliberate and to be a  I yield the floor.

1710,topic-id,678,"Mr.President, 20 is the number of bomb threats that were called into Jewish institutions in our communities across the country yesterday--in just 1 day. In Alabama, Delaware, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia, and in my home State of Hawaii, in my Temple Emanu-El, where I grew up and was bar mitzvahed. No one wants to be the parent who picks up the phone and finds out that they need to pick up their child from school because people are threatening violence--and all because of their faith.  Since 2017 began, 100 bomb threats have been called into Jewish schools and Jewish community centers. It sounds like it is from another time, but this is what rising anti-Semitism looks like in our country. Granted, we knew weird stuff was happening: Pepe, David Dukes--this is not normal But now the threat of violence is real. It is coming through the phone lines of American schools every day, and it is loud and clear. This rising threat demands leadership. It demands that we regularly and quickly denounce anti-Semitism and do everything we can do to stop it from growing. But that is not what we have seen so far from this administration.  Now, the baseline expectation of an unequivocal, quick and regular disavowal of rising anti-Semitic or anti-Muslim rhetoric from the leader of the free world is no longer being met. Instead, we have to extract it from the administration. We have to ask for it when it doesn't come. We have to ask when it is coming. What is even sadder is that this administration has avoided any opportunity--even the easy ones, even the most obvious ones--to stand against anti- Just over a month ago, the world marked International Holocaust Remembrance The White House put out a statement without a single mention of the 6 million Jews who were killed in the Here is the crazy thing: The first draft mentioned The State Department drafted the initial statement which mentioned Jews, like every Holocaust Remembrance Day statement before it did. Then it went to the White House where someone thought: Let's make edits. Let's remove mention of Jews from a statement about International Holocaust Remembrance This was someone's decision. It was an intentional decision. Who would decide that, and why would that be done?  Why remove the mention of Jews? It is like mentioning slavery and not mentioning African It is like mentioning internment and not mentioning Japanese When you are talking about genocide, it is not irrelevant to talk about who did it and to whom. It is a requirement. But the White House didn't mention Jews, and it didn't apologize when people were rightfully confused. Only now that violence has been unleashed, that Jewish cemeteries are being desecrated, that people's children are being threatened on a daily basis are we seeing the minimum from the White House to recognize the rise of anti-Semitic sentiments and actions.  I am worried.  Local communities have taken it upon themselves to lead the way and stand up together. This is what leadership looks like. It looks like Muslim Americans showing up to cemeteries to help to restore Jewish headstones. It looks like local police raising money and people taking time to hold a vigil in solidarity with their Jewish neighbors. There have been far too many bystanders to the increasing anti-Semitism across the country. It is long past time to break the silence and to make it utterly clear that the United States is not a place for hate. It is un-American to hate Jews or Muslims or strangers in our midst. That is not who we are or what we stand for. That is not the United States of  This week, as Jewish communities are reviewing bomb threat guidance and looking at best practices for security, it is up to all of us to take action and to do everything we can to beat back rising anti- I yield the floor.

203,topic-id,909,"Mr.President, I thank the Democratic whip for his remarks, and I will have much more to say on the circumstances surrounding General Flynn's resignation as National Security Advisor later today.  This morning, I rise to speak about the nominee on the floor, Representative Mulvaney, to be the Director of  Each nominee who comes before this body seems to be another indication of a Cabinet whose ideology is so far removed from the American mainstream and whose ethical conduct is more questionable than any other in our Nation's history. Representative Mulvaney is a walking demonstration of both shortcomings in this  First, on his views, which are way out of touch with most Americans, with average Representative Mulvaney has been a consistent ideological warrior against crucial safety net programs like Social Security and He said it plain as day: ``We have to end Medicare as we know it. . . . Medicare as it exists today is finished.''  That is from his mouth, and President Trump appoints this man head of OMB, one of the most powerful agencies in the government. Not only has Mr.Mulvaney advocated for cutting benefits, he wants to jack up the retirement age for Medicare to 67, and for Social Security he wants to raise it to 70.  After the confirmation of Representative Price to lead HHS last week, the confirmation of Representative Mulvaney will be the launch of week 2 of the Republican war on seniors.  Let's be clear. These are fringe positions, way out of touch with how most Americans feel about these programs, and it just proves that when our Republican colleagues go back home to campaign, not one of them says: Raise the age to 70. I don't see Republican ads saying that. They say they are going to protect Well, where are they now? You can't go home and campaign one way and then vote for Mulvaney, who wants to do the opposite and hurt our seniors--a war on seniors.  Literally, tens of millions of Americans rely on these programs and don't want to see their benefits cut. Millions more are on the cusp of retirement and know it is deeply unfair to move the goalpost on qualifying for these programs--changing the rules in the middle of the game--to hurt those who have spent their whole lives working and are now looking forward to receiving Social Security and That is not what most Americans voted for, whether they pulled the lever for Secretary Clinton or Mr. Candidate Trump promised that he was ``not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,'' but then he turns around and nominates a man to OMB who has relentlessly argued the opposite. He nominates a Secretary of Health and Human Services who has also argued that, with all of our Republican colleagues voting for him--none of us. So if people think Donald Trump is going to be a defender--I saw the AARP ads--I would like those ads to mention the nominations of Mulvaney and If people think Donald Trump is going to be a defender of Social Security and Medicare, these nominees seem to indicate a far different approach.  Candidate Trump didn't run as a far-right conservative. He ran as a populist against both establishments, but both Representative Mulvaney and Representative Price were plucked out of the very conservative wing of a very conservative House caucus and will be placed in charge of the budget and every American's healthcare--where they can effectively wage the war on seniors they have been plotting throughout their careers.  Unfortunately, both the OMB Director and the Secretary of HHS have hundreds of ways that don't go through the Congress of undercutting Medicare and Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in particular. They can undercut them in a whole variety of different ways. Given their ideology and given their careers, that is just what they will do.  So the nominations of these two men are exhibits A and B that President Trump plans to run his administration from the hard right, rather than follow through on his populist rhetoric that defined his campaign, and frankly is what elected him. If he had run on the campaign views of these two nominees, he might have gotten 100 electoral votes. He might have gotten 100 electoral votes.[[Page S1138]]  Second, on ethics. Again, this Cabinet is not only challenged on their views so far away from what the average American believes, but it is the most unethical Cabinet I have ever seen nominated, at least in my lifetime.  Representative Mulvaney is unfortunately an example of a Cabinet member that is too far compromised by potential conflicts of interest and other ethics challenges. It has been disclosed that Representative Mulvaney neglected to pay $15,000 in taxes on a household employee. A similar revelation sunk the nomination of a former Member and leader of this body, Senator Tom Senator Daschle was relentlessly attacked by the Republican side on this issue. He withdrew his nomination. Representative Mulvaney hasn't withdrawn his nomination, and we haven't heard a peep out of the Republican side on the same--very similar--transgression that was disqualifying, at least to our Republicans, for Senator Daschle, nor has the nominee for Secretary of Labor withdrawn his nomination. He has a similar situation.  The fact that the Republican majority is proceeding on both of their nominations is a dangerous abandonment of public ethics.

525,topic-id,918,"Mr.President, I rise this morning to address the events of General Flynn's resignation as National Security Advisor on Monday night and the need for a full, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the facts of the case. It is now readily apparent that General Flynn's resignation is not the end of the story. It is merely the beginning of a much longer story.  The circumstances of General Flynn's contacts with the Russian Ambassador during the transition, the recent reports of potential high-level contact between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, including General Flynn, should raise hairs on the necks of everyone in this body and every American of goodwill--Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal, This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue about our country and how it is governed. It is also an issue about our security. We are now left with more questions than answers, and it is imperative to find the truth. With every hour that goes by, more and more questions are raised. Every White House press briefing and early morning tweet seemingly introduces new inconsistencies and contradictions that demand a full accounting. Every report that suggests deeper ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian Government needs to be followed up on and verified.  We need to get all the facts.  So in the days and weeks ahead, the Trump administration needs to answer some serious questions. These questions must be asked by an independent and unbiased law enforcement authority. They must be answered truthfully by administration officials. Any attempt to lie or to mislead must be countered with the full force of law.  There needs to be an independent and transparent investigation on two fronts: one in the legislative branch, where we have an obligation to conduct oversight, and one in the executive branch, which has the responsibility of finding and prosecuting potential criminal liability.  Today I wish to address the investigation that must occur in the executive branch.  The new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, cannot be the person to lead that investigation. In fact, Justice Department regulations specifically prohibit individuals who have political ties to the subjects of an investigation from leading that investigation. It is a clear conflict of interest. I want to read the regulations of the Department of They are right here, and every American should see them because they are clear as can be.       No Department of Justice employee may participate in a      criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or      political relationship with any person or organization      substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of      the investigation or prosecution or who would be directly      affected by the outcome.[[Page S1167]]  No employee shall participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or the prosecution.  The regulations continue. They define political relationship, again, clear as a bell:       Political relationship means a close identification with an      elected official, candidate, political party or campaign      organization arising from service as a principal advisor or      official. Personal relationship means a close and substantial      connection of the type normally viewed as likely to induce      partiality.  Jeff Sessions was chairman of the National Security Advisory Committee alongside LTG Michael He was a senior adviser in the Trump campaign, the first Senator to endorse the President's campaign, and nominated him at the Republican Convention in Those facts and the Department of Justice's own rules disqualify Attorney General Sessions from running this investigation.  The words are crystal clear; there is no wiggle room. If Attorney General Sessions were to conduct or in any way be involved with this investigation, he would be violating Justice Department guidelines.  As bad a start as the Trump administration is off to, it would make things dramatically worse to ignore these guidelines, which were set up for the purpose of getting to the truth in a fair and impartial way.  Attorney General Sessions must recuse himself immediately. Any investigation headed by, directed by, or influenced by the Attorney General will be jaundiced from the very start.  Because the rules are so clear, I expect the Attorney General will recuse himself and allow an independent and thorough investigation to go forward.  We have an additional reason to seek an independent and transparent investigation because of how the White House has treated this matter over the past few weeks.  The White House knew for weeks that General Flynn misled the Vice President and let General Flynn stay on the job. They knew for weeks that his discussion about sanctions with the Russian Government could potentially compromise our national security because he would be subject to blackmail, and they let him stay on.  The President knew for weeks about this and let General Flynn stay on in his full capacity, present at and participating in the highest level of national security discussions, until those reports were made public.  If the reports of General Flynn's incorrect statements to the Vice President were never made public by the Washington Post, would the President's trust ever have eroded? Would General Flynn ever have been fired? Would he still be in his job today? We will never know now. The answer is very troubling.  If an investigation is not independent, nonpartisan, and, most of all, transparent, there is no guarantee this administration will take the decisive and immediate actions necessary to keep our country safe.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1166-3.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February
593,topic-id,544,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on the potential repeal of the Social Security Administration's rule that helps keep guns out of the hands of those with a severe mental illness. I voted no.  First, I want to point out that this rule only addresses a shortcoming in the existing background check law that Congress passed legislation to address. We use the National Instant Criminal Background Check system to prevent criminals and the adjudicated mentally ill from purchasing firearms.  In order for the FBI to have access to all the data they need to run those background checks, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Act in 2007--in bipartisan fashion, signed into law by President George Bush, hardly a gun safety activist--to instruct Federal agencies to send information to the NICS system about criminal records and mental illness.  This rule at the Social Security Administration is simply implementing that bipartisan law.  Second, let me underscore the point, this rule only applies to those who have severe mental health disorders, like schizophrenia. These are folks who, because of their disorder need assistance managing their own affairs and are so severely impaired that they cannot hold down a full-time job. It simply requires the Social Security Administration to pass that data on to the NICS background check system so the FBI can stop gun sales to the seriously mentally ill.  It doesn't get much more common sense than that.  Frankly, I find it absurd that the Republicans have chosen to repeal this rule as one of their first priorities in this  Does the Republican majority really think it is wise, as my colleague from Connecticut asked, that folks who are so severely mentally ill that they cannot work and require assistance managing their finances should be assumed to be able to responsibly own and protect a gun?  Mental illness is a serious topic. We have debated it many times in this body--how to better provide for treatment, how to decrease the stigma surrounding it--but I don't remember the part where we debated whether it was wise or not to allow folks with a severe, almost incapacitating, mental illness to easily purchase a gun.  Gun violence takes far too many lives each year. At the very, very least, we should be doing all that we can to prevent criminals, potential terrorists, and the adjudicated mentally ill from purchasing firearms; yet Republicans consistently line up behind the NRA to block or repeal policies that would do those things--even though 8 or 9 out of every 10 Americans supports them, though a vast majority of gunowners support them.  Whenever Republicans talk about gun violence, they say, ``Let's enforce the laws on the books!'' Well, as I mentioned, this regulation does just that; it implements the bipartisan 2007 NICS Improvement Act that Republican President George Bush signed into law.  Today, Republicans are calling their own bluff; they are not interested in enforcing the laws on the books--they just want to repeal them, even when that puts innocent American lives at risk.  If Republicans have a problem with this rule, they should have pushed the Social Security Administration to modify it, rather than repealing it outright and blocking any similar rulemaking on the subject, which is what this CRA would do.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1216-2.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February
929,topic-id,1591,"Mr.President, we are in a moment of profound unease about the stability of the executive branch of our government.  The recent reports about General Flynn detailing constant, high-level contact between members of the Trump administration and the Russian Government raise serious doubts about this administration's competence in the realm of foreign policy and national security and even graver doubts about the sanctity of our democratic process.  We do not know all the facts, and in the coming days and weeks, more information may well surface about these disturbing revelations, but we already know that something is rotten in the state of  I have been in Congress a long time, and I have never, ever seen anything like this. The institutions of government are being tested in a way they have not been tested in some time.  At this juncture, we would all do well to remember that democracy--the most benevolent, desirable, effective, and just form of government devised by man--is also one of the most fragile systems of government devised by man. It requires constant vigilance and strong democratic institutions to bolster one another.  At the time of the drafting of the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson expressed doubt that a government founded on such a document could long endure. Varying factions in our founding generation worried alternatively about the threats posed by mob rule and potential autocrats.  One of the things that the Framers of the Constitution most worried about was the threat of foreign intervention in our government, what they called foreign intrigue. Federalist 68, likely authored by a famous resident of my State, Alexander Hamilton, labeled the ``desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils'' as one of the ``most deadly adversaries of republican government.'' That fear is the origin of the emoluments clause, which safeguards against bribery of government officials by foreign powers.  It cannot be that officers at the highest echelons of our governmentowe favors to foreign capitals. But it may well be that a high-level member of President Trump's campaign and administration, General Flynn, violated the emoluments clause by accepting money from the Russian Government during a trip to Moscow in 2015. The reported contact between operatives in the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials is exactly the kind of intrigue that our Founders sought to prohibit.  I mention all of this because I believe the stakes to be very high. This is not a drill. Nothing less than our system of checks and balances, the rule of law, and our national security is at stake.  Our Nation does not face moments like this often. Frankly, the fact that foreign powers would have high influence in our government has not been on the front page for decades. But the wisdom of the Founding Fathers shines through. It is a real danger, and now the possibility of that danger being real is here today.  History will look upon us and will no doubt judge our efforts to stem this wrong wherever it occurs. Our Nation does not face moments like this often.  From the earliest days of the Republic, what has always sustained us has been the strength of our democratic institutions of government. We have distinct pillars of power that check and balance one another for the very purpose of fortifying our government whenever one branch is deficient. On this matter, the legislative branch has a responsibility to be that check and balance via our oversight duties.  All of us can agree that right now what are required are the facts. We have to evaluate the scope of Russia's interference in our election and assess if agents of their government have penetrated to the highest levels of our government. Throughout the process, we have to avoid jumping to conclusions or engaging in wild speculation. We must seek the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Once we have all the facts at our disposal, Democrats and Republicans alike can debate what to do next.  The investigation should proceed along two tracks. The first is My friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is committed to using every resource and authority in that committee to seek the truth. His committee will take the lead, but it will not be the only committee that looks into ties between the Trump campaign, transition, or administration, and The Judiciary, Foreign Relations, HSGAC, Banking, and Commerce Committees all have significant roles at getting to the bottom of this. They should also move forward in their areas of jurisdiction. These committee investigations must be bipartisan; they must have access to all intelligence officials, transcripts, documents, and other related materials that they need to answer critical questions; and they must be permitted to make their findings public to the maximum extent possible.  Of course, anything that Congress does requires Republican support because they are in the majority. I am gratified that some of our Republican colleagues have called for that. Bipartisan letters from the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee have been and are being sent last night and today. These letters will ask for document preservation, briefings, and for information related to the investigations.  As for the Intelligence Committee, Senator Burr, the chairman, originally expressed skepticism about his committee proceeding with an investigation into the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but he is now working well with Senator Warner to do this. We will be watching very carefully. If the Intelligence Committee investigation is not proceeding to unearth the entire truth, we will seek alternative tools and structures to get to the truth because get to the truth we must.  The second part of the investigation is in the executive branch, where law enforcement resides. While Congress has a constitutional oversight ability to bring facts to light, it is only the executive branch that can prosecute potential criminal liability.  The two are not mutually exclusive. They are not either/or. They must move forward simultaneously on parallel tracks.  On the executive branch side, three specific things must now happen:  First, Attorney General Sessions must follow Department of Justice guidance and recuse himself.  When the FBI looks into a matter, they do so right alongside prosecutors from the Justice Those prosecutors should not be reporting to the first Senator who endorsed Donald Trump's campaign, who served on the same campaign committee as General Flynn, and who nominated Donald Trump at the Republican convention. The Justice Department's own guidelines demand that Attorney General[[Page S1226]]Sessions remove himself from this matter immediately. If he does not, he will be breaking serious guidelines that have been in place for decades, followed by both Republican and Democratic administrations alike. To disregard or ignore these rules would be a major transgression by this administration, so early in its term, and would bode poorly for the future impartiality of the criminal justice system.  We now know that the President and the Attorney General are meeting today. Of course the President needs to meet with the Attorney General; that is important for national security. But until the Attorney General recuses himself, those meetings raise serious questions. There will be a cloud hanging over every meeting and conversation between the President and the Attorney General until the Attorney General recuses himself. We presume that they would not even think of discussing the investigation--that the Attorney General and the President would not--because if they were to discuss any investigation, it would constitute a massive, massive ethical violation.  Second, to reiterate, from the executive branch point of view, we expect the administration will order all records from administration, transition, and campaign officials to be preserved.  There is real concern that some in the administration may try to cover up its ties to Russia by deleting emails, texts, or other records that could shine a light on these connections. These records are likely to be the subject of executive branch as well as congressional investigations and must be preserved.  Third, campaign, transition, and administration officials must be made available to testify in public, under oath, on these issues.  It has been reported that campaign officials have had constant contact with Russian intelligence officials. They must testify.  Our caucus is united in these three requests, and we hope and expect our Republican colleagues to join in these appeals as well.  Senate Democrats are faithfully committed to keeping this issue above partisan politics. The gravity of this issue demands nothing less.  Throughout the history of this country, the Senate has come together to steer the ship of state through stormy seas when the times required it. Republican Senators like Howard Baker, Hugh Scott, and Bob Dole rose above politics during the Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Whitewater scandals to demand the truth. I am very hopeful my Republican colleagues on the other side will follow in that grand tradition. I am very hopeful the other side wants to get at all the facts, just as our side wants to get at all the facts.  I disagree with my friends on the other side of the aisle often on a number of issues--often, we disagree vociferously--but I have never once doubted their patriotism. This is an issue on which patriotism must prevail over politics because before we are Democrats or Republicans, we are Americans, with respect for the rule of law.

1162,topic-id,1340,"Madam President, I rise today on two topics--the need for Attorney General Sessions to recuse himself from the executive branch investigation into General Flynn and the nomination of Attorney General Pruitt to be the EPA  First, on the matter of executive branch investigations into General Flynn's contact with the Russian Ambassador, I rise again to stress my expectation that Attorney General Sessions will recuse himself from this investigation.  This morning we learned--according to reports in the Washington Post--that General Flynn may have lied--lied--to FBI investigators about the content of his phone call with the Russian Ambassador prior to the election. That is a potential felony offense, and it must be looked at and, if validated, potentially prosecuted by law enforcement officials at the Department of That review must be independent and thorough and completely by the books. In order for it to be so, the Attorney General must recuse himself pursuant to Department of Justice guidelines that prohibit members of the Department from participating in investigations of close political allies or friends.  The guidelines are crystal clear. I have read them on the floor before, but they are worth reading because there is no wiggle room here. It is absolutely clear:       No Department of Justice employee may participate in a      criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or      political relationship with any person or organization      substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of      the investigation or prosecution. . . . Political      relationship means a close identification with an elected      official, candidate, political party, or campaign      organization arising from service as a principal adviser or      official.  Those are the words of the DOJ guidelines. Those are not my words, but they are common sense. We don't want conflict of interest in our prosecutors. We don't want the appearance of a conflict in something as sacred as law enforcement here in  It is patently absurd to think that the Attorney General--a man who served alongside General Flynn on Candidate Trump's campaign council--is prepared to lead this investigation in an impartial way and in full compliance with those longstanding Department of Justice rules. There would be a complete appearance of a conflict and might, indeed, be a conflict itself. By the guidelines, it certainly is. There is no wiggle room here. AGs have recused themselves at least eight times over the past two decades to avoid the appearance of bias--twice under President Obama, five times under President Bush, and once under President  To conclude my remarks on this topic, I want to show--and I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed coauthored by then-Senator Sessions calling on Attorney General Loretta Lynch to recuse herself in the matter of Secretary Clinton's emails be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From FoxNews.com, 05, 2016]Giuliani, Sessions, Keating, et al.: Time for Loretta Lynch to Appoint                            a Special Counsel(Editor's note: The authors of the following column are all supporting                       Donald Trump for president)       We are concerned about the egregious damage that has been      inflicted on two revered government agencies: the Department      of Justice and Department of The primary missions of      both have been derailed for political purposes.       The Department of Justice has been thwarted by its top      officials' refusal to conduct a proper investigation of      former Secretary Clinton's unsecured email server and the Pay      for Play accusations based on millions of dollars paid to      President Clinton personally and the Clinton Foundation by      entities having issues before the State Department, all while      she was       Attorney General Lynch and former President Clinton met on      the Phoenix, Arizona tarmac days before Secretary Clinton was      to be interviewed by the FBI for possible criminal activity.      It has been reported that her staff ordered witnesses not to      take pictures and no one was present during their 39-minute      conversation. General Lynch never recused herself from      decisions on the Clinton[[Page S1383]]     investigation after her self-admitted ``mistake,'' as it has      also been reported that she continues to deny the FBI the      authority to convene a Grand Jury, which is necessary for any      meaningful investigation. Secretary Clinton's conduct at the Department of State corrupted our                              foreign policy       It has also been reported that General Lynch opposed      Director Comey from fulfilling his obligation to Congress by      informing members of the discovery of 650,000 emails on      Anthony Weiner's and Huma Abedin's computer, the existence of      which had been concealed from government authorities.       Recusal is a formal process. It is a written document      specifically describing the scope of the recusal and      designating the official in charge of the recused matter. If      General Lynch went through the proper procedure for recusal,      she has not publicly shared it.       Secretary Clinton's conduct at the Department of State      corrupted our foreign policy. She and President Clinton      turned the agency into a Pay for Play adjunct of the Clinton      Foundation and their personal bank account, the latter via      his personal ``speaking'' fees. [UBS, Switzerland's largest      bank, contributed over $600,000 to the Foundation and loaned      it over $30,000,000. UBS was grateful that Secretary Clinton      had intervened in the IRS' demand to UBS to provide      identities of 52,000 depositors. Secretary Clinton announced      the settlement of only 4,450 identities in an ``unusual      intervention by a top U.diplomat,'' according to the Wall      Street UBS additionally paid President Clinton      personally $1,500,000 for a series of questions and answers      with top management.       President Clinton reaped $6,200,000 personally from foreign      governments and businesses for speeches while she was      Secretary of For example, Ericsson, a Swedish      corporation, had sanction issues pending before the State      Department regarding telecom sales in certain countries.      Ericsson paid President Clinton $750,000 for one speech. Days      later the State Department announced the sanction list and      Ericsson was not affected. Why should any spouse of a      Secretary of State be permitted ever to receive one cent from      a foreign entity?       Because of our grave concern for integrity in government we      ask for a Special When a high public official is      accused of serious wrongdoing and there is a sufficient      factual predicate to investigate, it is imperative the      investigation be thorough, with dispatch and without      partisanship.       Secretary Clinton is the subject of two spheres of criminal      conduct: her deliberate, systematic mishandling of official      and classified emails and her abuse of a family-controlled,      tax-exempt Foundation, and corporate and foreign donations      for her own economic and political benefit.       These allegations arose well before this election year.       Clinton's mishandling of emails became public in March      2015, and allegations over abuse of the Foundation arose well      before that. There has long been sufficient factual predicate      to require these matters be fully investigated.       The appropriate response when the subject matter is public      and it arises in a highly-charged political atmosphere is for      the Attorney General to appoint a Special Counsel of great      public stature and indisputable independence to assure the      public the matter will be handled without partisanship.       In 1991-1992, a Special Counsel was appointed for three      separate matters: House Bank, Iraqgate, and It was      also done in 2003 in the Valerie Plame matter.       Instead of moving with dispatch to ensure a vigorous      investigation of Secretary Clinton, it appears that the      Justice Department, along with State, have enabled the      Clinton campaign to ``slow roll'' the inquiry.       General Lynch continues to exert control of a matter that      she should have assigned to another official.       We are distressed by widespread and credible reports that      FBI agents have been hindered by the Justice Department's      withholding of basic investigative tools, such as grand jury      subpoenas, which are fundamental in a complex investigation.       It is time to do what should have been done long ago--     appoint a Special       Rudolph Giuliani--Former Associate Attorney General and      U.Attorney in Southern District of New York       Senator Jeff Sessions--former U.Attorney for Alabama's      Southern District       Frank Keating--Former Associate Attorney General, U.in      District of Kansas and Special Agent FBI       Victoria Toensing--former Deputy Assistant Attorney General      in the Criminal Division of the U.Justice Department       Henry McMaster--former U.Attorney, District of South      Carolina       Rudy Giuliani is the former Mayor of the City of New  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,16.0,February
1163,topic-id,827,"Senator Sessions, right here, called for Loretta Lynch--then Attorney General--to recuse herself because of a conflict of interest under the very same guidelines we cited. We hope and we pray that Senator Sessions doesn't have an enormous double standard by refusing to recuse himself now when he asked the previous Attorney General to do so. We hope that President Trump will abide by the guidelines and encourage Senator Sessions to go by the guidelines and not again invoke any double standard.  This op-ed makes it crystal clear. What was good enough for Loretta Lynch, who did step aside, is good enough for Attorney General Sessions, and it would be outrageous--outrageous--for him to be in charge of this investigation.  The op-ed says: ``When a high public official is accused of serious wrongdoing and there is a sufficient factual predicate to investigate, it is imperative the investigation be thorough, without dispatch and without partisanship.''  So I hope Attorney General Sessions takes the word of Senator Jeff Sessions to heart. Every day that goes by without a recusal from the Attorney General, the cloud hanging over this investigation and over this administration gets darker and darker. And every time the President and Attorney General Sessions confer, again, the cloud hovers over them: What did they talk about? Was it this investigation?  So I hope Attorney General Sessions will do the right thing and recuse himself. Justice, the American way, and separation of powers require no less.  Madam President, today we will vote on another Cabinet nominee who is clouded by potential conflicts of interest and whose views are almost antithetical to the very purpose of the Agency to which he is nominated.  Mr.Pruitt is a climate science denier--some say skeptic, but this is not an issue where you can be skeptical; either you accept the overwhelming opinion of climate scientists and researchers or you don't.  Here is Scott Pruitt on climate change on Oklahoma talk radio:       Well, reasonable minds can disagree what is actually      happening, whether it is happening, number one, whether there      is change in climate that is occurring, that the trajectory      of it is something that is sustainable and whether that is      actually happening . . . the debate about climate change is      just that, a debate.  I would invite this nominee to walk through Long Beach or Long Island or Staten Island in New York City in the days and weeks after Superstorm Sandy rocked my None of those residents--the thousands who lost homes, the hundreds of thousands who suffered injury, damage, economic problems from the flood--they don't debate it, nor should he. There was no debate there. Folks lost everything that belonged to them. There was no debate about that. Forty-eight people in my State died--no debate about that.  Climate change will lead to more devastating natural disasters like Sandy, which was the third 100-year storm to strike my State in a decade. Climate change will make asthma and respiratory diseases worse. It is increasing the range of deer ticks that cause lyme disease--no debate about that. We have to do something about climate change.  Scott Pruitt as head of our Nation's Environmental Protection Agency likely wouldn't lift a finger. But it is part of a lifelong pattern. Instead of fighting for average Americans, Mr.Pruitt decided to make a name for himself among the far right by endlessly suing the EPA in ways that would benefit large special interests that also happen to be campaign contributors. In 13 of his 14 lawsuits against the EPA, he joined corporations and trade associations that had contributed to his campaign.  Just yesterday, an Oklahoma judge ruled that Scott Pruitt must turn over approximately 3,000 emails relating to his communications with the fossil fuel industry--the very industry he represented in these lawsuits. We won't get those emails until So you would expect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to be up in arms. Remember, emails? We should get them out, they said, about Hillary Clinton--the same group. In 2013, Gina McCarthy waited 122 days to be confirmed for EPA Administrator because she wasn't honoring a commitment, they felt, to transparency.  There were several inquiries into the emails of Lisa Jackson, another EPA But the majority and majority leader are proceeding right along and rushing Attorney General Pruitt through the process. We know why. They want you, my fellow Republicans, to vote for Mr.Pruitt before[[Page S1384]]those emails come to light. If they weren't worried about them, then why rush? It is not the worst thing in the world to take a few extra days to properly vet someone who will have immense power over our Nation's streams, skies, even the lead level in our homes and water supply.  Those emails could contain material information about his confirmation. But unless we move the confirmation back, the Senate will not get a chance to review those emails before voting on his nomination.  The PRESIDING The Senator's postcloture time has expired.

Tomorrow night, the President will give his first address to a joint session of I will have more to say later this afternoon at the National Press Club about the first month of the Trump administration and what we can expect from the speech. For now, I will just say that if past is prologue, the President will come to Congress with a populist message in an attempt to cloak what has been a hard-right, anti-working person administration.  His words are populist. He talks as though he favors the working men and women of America, but his actions are straight out of the hard-right playbook, which makes it easier for the special interests and puts greater burdens on the backs of the working class and the middle class.  Every American should be looking at what this President is doing, not saying, because, thus far, the two have been vastly different.                          Affordable Care Act  Now for the ACA, Mr.This past week, Republicans across the country in both Chambers were greeted in townhalls by angry constituents who waited in long lines and packed high school gyms, auditoriums, and community centers wall to wall to question their Republican representatives about their plan to repeal the Affordable Care  Americans are speaking loudly and clearly that their jobs, their hospitals--particularly rural hospitals--and their health care is on the line and want to know how Republicans plan to replace the law. On Friday, we saw the outline of the Republican plan. Like every single draft plan that Republicans have come up with, the outline we saw on Friday would raise costs and provide fewer benefits to average Americans and put the insurance companies back in the driver's seat. Average Americans under this Republican plan will get less, and they will pay more.  Today, President Trump is meeting with the insurance companies about this plan. What happened to the President we saw on the campaign trail railing against the special interests? It[[Page S1422]]turns out that the special interests are getting their way at the expense of working Americans--less coverage, higher premiums, fewer sick people insured.  My Republican friends listened to the outcry from their constituents: Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a threadbare health insurance plan that puts insurance companies back in charge. Keep the law and work with Democrats on reasonable fixes.                          Cabinet Nominations  Finally, Mr.President, I want to comment again on the The three nominees the Senate will consider this week are similar to the rest of the President's Cabinet in the number of conflicts of interest they possess, their lack of confidence and expertise, and their hard-right ideology. The Cabinet confirmation process has been like an assembly line of the least qualified and most conflicted nominees I have seen in my time in the  Just yesterday, the nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy withdrew his name from consideration because he couldn't disentangle himself from his massive personal business interests. He may have more integrity than some of the others who continued through the process with conflicts of interest hanging over their heads. The Secretary of the Navy nominee is 1 of 14 relatively high-level administration officials who have left, resigned or withdrawn their nomination in just the first month of this That list includes the nominee for Secretary of Labor, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and the principal National Security  It is clear the Trump administration did not properly vet or carefully select these picks.

1496,topic-id,337,"Madam President, I rise to echo the concerns expressed by my colleague from Florida, Bill Nelson, about the White House's refusal to provide written testimony relevant to Mr.Ross's nomination prior to the vote this evening.  Mr.Ross was a key economic adviser to the Trump campaign, and he has had business ties with the Bank of Cyprus, a bank with significant Russian investors. I understand that the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, of which my friend from Florida is the ranking member, sent a letter to Mr.Ross to get more information about those ties. That is a perfectly reasonable request, especially given the circumstances. This information is particularly relevant to the Senate since, in recent days, questions about connections between the Trump administration and Russia have proliferated.  While Mr.Ross told my friend from Florida that there is nothing to worry about, the White House is sitting on Mr.Ross's written response to Senator Nelson's letter. So the Senate will not get written answers to these important questions before voting on this nomination.  This is just another example of this administration's abandoning transparency and trying to jam nominees through without making all of the relevant information public and available.

Tonight's speech from the President will be far less important than past Presidential addresses for one very simple reason, this President has shown throughout his campaign for the Presidency and now his first month in office that there is a yawning gap between what he says and what his administration actually does for working  He talks like a populist but governs like a pro-corporate, pro-elite, hard-right ideologue. He promised to be a champion for working people in his inauguration, and then 1 hour later signed an Executive order making it harder for working people to afford a mortgage. He told raucous crowds that he would tear down the power structure in Washington and drain the swamp, but he has spent his first month in office appointing bankers and billionaires and titans of Wall Street to fill his administration. He ran a campaign against the elites, promising to stand up to Wall Street, but as soon as he was in office, he started to try to roll back Wall Street reform and consumer protections designed to prevent another economic crisis and protect the interests of hard-working  In his inauguration, he said that Washington and the special interests have enriched themselves while ``the people did not share in its wealth.'' Then, one of the first bills he signed made it easier for large oil, gas, and mining companies to hide payments--potentially bribes--they make to foreign governments.  That is the swamp. He is not cleaning it; he is making it worse. Despite all his talk, he seems to be full steam ahead on a program to help big business, the special interests, and Wall Meanwhile, a massive infrastructure proposal, a centerpiece of his pitch to working America, is nowhere to be found. A program to stop jobs from moving overseas--not just tweeting about a few hundred jobs at Carrier plants staying in the United States--is nowhere to be found.  President Trump ran as a populist and still talks like one, but his first month has been a boon for corporations, the wealthy, and the elite in America and has provided absolutely no relief to folks who are struggling to make ends meet--no relief to the middle class and those struggling to get there. In fact, many of his proposals shift the burden off the backs of the special interests and keep it on the backs of working families. He likely isn't finished yet.  Tonight, the President might discuss his tax plan. He said that every decision on taxes would be made to ``benefit American workers and American families.'' It is another grandiose promise. But every indication we have gotten about the administration's plan is that it would give tax breaks to the wealthy and shift the burden onto the middle class and working class.  So no matter what the President says tonight, we will have to look at the details of his proposal and see who it really helps, and every American should, as well.  Tonight, if past is prologue, the President will use populist rhetoric in his speech, but he won't back it up with real actions. He will use populist rhetoric in his speech to hide what he is actually doing, which is helping the special interests and making it harder to stay in the middle class. He talks like he favors working people, but his actions ultimately desert them.  He will present himself as a President for the forgotten man, but he will forget him the moment it comes to governing. So while I hope the President offers a message of inclusivity and talks about some issues where Democrats and Republicans can perhaps find common ground, his speech tonight will mean nothing the very instant after it is delivered unless he backs up his words with real actions.  His speech tonight will be nothing if his Cabinet of billionaires and bankers, his main advisers who seem to favor the wealthy, and an agenda far away from what America wants, continue to govern from the hard right, which is very far from the American mainstream and even the Republican mainstream. His speech tonight will mean nothing if he continues to do as he has done these first few months since being elected--breaking promises to working people and putting an even greater burden on their backs while making it easier to be wealthy and well-connected in  I yield the floor.

So I thank these two leaders for their tireless work.  When I was first elected to the Senate in 2008, one of the reasons I joined the Small Business Committee was its reputation as a place where you could work across the aisle to get things done in a bipartisan way because supporting small businesses is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it is an American issue.

572,topic-id,1679,"Mr.President, unfortunately I don't share the enthusiasm of my colleague from Arkansas for Mick Mulvaney to serve as the Director of the Office of Management and In fact, I have great concerns about this nominee's views on a whole range of issues.  Because those views are far outside the mainstream of this country, I intend to vote against his confirmation. First and foremost, I am concerned about Mick Mulvaney's repeated votes against raising the debt ceiling and his reckless willingness to shut down the government in order to advance his extreme views.  It is Representative Mulvaney's longstanding position that failure to raise the debt ceiling would not precipitate a crisis. He said: ``I have yet to meet someone who can articulate the negative consequences.'' Well, let me articulate the consequences in very simple terms. If we refuse to raise the debt ceiling, we would default on the national debt, destroy the credit worthiness of the U.Government, and trigger a global financial crisis.  As the Governor of New Hampshire, I worked very hard with our State treasurer and with the legislature, through some very challenging fiscal times, to maintain New Hampshire's State bond rating. We did that because we knew that lowering the State's bond rating would mean an increase in costs for businesses trying to borrow money, for the government trying to borrow money, for taxpayers because they would have to pay those increased costs, and it would have a ripple effect across the economy that would have a real impact on the people of New  Representative Mulvaney does not seem to appreciate what would happen if the Federal Government defaulted on our debt. He has argued that the Treasury Secretary could avoid such a crisis by prioritizing interest payments; in other words, paying foreign holders of U.debt but not Social Security beneficiaries or the men and women of our Armed Forces, but there is no legal authority to do this. It is impractical, and recent Treasury Secretaries have denounced the idea. We got a foretaste of the consequences of default in 2011, when Representative Mulvaney and others blocked legislation to raise the debt ceiling, a crisis that took nearly 3 months to resolve.  That manufactured crisis shook financial markets, caused a spike in interest rates on U.securities, and it lead Standard and Poor's to take away America's AAA credit rating, and it cost $18.9 billion. Who does Mick Mulvaney think paid those $18.9 billion? It was the people of this country. Representative Mulvaney has repeatedly threatened to shut down the Federal  He helped lead the charge in shutting down the government in October of 2013 in a failed and misguided attempt to repeal the Affordable Care In 2015, he threatened to shut down the government again in order to defund Planned Both of those programs are critically important to the people of New Nearly 1 out of 10 Granite Staters have health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Planned Parenthood provides accessible, affordable healthcare to women all across the State of New Hampshire, women who, in most cases, could not get their healthcare any other way.  As Senator Durbin pointed out earlier, 97 percent of the services provided by Planned Parenthood are services that have nothing to do with abortion; they have to do with access to mammograms, to cancer screenings, to STD testing, the whole range of healthcare services that women need.  Unfortunately, the 16-day shutdown in 2013 created havoc across the economy, leading to the loss of an estimated 120,000 jobs. Millions of small businesses faced significant disruptions, many employees were laid off, and some businesses could not make payroll. But Representative Mulvaney is unrepentant. He insists that the shutdown was worth it. Well, tell that to some of the businesses in New Hampshire that took a huge hit. His brand of government by temper tantrum is reckless, it is irresponsible, and it should not be rewarded with a nomination to be the chief budget officer for the country.  Representative Mulvaney's disdain for true fiscal conservatism and his unbalanced budget priorities should also give us pause. He supports budgets that would provide massive tax cuts for corporations, for those at the top, and he would pair those with deep budget cuts for the middle class and the most vulnerable people in our society, including seniors and people with disabilities.  Representative Mulvaney advocates for radical cuts to Social Security and to Medicare and He has promised to end Medicare as we know it, privatizing it and converting it to a voucher program that shifts costs to seniors.  He advocates raising the retirement age to 70 for Social Security and 67 for Imagine telling construction workers and others who perform heavy labor that they have to work until age 70 before they can retire with the security of a Social Security check.  He also advocates shifting costs to States by block-granting Essentially what block grants do is give the money to States and allow them to administer those dollars. As a former Governor, I think States can administer those dollars, but when you want to cut as much as $1 trillion from healthcare services, which is what Mick Mulvaney wants to do, then you can administer them as well as possible, but you are still not going to be able to make up to the seniors and to disabled Americans and others in nursing homes for the cuts that are going to come when you block-grant those dollars to  Unfortunately, that is not the end of his extreme budget ideas. He advocates taking a meat-ax to the whole range of programs that bolster the middle class, everything from cancer research, to Pell grants, to healthcare.  Representative Mulvaney has even questioned the appropriateness of Federal funding for scientific research. In a Facebook post questioning the scientific consensus linking the Zika virus to microcephaly, he wrote: ``What might be the best question: Do we really need government funded research at all?'' Think about that.  Senator Durbin was very eloquent in talking about the difference that research has made in ending polio and addressing so many other diseases, such as HIV, that have affected Americans and people across the world. Well, the President's choice--Mick Mulvaney--to draft his annual budget, to be the head of his budget office, openly doubts that the government should be involved in addressing public[[Page S1199]]health threats, such as So how deeply does he plan to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control, for the National Institutes of Health, for our National Laboratories, and for federally funded extramural research? We don't know the answer to that, but we can assume from his statements that it is going to be significant.  Federally funded R&D is critical not only to addressing threats to public health but also to developing new technologies that enhance our national security and protect the environment. These technologies are essential to growing our economy and maintaining America's global leadership in technology and biomedical sciences.  In New Hampshire, the most dynamic sector of our economy is high-tech manufacturing and innovation. For our economy to grow, we need to stay ahead of global competition. But that doesn't happen on its own; it requires sustained investment in basic research--often research that the private sector considers too risky to do on its own.  As ranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I have seen this vividly demonstrated by the very successful Small Business Innovation Research Program, or SBIR works by harnessing the creativity and ingenuity of America's small businesses to meet the R&D missions of our Federal agencies, while also supporting the growth of small, high-tech companies that create good jobs in local communities across this country.  One recent study found that every dollar awarded by the Air Force to SBIR firms generated $12 in economic growth. That growth happens because small businesses develop technologies and then commercialize those technologies, creating good jobs in each of our  Many of these technologies are developed for our Armed Forces to better protect the homeland. A great example of that, which I have seen firsthand, is a company based in Hanover, NH, called Creare is working with the Navy to develop an innovative clothes dryer that dramatically reduces the risk of fires on submarines, and that is just one example of why the SBIR Program is the envy of the world.  I want to quote Charles Wessner, who led the National Academy of Sciences study of the SBIR In describing that program, he said: ``The rest of the world thinks this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.''  Well, make no mistake, this successful program is in serious jeopardy if Representative Mulvaney puts Federal R&D investments on the chopping block.  It is truly shocking that the President has nominated a budget director who questions the value of Federal funding for R&We need to invest in science. We need to invest in our small businesses, which create two out of every three jobs in this economy.  The OMB Director is one of the most senior economic advisers to the President of the United States, with enormous influence on policy matters.  Representative Mulvaney has been a zealous advocate for radical cuts to Social Security, to Medicaid, to the whole range of programs that support the middle class in this country. In addition, his willful failure to pay required Federal taxes has raised serious concerns about his integrity, which we all know is essential for every Cabinet officer.  After careful study of his record, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to reject this nominee. Putting Mick Mulvaney in charge of OMB is not just letting the fox guard the hen house; it is giving him a gun to kill the chickens, a pot to boil those chickens in, and a knife to eviscerate them when they are done.  Let's give President Trump the opportunity to put forward a qualified candidate with mainstream views to protect the middle class and to honor this Nation's financial obligations.

966,topic-id,1996,"Mr.President, I came to the floor today to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection I thank my colleague from Delaware, whom I had the honor to serve with when we were both Governors, for his good work to point out why Scott Pruitt is the wrong person to head the Environmental Protection  The EPA was created by a Republican President in 1970, Richard I remember very clearly when he did that. Across subsequent decades, support for this Agency and for its important mission has been a strongly bipartisan endeavor. Our Nation has benefited from the service of dedicated, highly effective EPA Administrators from both parties, but I am deeply concerned that Scott Pruitt is a radical break from this bipartisan tradition.  After reviewing Mr.Pruitt's environmental record, I have to ask: Why was he nominated for this critically important position? He rejects the core missions of the Environmental Protection Agency at every turn. He has sued the EPA to block protections for clean air and clean water; he is an outspoken climate change denier; he seeks to dismantle the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which was put in place to address climate change; and he opposes other efforts to slow the warming of this planet. Time and again, he has put private interests and their profits ahead of public interests and public health.[[Page S1245]]  As attorney general of Oklahoma, he has sided with oil and gas companies, and he has failed to protect the people of his State from some of the worst impacts of hydraulic fracturing. He has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from fossil fuel industries, and he zealously advocated for their freedom to pollute our air and water.  So again I ask: Why was Scott Pruitt nominated to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency? Well, I think it is clear Mr.Pruitt was nominated not to lead the EPA forward but to prevent it from carrying out its mission. Make no mistake, Mr.Pruitt and his extreme agenda are a threat to the environment, to the planet, and to our public health.  Christine Todd Whitman, a former Republican Governor of New Jersey and whom I also had the honor of serving with when I was Governor--Senator Carper, Christie Whitman, and I all served as Governors together. She also was EPA Administrator during George Bush's administration. What she said about Pruitt I think is worth listening to. This is a Republican talking about Scott Pruitt: ``I don't recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the agency and the science behind what the agency does.''  People in the State of New Hampshire have no doubt about the reality of climate change. In the Granite State we see it. We experience it all the time. The steady increase in yearly temperatures and the rise in annual precipitation are already affecting New Hampshire's tourism and our outdoor recreation economy, which accounts for more than $4 billion a year and employs over 50,000 people. Each year, hundreds of thousands of sportsmen and wildlife watchers come to New Hampshire to enjoy our beautiful mountains, our lakes, our other natural resources, and our 18 miles of coastline, which we are very proud of. As I said, hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation contribute more than $4 billion to New Hampshire's economy each year, but much of this is now threatened by the warming of our planet. Rising temperatures are shortening our fall foliage season, they are negatively affecting our snow- and ice-related winter recreation activities, including skiing, snowboarding, and snowmobiling. An estimated 17,000 Granite Staters are directly employed by the ski industry in New Hampshire, and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services warns that those jobs are threatened by climate change.  Likewise, New Hampshire's and indeed all of New England's brilliant fall foliage is at risk. I wish to quote from a report by New Hampshire Citizens for Responsible Energy They say: ``Current modeling forecasts predict that maple sugar trees eventually will be completely eliminated as a regionally important species in the northeastern United States.''  Climate modeling by the Union of Concerned Scientists projects that by the end of this century, New Hampshire summers will feel like present-day summers in North Carolina, 700 miles to our south. We have a map that shows what is going to happen to our red maples and the maple sugaring industry. We can see everything here that is in red, these are all those sugar maples. It is projected that by 2070 or 2100, they are gone. They are gone from New England, from the Northeast, and from most of the Eastern part of this country. If we fail to act on climate change, this could mean a steep loss of jobs. It could mean a loss of revenue. It will destroy our maple sugaring industry and will damage our outdoor recreation industry.  Maple sugar production is entirely dependent on weather conditions, and changes--no matter how modest--can throw off production and endanger this industry. Maple trees require warm days and freezing nights to create the optimal sugar content in sap production. The changing climate is putting more and more stress on sugar maples. As this map shows so well, it is already significantly affecting syrup production. If we fail to act on climate change, this could destroy our maple syrup industry. If you haven't done maple sugaring in the springtime, there is nothing like maple syrup over snow. There is nothing else like it. To lose that and to lose the jobs that are there is a real change to one of the recreational activities we love in New  Climate change is also threatening our wildlife species and their habitats. The moose is an iconic feature of New Hampshire's culture and identity, but as the results of climate change, we have seen a 40-percent decline in New Hampshire's moose population. We can see clearly from these pictures why we are losing our moose: Because of milder winters, ticks don't die off. It is really very tragic. The ticks multiply on a moose, they ravage it, and they eventually kill it. I don't know if people can see, but what look like little balls on the end of that moose's tail are ticks. This moose probably has brain worm, which is another problem the moose have because of winters that aren't cold enough to kill off those parasites. Ticks multiply on a moose, they ravage it, and they eventually kill it.  We have seen modeling from the University of New Hampshire which suggests that by 2030, moose will be gone--not only from northern New Hampshire but from much of the northern part of this country.  Other newly invasive insects are harming wildlife species as well as trees. Of course, people are also suffering from the impacts of climate change. Rising temperatures increase the number of air pollution action days. They increase pollen and mold levels, outdoors as well as allergen levels inside, and all of these things are dangerous to sensitive populations with asthma, allergies, and chronic respiratory conditions. In fact, New Hampshire has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country because we are the tailpipe. All of New England is the tailpipe for the rest of the country. Pollution blows across this country from the Midwest and exits through New Hampshire and New  Rising temperatures facilitate the spread of insect-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease. We could see on that moose what the impact is. Those ticks aren't just multiplying on the moose, they are multiplying in a way that affects people as well.  Fortunately, because we have seen the impact of climate change, New Hampshire and the other New England States are taking the lead in reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a more energy-efficient, clean energy economy. We are one of nine Northeastern States participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative called It is essentially a cap-and-trade system in the New Hampshire has already reduced its power sector carbon pollution by 49 percent since 2008. That is a 49-percent reduction in less than a decade. Thanks to efforts by State and local communities, New Hampshire is on track to meet the Clean Power Plan's carbon reduction goals 10 years early. In addition, we are using proceeds from emissions permits sold at RGGI auctions to finance clean energy and energy efficiency investments.  Unfortunately, Scott Pruitt seems to believe that reducing pollution and investing in a clean environment are somehow bad for the economy. He is just wrong about that. Our efforts in New Hampshire and across New England to fight climate change and promote clean energy have been a major boost to economic growth. We have seen jobs added as a result. During its first 3 years, RGGI produced $1.6 billion in net economic value and created more than 16,000 jobs in our region. Nationwide, employment in the fossil fuel sector is falling dramatically, but job creation in the clean energy and energy efficiency sectors is exploding. According to the U.Department of Energy, more than 2 million jobs have been created in the energy efficiency sector alone and--if we can ever get Congress to move the energy efficiency legislation Senator Portman and I have introduced--would create, by 2030, another 200,000 jobs, just on energy efficiency. Across New England, we are demonstrating that smart energy choices can benefit the environment and strengthen job creation and the economy overall.  So, again, we have to ask: Why does Scott Pruitt deny the science of climate change? Why has he urged States to refuse to comply with the Clean Power Plan? Why has he filed lawsuit after lawsuit to block enforcement of the Clean Air Act? Why does he deny[[Page S1246]]something as nearly universally recognized as the dangers of mercury pollution?  The bottom line, I believe, is that Scott Pruitt is first and foremost a fierce defender of the oil and gas industry. If scientists point to carbon emissions as the main cause of climate change, then he has to deny that science. If science and common sense point to hydraulic fracking as the cause of thousands of earthquakes in the State of Oklahoma, then he must deny that too. If the EPA's mission is to protect clean air and clean water from pollution caused by fossil fuels, then he has to sue the EPA and try to cripple it.  Scott Pruitt's nomination is not about shaking things up in It is about turning over control of the EPA to the fossil fuel industry and turning back the clock on half a century of bipartisan efforts--in Democratic and Republican administrations alike--to protect clean air and clean water and to pass on to our children a livable environment and an Earth that they can inhabit from future generations.  My office has been flooded with calls, emails, and letters from Granite They not only oppose Mr.Pruitt's nomination, they are genuinely afraid of the consequences of putting him in charge of the  I heard from Deb Smith from Hampton, That is a small community on our coastline. She wrote:       I am a birder, love to walk on the beach and in the      mountains, and rely on time spent in nature to cope with a      [stage four] lung cancer diagnosis. Clean air is especially      important to me! Pruitt's long history of suing the EPA and      reversing decades of progress in improving the environment      disqualifies him for this post. It is essential to continue      to preserve and improve our natural environment for people,      birds, and other wildlife!  Elizabeth Garlo of Concord writes:       New Hampshire, due to quirks in its geology and the Earth's      rotation, is the ``tailpipe'' of the Nation with much of the      air pollutants from the Midwest exiting to the ocean from      here.

1404,topic-id,613,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend, Congressman LaHood, for having this tribute tonight.  Bob Michel was a giant here in Washington, and he left this world in a manner in which he probably would liked to have--without fanfare, without parades, just going home.  As was said, Bob Michel actually served in this House for 38 years. He loved the House of He cherished this Chamber and he cherished this institution. He served as minority leader for 14 years in, as he lovingly called it, the people's House, in this institution he dearly loved.  Few are left in this Chamber who actually served with him. It is my hope that Minority Whip Hoyer gets to the floor, who served with him. I think Steny also tries to represent that era of time when there were people who disagreed without being disagreeable or who could work across the aisle. I look forward to hearing Steny's remarks.  Bob was known for his aw-shucks demeanor and his baritone singing voice. I remember once at a Lincoln Day dinner, when he was leaving and I was running, and the people always wanted him to finish the Lincoln Day dinner singing ``God Bless America.'' Always.[[Page H1343]]It was mandatory. But his aw-shucks demeanor and his baritone voice should not distract from his keen legislative ability, where he steered the Reagan Revolution through this Chamber as the minority leader. As those of us who have served post-Bob Michel know, that is a difficult thing to do.  Many times you would see Bob Michel wearing his CIB on his lapel pin. For those of us who served in the military, the CIB is one of the most treasured awards because it means he was an infantryman who served in combat. My colleague, Congressman LaHood, relayed his service from Normandy to the Battle of the Bulge, meritorious service awards, and wounded in combat.  You can see Bob's presence here in the The Speaker's Office is named the Bob Michel Or go to Peoria--which I was fortunate to go to to attend the funeral--and you will drive across the Bob Michel The funeral service was on the campus of Bradley University, and the student union is named after Bob  Bob Michel loved baseball. As an avid player myself, we shared fond memories. I pitched, he pitched. I think he won more games than I did. One flaw in Bob Michel's character was being a Cubs fan. As a Cardinals fan, I was able to say that. But when all the ceremonies were going on with the Cubs winning the World Series, I finally found that a reason to be happy about the Cubs' success is that Bob was alive to experience it. In fact, stories over the weekend said he stayed up to see the final play and the final out. There is a great picture of him on his porch flying the                              {time}  2000  Bob was laid to rest in Peoria on I remember one of the statements made at the funeral, ``If Pekin is good enough for Senator Dirksen, then Peoria is good enough for me,'' and there he was laid to rest.

320,topic-id,877,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Before I start, I include in the Record a letter from over 20 healthcare provider organizations regarding the danger of cutting certain providers off from title X funding because they also provide abortion with private funds.                                                 February 3, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Charles Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Leader Schumer and      Leader Pelosi: As organizations representing health care and      public health professionals and the people they serve across      the country, we strongly oppose any effort to prevent Planned      Parenthood health centers from participating in federal      health programs, including Medicaid and the Title X family      planning program. Any proposal to exclude Planned Parenthood      from public health programs will severely curtail women's      access to essential health care services, including family      planning, well-woman exams, breast and cervical cancers      screenings, and HIV testing and counseling. At a time when      there is much uncertainty about the future of affordable      health care in our country, it is dangerous to cut off access      to the life-saving preventive care that Planned Parenthood      provides to some of our nation's most vulnerable patients.       Planned Parenthood health centers play a crucial role in      improving the health and lives of people across the country.      In fact, 2.5 million women, men and young people rely on      Planned Parenthood for health care every year. For many      women, Planned Parenthood is their only source of care--     offering basic preventive services that are fundamental to      women's health and well-being. More than 50% of Planned      Parenthood health centers are in areas with health      professional shortages, rural or medically underserved areas.      In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood health centers provided      nearly 400,000 cervical cancer screenings and more than      360,000 breast exams. Additionally, Planned Parenthood      provides contraceptive services for over 2 million patients      and more than 4 million tests and treatments for sexually      transmitted infections, including These services improve      women's health, prevent an estimated 579,000 unintended      pregnancies, and decrease infant mortality.       Policies that would exclude Planned Parenthood from public      health funding would hurt millions of patients and undermine      health care access in communities across the country.      Limiting access to Planned Parenthood's approximately 650      health care centers across the country would prevent patients      from having timely access to basic preventive health care      services. Approximately 60 percent of Planned Parenthood      patients access care through Medicaid and Title X, in      addition to those who rely on other essential programs,      including maternal and child health programs and Centers for      Disease and Prevention (CDC) breast and cervical cancer      screening programs. In some states, Planned Parenthood is the      only provider participating in Title X, and more than 50      percent of Planned Parenthood health centers are located in a      medically underserved or health professional shortage area.      Because federal law already requires health care providers to      demonstrate that no federal funds are used for abortion,      prohibitions on funding for preventive care at Planned      Parenthood health centers will only devastate access to these      life-saving services.       In addition to limiting patients access to health care,      defunding Planned Parenthood is not cost effective. The      Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that      approximately 390,000 women would lose access and up to      650,000 patients could face reduced access to preventive      health care within a year should Congress act to block all      Medicaid patients from receiving care at Planned Parenthood      health centers. The CBO also projects that excluding Planned      Parenthood health centers from receiving reimbursement      through the Medicaid program would result in a net cost to      taxpayers of $130 million over 10 years because of the      increase in unintended pregnancies without the contraceptive      care provided by Planned Other publicly funded      health centers would not be able to compensate for the loss      of affordable family planning and reproductive health care      services provided by Planned       Every day, we see the harmful impact that unequal access to      health care has on women and communities across the country,      and we therefore strongly support policies that improve      access to affordable, quality health care. Policies that      would deny Planned Parenthood public health funds only serve      to cut millions off from critical preventive care, and we      strongly oppose any effort to do so. We also recognize this      as part of a broader effort to undermine access to safe,      legal abortion and curtail access to other reproductive      health care by limiting the ability of abortion providers to      participate in public health programs.

321,topic-id,1003,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from myself and 161 other Members to Speaker Ryan opposing the Republican majority's efforts to undermine title X family planning programs and women's access to health care.                                Congress of the United States,                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House of Representatives, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan: We write to express our grave concern      for efforts to undermine Title X family planning. Despite      promises to focus on jobs and the economy, Republicans have      started the 115th Congress with a total assault on women's      choices, access to care, and economic security by:       Charging ahead to sabotage and dismantle the Affordable      Care Act (ACA) while making no promises to preserve vital      protections for women;       Providing little to no details on their plans to replace      ACA, while making a point to announce that their ACA repeal      package will block access to Planned Parenthood, a high-     quality, long-trusted provider of reproductive health      services;       Rushing to impose and dramatically expand the global gag      rule, harming women around the world; and       Advancing the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion      Insurance Full Disclosure Act (H.7) through the House,      effectively banning private insurance companies from covering      comprehensive reproductive health services.       Now, with their most recent effort to weaken the Title X      national family planning program through the Congressional      Review Act, Republicans have demonstrated that they will stop      at nothing to limit women's access to vital health care.      Sadly, this includes contraception and family planning      services that all women need.       For more than 40 years, Title X has served as a cornerstone      of safety-net care. As the only dedicated source of federal      funding for family planning, Title X allows a diverse network      of providers to deliver high-quality care to low-income,      uninsured, or underinsured individuals and to those seeking      confidential care. In 2014 alone, Title X-funded clinics      helped prevent approximately 904,000 unintended pregnancies,      326,000 abortions, and 439,000 unplanned births. In addition      to direct clinical care, Title X also supports critical      infrastructure needs for health centers, including new      medical equipment and staff training that are not      reimbursable under Medicaid and commercial insurance. This      infrastructure is vital to ensuring safe, quality care at      health centers which serve and provide basic health services      to high-need populations.       Throughout both Democratic and Republican administrations,      Title X has been interpreted to prohibit state actions that      block providers or classes of providers from participating in      a Title X project based on factors unrelated to a provider's      qualifications to perform the required services. The networks      include providers ranging from state, county, and local      health departments as well as hospitals, family planning      councils, Planned Parenthood affiliates, federally qualified      health centers and other private non-profit organizations. In      fact, in instances when states have passed laws to[[Page H1195]]     limit provider participation in Title X, federal courts have      consistently held that those state laws are contrary to, and      preempted by, federal law.       In response to a growing number of states targeting family      planning providers for exclusion from key federal health      programs, including Title X, the previous Administration      proposed the regulation ``Compliance with Title X      Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting      Subrecipients.'' The regulation, which was finalized in      December 2016, helps ensure patient access to family planning      services and supplies through qualified providers by      reiterating that ``no recipient making subawards for the      provision of services as part of its Title X project may      prohibit an entity from participating for reasons other than      its ability to provide Title X services. During the      rulemaking process, the Department of Health and Human      Services received more than 145,000 comments, the vast      majority of which supported the rule.       Women across the United States, and the men who support      them, have had enough. It is unconscionable that this common      sense clarification has become a political football for      members of Congress who want to limit women's access to      comprehensive reproductive health care. We urge you to stand      in support of women and oppose this assault on contraceptive      access and care.

322,topic-id,846,"Mr.Speaker, the majority is in the midst of an unprecedented and relentless assault on women's health--and many other regulations while we are at it--that are being overturned every day here.  Although it pledged to govern by prioritizing jobs and the economy, the majority is, instead, escalating its war on women with H.43, a dangerous continuation of its never-ending crusade against access to health care for women.  The majority started the 115th Congress by moving quickly to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, a law that finally barred insurance companies from treating women as being a preexisting condition. Without this law, women once again would pay a higher rate for coverage than men.  Think about that for a moment. If everybody doesn't know it, before this law, single women paid from 10 to 57 percent more than men for their health insurance in States that allowed gender rating. A lot of people don't understand this, but it costs American women nearly a billion dollars every year. But Republicans are rushing to repeal the Affordable Care Act without anything to take its place.  The majority has also advanced H.7, a sweeping bill that would go beyond even the Hyde amendment, a 40-year provision that has been around for four decades too long.  This legislation wouldn't just make this amendment permanent; it would also place unprecedented limits on women's access to reproductive health services even if they wanted to pay out of their own pockets to access constitutionally protected abortion services.  These moves by the majority, along with the President signing a dramatic expansion of the global gag rule immediately after taking office, have brought millions of people pouring into the streets in protest.  During the National Women's March, millions of people marched all across the country and even around the globe to defend women's rights. These marches were likely the largest day of protests in American history. More than half a million people took to the streets right here in the Nation's They were peaceful, without a single arrest reported anywhere in the country.  Far from respecting those rights, the majority is today considering a measure that marks an entirely new front in their war against women's rights. This is the most serious threat facing women so far in this Congress, and it is only  Programs supported by title X help provide lifesaving preventative healthcare services like contraception, cancer screening, and STD testing to the men and women who need them most.  It is outrageous that the majority today is trying to allow conservative State legislatures to pick and choose who can provide this essential care with Federal money. That is one of the worst things in the world. The luck of the draw of where you live will determine whether or not you have access that is entitled to all people from the Federal money. This would threaten health centers from coast to coast.  Mr.Speaker, we are facing the same problem today we faced for a very long time: men in blue suits and red ties determining what women can and should do when it comes to their own health. They believe the majority of persons--women--in the United States are incapable of making their own decisions.  Do you think that about your own mother or your wife?  Because Washington, D.C., is controlled by this Republican majority, the stakes for women are higher today than they have been in generations, as we turn over laws passed by the elected government of the District of  Mr.Speaker, Republican leaders in Congress turn a deaf ear to the majority of Americans who oppose this dramatic government intervention into women's health care. They, unfortunately, have the votes to pass it, but they will have to reckon with the overwhelming majority of the public who understands it is time for the government to get out of the business of taking away women's healthcare rights.  Mr.Speaker, let me take a personal moment to speak about the departure of a long-time member of my staff on the Rules I have always believed that this committee is like family and that we have one of the most respected staffs on Capitol Adam Berg, the deputy staff director and counsel on the Democratic staff personifies this.  After a decade of working for the Rules Committee, Adam is beginning a new chapter on a different committee in the House of His knowledge and guidance these last years have been immeasurable.  During his time here, he has married his wife, Erika, who is beautiful and talented, and became a father to his daughter, Ariel, who was singing songs with her mother at the age of 3 months. That is a precocious child.  Adam has played a key role as this committee brought landmark legislation to the floor of the House, including Dodd-Frank, the Affordable Care Act, and legislation to raise the Federal minimum wage.[[Page H1196]]  The committee wouldn't have been as effective without Adam's counsel, and he will be greatly missed. I wish him nothing but the best in his new endeavor.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1193-2.txt,1069,RECOGNIZING RARE DISEASE DAY,2017.0,15.0,February

The unprecedented marches and rallies that have been happening are necessary because of efforts like this to continually chip away at women's healthcare rights. The sad reality is that politicians have always worked to put up new roadblocks between women and their health care. It has always been my personal belief that when faced with a decision that needs to be made about a pregnancy, a woman should consult whomever she chooses--certainly her husband, her spiritual adviser, her medical adviser, but no one wants to wait in the room until a Congressperson gets there to make the final decision. We are going way beyond our depth to try to make that decision for persons. The government should not be in the business of doing that. The majority has made attacking women's constitutional rights the first order of business this year, working alongside our new President, and it is shameful.

133,topic-id,461,"Mr.Speaker, it is an honor to represent the people of Pennsylvania's 16th Congressional District and to serve the community in which I grew up.  I was very pleased a few months ago to come to Washington and join the new Member orientation. It was a great opportunity for all of us to meet our new colleagues on both sides of the aisle; and I must say, as has already been mentioned, I was impressed.  As we got to know one another and talk about our vision for this upcoming Congress, we all agreed we wanted to work together as much as possible. We decided we wanted to work to find common ground.  Today, across Pennsylvania and across America, finding common ground between Republicans and Democrats looks and sounds nearly impossible. We here in Congress may disagree on the issues, we may disagree on the solutions, but that is good. That is good because the purpose of this Chamber is to be a deliberative body. It is good because, collectively, we represent a wide range of issues across the political spectrum--we are supposed to--and, in fact, we are even expected to disagree, but we must always do so in a civil and respectful manner.  We must understand that, while we may disagree on the issues and solutions, we share, all of us, the common goal of serving our constituents and of improving their lives. We must understand that just because we may disagree with one another, that doesn't mean the other side is un-American or out to get us.  Arthur Brooks, President of the American Enterprise Institute, calls this ``political motive asymmetry.'' Brooks says: ``A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate.''  Now, I know I might disagree with some of my colleagues, but I can tell you, they are not motivated by hate. If we are to be successful in this Chamber and in discussions in our communities across the country, we must rid our discourse of this political motive asymmetry. Then we will be able, together, to find solutions more easily to the problems that we face.  I am hopeful that our freshman class, along with the rest of our colleagues on[[Page H1166]]both sides of the aisle, will be able to do what is stated in our commitment to civility: ``make the government work more efficiently and more effectively, help build consensus and restore public trust, and, ultimately, serve as a positive influence on society at large.''  We here in Congress are charged with an enormous task. In today's divisive and heated public discourse, we must be an example to our constituents by showing respect for one another at all times.

280,topic-id,740,"Mr.Speaker, we are in a constitutional crisis. Make no mistake about it. Yes, the National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned. Yes, he should have resigned, but he is just the tip of the iceberg. A glacier of Russian interference is plaguing our country right now.  In his resignation letter, General Flynn wrote: ``I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States.''  I believe General I believe he did precisely what the President of the United States asked him to do. General Flynn is a military man. He is accustomed to the chain of command. He did not do anything that he was not asked to do. He was not a rogue agent, but had the complete knowledge and cooperation of his Commander in  We have all heard Donald Trump boast of how smart he is and how he calls his own shots. Why then should we believe that, when it comes to national security, he prefers to be kept in the dark? A President can't be both in charge and out of the loop.  The only way we can ever hope to know what happened is if there is a thorough investigation. I believe it should be an independent investigation, an independent commission. But if we are going to go down the route of having it be a congressional investigation, then it needs to be a comprehensive investigation and one that has the resources to do the job.  I am calling on Chairman Nunes of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to schedule hearings immediately.  We heard 14 hours of testimony from Secretary Clinton about her emails. I think we can agree that foreign infiltration of our government at the highest level is at least as important as using a private email server, especially, I might add, when President Trump and his team used unencrypted cell phones during their North Korea strategy session at Mar-a-Lago in a dining room with many other guests.  Today, an Active Duty, four-star general said publicly that ``our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil'' and that he hopes ``they sort it out soon, because we're a nation at war.''  He continues: ``As a commander, I'm concerned our government be as stable as possible.''  It is critical that Congress takes heed of this unprecedented public warning and act.  I am well aware this is a partisan institution. I also know that there have been times in our proud history in the United States Congress when Members have pushed partisanship aside in search of the truth. The Warren Commission, following the assassination of President Kennedy, is one example. The 9/11 Commission after the terrorist attacks in 2001 is another.  In the Senate, at least three Republicans have directly called for investigations into this matter and several more have acknowledged that these questions must be answered. I wonder, will one House Republican Member come forward and say we must investigate?  Colleagues, I urge you to think this through. Vladimir Putin ordered agents to meddle in our election. Did he do it out of love for Mr.Trump? I doubt it. More likely, he did it so he could do to a democracy what we and our allies did to communism, send it to the ash heap of history. If America's elections can be hacked, what chance is there for budding democracies to make it?  Don't believe me? Look at what Putin has done in just 3 weeks of this new administration. He had government agents poisoned. He sent a political rival to prison. He sent $12 million to Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right candidate for the President of His latest move was to launch a cruise missile that is in direct defiance of treaties.  Putin's Russia is playing chicken with President Trump, and what is our President's response? A tweet complaining about leaks within his administration and, according to the latest reports, pressuring the Prime Minister of Japan to forge closer relations with                              {time}  1015  President Trump's ``bromance'' is dangerous. It undermines our democracy, and it is destabilizing the globe.  What does Putin have on President Trump? What does President Trump owe Putin?  We will not know until we exercise U.Code section 6103. A vote yesterday in Ways and Means was a totally partisan vote. We deserve to know what his tax return shows us. We deserve the truth.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1188-2.txt,1890,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE OF DEPARTMENT OF,2017.0,15.0,February

Madam Speaker, it is very hard for me to listen to the conversation on the other side of the aisle because it is a conversation they are having with themselves, and it is a conversation we are having with ourselves.  Let me be really clear. This is not about Planned Parenthood and abortion because we already know that Planned Parenthood gets no funding for abortions in this country, pure and simple. Planned Parenthood gets funding through title X to provide services for breast cancer screenings, cancer screenings, STDs, and contraception.  What my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to say is: We just want to make sure Planned Parenthood doesn't get a dime. Just squeeze every dime out of them that may be Federal dollars, even though they provide a really important health service.  So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I guess what you are saying is, to the 80,000 women last year who were diagnosed with cancer because they went to a Planned Parenthood facility and of the 800,000 that were screened for cancer, you would rather see them die.

The only thing clever about this bill is the title. Everything else about this bill is truly diabolical. The SCRUB Act isn't going to clean anything up. Its toxic suds will just make people sicker, our environment dirtier, and our products more dangerous.  Creating an unelected commission to oversee the entire regulatory policy of the United States is undemocratic and unimaginably damaging. Essentially, five people appointed by the President[[Page H1373]]would be able to sacrifice the health and safety of the American public to the altar of big business.                              {time}  1445  Say good-bye to protections from big banks, big polluters, and big pharmaceutical companies; and hello to financial ruin, environmental destruction, and unsafe food and drugs.

Also, the SCRUB Act's senseless and dangerous regulatory cut-go process would force agencies to choose between maintaining existing protections and responding to new threats to our health and safety. For example, in order to clean up the air, an agency might have to allow a corporation to pollute our drinking water.  Talk about death panels--this, my friends, is a death panel. The only thing the SCRUB Act washes away is commonsense governance. This is a diabolical bill; and this, my friends, is what being drunk with power delivers.

946,topic-id,1164,"Mr.President, let me say first that I join with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia in expressing concern about our water infrastructure and water issues. As many of us know, we have had terrific challenges in Flint, MI, with an entire water system being unable to be used because of lead poisoning and the terrible decisions made, primarily at the State level.  I was very concerned--when I speak about Mr.Pruitt and his nomination--that when asked by Senator Cardin if he believes there is any safe level of lead that can be taken into the human body, particularly a young person, he said that this is something he hasn't reviewed and doesn't know anything about. That is deeply concerning to me--that the person who would be heading the EPA would not know anything about lead poisoning and what that means, first of all, in a child's body, where it is poisoned and affects their development throughout their life. It is critically important for us in Michigan--and there are many, many places where there are serious water quality issues that need to be addressed--that we have someone who understands the science and the need for clean water rules and protecting our waters so that any family, any community can have the confidence of turning on the faucet and knowing that there is going to be clean water coming out into their sink in their home. It is very concerning to me that we have a nominee who indicated that he really didn't know anything about this issue.  So for that and a number of reasons--many, many reasons--I am joining with so many colleagues in opposing Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection  The EPA Administrator is a very important position. As I indicated, to those of us in Michigan, surrounded by the beauty of the Great Lakes, having the responsibility for protecting the Great Lakes, this is a very, very important position.  After examining Mr.Pruitt's record on a broad range of issues, as well as[[Page S1236]]his views about the Agency he has been nominated to lead, I have significant concerns about the direction and the priorities the EPA would take if he becomes  Now, this is not based on partisan politics. When George Bush was President, I joined 98 of my colleagues to vote to confirm Christie Todd Whitman to be EPA Two years later, I was among 87 other Members of the Senate to vote to confirm Michael Leavitt to succeed her at the  But the facts are--the evidence is--that Scott Pruitt does not have the requisite experience and track record to successfully lead an Agency that plays such a critical role in protecting the health and the well-being of the American people, and, certainly, the people that I represent in the great State of  As I mentioned before, we are very, very familiar with the importance of clean water and the consequences of environmental mismanagement. We need an EPA that will act quickly when there is a crisis like the one that happened in Flint, which is, unfortunately, still going on. This was a manmade crisis inflicted by the State of Michigan's actions on a number of different levels that created a situation where the State would rather save $100 a day than treat the water for lead corrosion. So $100 a day they wanted to save rather than treat the water to prevent children and families from being exposed to lead-tainted water. This was a State decision.  Mr.Pruitt has made it clear that it is his intention to defer as much as possible to States--to States like Michigan, which didn't treat the water, then didn't tell the truth, then covered it up, and still has not done--despite Congress and the President together acting to support that community, the State still has not stepped up to meet their responsibilities. After more than 2 years, people still cannot turn on the faucet and have confidence that they are going to have clean water. Yet Mr.Pruitt says the State ought to be the one making these decisions.  While I firmly believe an effective EPA is one that works closely and often in concert with State and local communities, we must also be sure we have leadership at the EPA that is willing and capable of providing the oversight necessary to ensure environmental and public health standards.  We also need an EPA Administrator whom we can trust to protect and preserve our amazing Great Critical to this objective is a grant program administered by the EPA called Great Lakes Restoration I was very pleased to champion and help launch this in 2010 with strong support from the Obama administration. This accelerates efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes by providing grants to clean up contaminated areas; prevent and control invasive species, things like Asian carp, which we are constantly having to focus on to push back these fish from destroying our fisheries and boating operations and environments in the Great Lakes; to address harmful algae blooms and restore habitat; and to protect native species.  Scott Pruitt's long record of opposing nearly all Federal environmental programs raises serious questions to me about his commitment to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and all of the efforts we have worked on in a bipartisan, bicameral way to make sure we are protecting 20 percent of the world's freshwater, 30 million people's drinking water, and a huge economic engine called the Great  I always like to say the Great Lakes are in our DNA, and that is very true for all of us who live in Michigan and certainly around the Great Lakes because we understand that this great natural resource supports more than 1.5 million jobs and nearly $62 billion in wages tied to jobs and industries, and, frankly, it reflects our wonderful quality of life in  I also have great concerns about Mr.Pruitt's long-running opposition to the landmark renewable fuel standard, which puts him at odds with the Agency that administers the program. The President promised us a farmer-friendly Yet this nominee to lead the Agency wants to dismantle one of the most successful economic drivers in rural Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly spoken out against the renewable fuel standard, calling the program flawed and unworkable.  Mr.Pruitt heading up EPA, coupled with former ExxonMobil executive Rex Tillerson at the State Department and oil refinery owner Carl Icahn advising the White House, may well be the end of the RFS as we know it. That is, frankly, bad news for biofuels producers in Michigan, bad news for Americans who care about creating economic growth and jobs in rural communities, and bad news for small towns and communities throughout Mr.Pruitt's record of siding with polluters over sound science puts him outside the mainstream of what we should expect from our EPA  It is for these reasons that I intend to vote against his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

578,topic-id,1207,"Mr.President, in the past month, I have come to the floor to recognize Alaskans who have generously devoted their time and talents to our State and made it a better place for all of us to live in. It is a great place to live. There is a mystique surrounding my great State--a well-earned mystique. People travel to Alaska from all over the world to discover a part of themselves that craves high peaks, beautiful mountains, streams, and swaths of wilderness.  The real wonders of Alaska are our people--kind and generous people, many of whom have etched warm homes and welcoming communities out of wilderness. One of those people who has helped make my State truly extraordinary is Mona Painter, our Alaskan of the  Mona, who will be 80 years old soon, first visited Alaska when she was just 11 in 1949. She flew, by herself, with others in a tiny four-engine passenger plane to visit relatives. In the 1950s, she moved to Alaska for good and eventually settled in Cooper Cooper Landing has about 350 year-round residents, but that number swells in the summer. It has some of the best fishing and rafting anywhere in the world--an astonishingly beautiful place.  It has people like Mona, a devoted wife, grandmother, great-grandmother, and someone, who according to one fellow resident, is ``the glue that binds the community of Cooper Landing together.''  She has done so much for this community--volunteering countless hours over the decades to ensure community cohesion in the schools, churches, and various clubs, including the Cooper Landing Community Hall, which serves as the community's unofficial city council.  Since living in Cooper Landing, Mona received an art degree, has taken anthropology classes, and even took a taxidermy class--once practicing her skills on a moose left on the side of the highway.  One of Mona's passions throughout the years has been to keep history alive in Cooper To that end, she started the Cooper Landing Historical Society and Museum, with which she is still very involved. For years she has devoted her time and energy to collecting bits of history about Cooper Landing and sharing that history with her neighbors, with residents, and with all She is also the founding member of the Kenai Communities Association and helped to spearhead the effort to create a national heritage area in that part of our  One of her friends said about her: ``The whole essence of her life has been to make this community a better place to live and to restore the history of the community.''

She has also raised two fine sons, Blake and Graham, and will soon be a doting grandmother.  DeLynn has accepted a job as the scheduling coordinator for our new Secretary of I am sad and happy for that. She will be leaving my office. She will be leaving a big hole in my office.

Thank you, DeLynn, for your years of service to You will always, always have a home with us.  Mr.President, I rise in support of Congressman Mulvaney's confirmation to be OMB Director for many of the reasons that a number of my colleagues have come to the floor and mentioned. The Presiding Officer just talked about some of those reasons. My colleague and friend from Wisconsin did a few minutes ago, also. Those are two issues that don't get talked about enough here and, certainly, weren't talked about enough in the last 8 years; that is, economic growth and the overregulation of our economy.  Again, it wasn't talked about a lot, but we had a lost decade of economic growth. The end of the Bush years and the entire Obama years never hit 3 percent GDP growth in 1 year--never. That is the first President in the history of the country not to do that.  For thousands, millions of Americans the American dream was starting to disappear because nobody focused on the issue of growth. I think in November the American people voted and said: We are not going to give up on the American dream. We want growth. We want opportunity. Why did we have that lost decade of growth where the economy grew at an anemic 1.5-percent GDP growth each quarter?  I think this chart shows a lot of the reasons right here--the explosion of Federal regulations that have literally choked opportunity and economic growth in our country. Year after year--Democrat or Republican--this is[[Page S1206]]what we see. This regulatory overreach impacts all kinds of Americans, mostly small businesses. This is a big reason why this economy has been stuck in first gear.  When I had my discussions with Congressman Mulvaney, we focused on this issue of growth, and we focused on this issue of overregulation. We haven't had an OMB Director in years who is focused like a laser on growth, like a laser on making sure we don't overburden our economy the way the Federal Government has done for decades. That is exactly what we need right now. We need growth. We need opportunity for We need the Federal Government to be a partner in opportunity, not an obstacle, as it is in so many  For these reasons and because I believe the next OMB Director is going to be focused on these issues--opportunity for Americans and growth for our economy, which sorely needs it--I plan on voting for the confirmation of Congressman Mulvaney, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,2290,DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,2017.0,15.0,February
1146,topic-id,3099,"Madam President, I rise in support of Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and I think it is important, as we are continuing this debate, to make a couple of things perfectly clear.  We all, like the Senator from Delaware who has been leading the debate, believe in clean water, clean air, how important that is to all Americans, certainly important to my State, which has some of the cleanest water, cleanest air, the most pristine environment in the world. I certainly don't think any of us debate that. We all agree on properly disposing of waste and cleaning up contaminated sites. And just this past year, Congress passed very dramatic legislation, very important--bipartisan, by the way; I am on the Environment and Public Works Committee--the Toxic Substances Control Act, TSCA, which does that. And I think most of us agree that the EPA has an important role in ensuring that we have clean water--within the authority granted to that Agency by So I think the vast majority of this body agrees with that.  But as I have been listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and their criticism of Attorney General[[Page S1376]]Scott Pruitt, one thing that has not come up over the past 24 hours in this debate--as a matter of fact, on the EPW Committee, on which I sit, the past 2 years, I don't think I heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle ever talk about this issue, and it is a very important issue for the country. It is the rule of law and the U. We have been debating Scott Pruitt's nomination for a while now, but not one of my colleagues has uttered that phrase--not one--even though many of my colleagues are lawyers and former law professors and former attorneys general themselves.  Why is this important? Why is it important to have a debate on the rule of law when we are looking at Scott Pruitt's nomination?  Well, I think it is incredibly important because if you looked at the EPA's actions and activities and focus over the last 8 years--the last 8 years--it has not been an Agency that has focused on the rule of law. In many ways it has been a lawless Agency, a rogue So when we are having this debate, we need to put the debate of Scott Pruitt's nomination and confirmation in the context of what has happened over the last 8 years.  We have had an Agency in the EPA that does not listen to States, even though it is required to by Federal law; that ignores the rule of law, as evidenced by numerous Federal court decisions rebuking it; and that believes it has the power to regulate every nook and cranny of American life--every economic activity of That is literally what we have right now with regard to our current This is not just one Senator making this claim. It has become the conventional wisdom and the common narrative with regard to this EPA in the last 8 years by a variety of Federal courts and law professors throughout the country.  Let me provide a few examples. A number of my colleagues have talked about the waters of the United States rule, WOTUS, and how this aggressive, far-reaching rule claims authority--the EPA claims authority to regulate literally puddles and irrigation ditches throughout the country, an enormous power grab.  A number of us were concerned about this. In hearings and in letters, I asked the previous EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, where she got the legal authority to do this. It was a pretty big deal. It took months to get an answer. States, under the law, are supposed to be consulted on this issue. States like my State, the great State of Alaska, were not consulted. They were ignored.  So what happened? What happened? Thirty-two States--bipartisan by the way, including Alaska--sued the EPA over this law, over this regulation, the waters of the United This is a critical point. ``Cooperative federalism,'' another term I have heard very little of in this debate, is the bedrock of environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air The principle establishes that the States and the EPA are partners. Indeed, under these Federal laws, the States are the primary protectors and implementers of our environmental protection laws.  That is in the law. That is in the Federal law. But for the past 8 years, the EPA has consistently ignored this on major rules. The most dramatic is right here, the waters of the United Thirty-two States sued to stop the EPA on this regulation. What happened in the lawsuit? The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals put a stay on the entire rule, expressing serious doubts about its legality. That is one instance and a big deal.  Let's look at another one, the so-called Clean Power I know the Presiding Officer has talked this, about how it is very concerning for her State of West Whatever your views are on climate change and the appropriate response, there should no debate in this body that we have to address this issue in a way that is consistent with the U.Constitution and rule of law--no debate.  Again, I never hear anyone talk about the rule of law on the other side. So this rule is promulgated. Once again, the Environmental Protection Agency, in the promulgation of this rule, took actions that the court and commentators across the political spectrum viewed as likely another illegal rule by the  So, like the waters of the United States rule, numerous States and others sued to stop the Clean Power Plan, in which the Environmental Protection Agency claimed somehow they had the authority to regulate almost the entire U.energy sector. Look at the rule. That is what they are claiming, that Congress somehow gave them that power.  In a previous Supreme Court case called Utility Air Regulatory Group, which was a lawsuit against the EPA--at the time I was serving as attorney general for the State of Alaska and was one of the AGs who initiated this suit--the EPA lost that one, and the Supreme Court and Justice Scalia, in writing the majority opinion stated:       When an agency, the EPA, claims to discover in a long      extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant      portion of the American economy, we typically greet its      announcement with a measure of skepticism. We expect Congress      to speak clearly if it wishes to assign an agency decisions      of vast economic and political significance.  In other words: EPA, you didn't have the power to regulate a huge swath of the American economy. The Supreme Court struck that down--Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency--so it was not surprising that with regard to the Clean Power Plan regulation, the Supreme Court of the United States put a stay on that rule. The Supreme Court of the United States put a stay on that rule before any other court, any other lower court, a district court, a court of appeals, had heard the arguments on that rule. Think about that. Do you know how many times the U.history that has happened? Do you know how many times in the history of the U.Supreme Court that has happened? Never before. It was the first time in the history of the Supreme Court that it saw a rule that it probably felt was so egregious that it put a stay on it before any other court ruled on that rule. It was pretty dramatic, pretty remarkable.  Clearly, the U.Supreme Court has serious doubts about whether the EPA is acting in a lawful manner on the Clean Power If you think it is just conservative jurists and lawyers and Senators who hold that view, you would be mistaken. Here is what Laurence Tribe said about the EPA's authority with regard to the Clean Power  For those of you who don't know Laurence Tribe, he is a very well-respected constitutional law professor at Harvard but very liberal. He was President Obama's law professor, but he is well-respected. Here is what he said about the EPA's authority on this very important regulation. He wrote in challenging the Clean Power Plan:       Even more fundamentally, the EPA, like every administrative      agency is constitutionally forbidden to exercise powers      Congress never delegated to it in the first place. The brute      fact is that the Obama administration failed to get climate      legislation through Yet the EPA is acting as though      it has the legislative authority anyway to re-engineer the      nation's electrical generating system and power grid. It does      not have this power.  That is Laurence He later testified in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2015 with regard to this regulation:       The EPA is attempting to exercise lawmaking power that      belongs to Congress and the judicial power that belongs to      the Federal courts. Burning the Constitution should not be      part of our national energy policy. EPA is attempting an      unconstitutional trifecta: usurping the prerogatives of the      States, Congress and the Federal courts all at once.  That is Laurence That is Harvard professor Laurence Tribe, who believes EPA is clearly acting in an unconstitutional manner.  It is not just losing in court and in the realm of both conservative and liberal leagues of public opinion; it has been the way that the EPA leadership, from the top to its foot soldiers, has treated the American people over the last 8 years--the American people whom the Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to serve.  That treatment can be described in many ways as with disdain. Let me provide a few examples of that. On the eve of another Supreme Court case, which the EPA lost--this is EPA v. Michigan--EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was asked on a TV show, Did she think she was going to win the case?  She responded as you would think most Administrators would. She said[[Page S1377]]yes, she was going to win. That is fine. She probably believed it and had good lawyers telling her that. But then she went on to say this:       But even if we don't [win], it was 3 years ago. Most of      [the companies] are already in compliance, investments have      been made, and we'll catch up.  Think about that quote. This is the head of the EPA, essentially saying: Even if we lose, we win. We are the Federal We don't have to abide by the law. Those companies and American citizens who are abiding by the law, who are abiding by the regulations, they have already made investments--hundreds of millions. They are stuck. We win. Heads we win, tails we win. That is a remarkable statement by the leader of a Federal Agency who shows disdain for the law.  Let me give you another example. My colleague and good friend from Colorado came down and talked about the Animas River and what happened there. Clearly it was a mistake. I don't believe that the EPA meant to do that, to spill millions of gallons of toxic waste into a river. But in a hearing in the EPW Committee, I asked the Administrator: Well, are you going to hold the EPA officials who did that to the same standard you would the private sector? In the private sector, in similar kinds of activities, the EPA has actually criminally charged people for doing something like that--negligence--criminally charged them.  She looked at me and said: Senator, not only are we going to hold ourselves to that standard, we are going to hold ourselves to a higher standard.  That is a pretty good answer.  So what has happened on the Animas River, with the EPA holding themselves to a higher standard? Remember, they put people in jail for doing this. Was anyone held responsible? Was anyone criminally charged? Did anyone go to jail?  Of course not. Nothing happened.  In my State, the EPA's disdain for my constituents has manifested itself in a couple of remarkable ways. First, we had the Administrator, former Administrator Gina McCarthy, in Alaska visiting after she came into office.  There was a big Wall Street Journal article on her visit. She was given some gifts by Alaskans, my constituents, the people she serves. When she was given gifts from my constituents on her visit to my State, she was later asked by a reporter what she did with them according to the government ethics rules.  Here is a quote from that story:       [Gina McCarthy] has been surprised by the government ethics      bureaucracy and its gift guidelines. Remarking how officials      chased her down for a dinky North Pole--  That is a community in Alaska--       pin someone gave her at an event as a gift (``I threw the      f-ing thing away,'' she told them).  With regard to another gift she got, a jar of moose meat from a young girl at a hearing in Alaska, she said that gift ``could gag a maggot.''  This was the leader of an Agency serving the people, and yet she was doing it in a way that is clearly disrespectful.  Let me talk about another incident in Alaska, in a place called Chicken, AK, where we have plaster miners out mining--small mining operations, family businesses, mining for gold.  The EPA thought there was going to be some Clean Water Act violations, which they never found. So what did they do? They didn't talk to the local community. They did a raid--body armor, assault weapons--on my constituents, a raid, a military assault to find clean water violations, which they never found, and they never apologized for the raid.  Now, you might ask: What does all this have to do with the nomination of Attorney General Pruitt? My answer is: Everything; everything.  He understands that the EPA needs a serious course correction, that it must get back to listening to the States and following the rule of law and, most importantly, regaining the trust of the American people, which has been lost over the last 8 years due to some of the actions I just described.  The American people see this. They see statements like this, and they know this has been an Agency that has not been acting in their interests and has not been acting according to the law.  Not only does Attorney General Pruitt understand this, he emphasized this during his confirmation hearing--6 hours long, which I sat through the entire thing.  Let me conclude by reading a few excerpts of his opening statement. The American people need to hear this because this is what Attorney General Pruitt is going to do when he leads the He said his priorities were:  First, under our Constitution, the role the EPA plays in protecting the environment is defined by statute, just as statutes limit every Federal  Members of this body--the Senate--and the House of Representatives have worked tirelessly over decades to set the balance in environmental policies through laws that have been passed. The EPA's role is to administer those laws faithfully.  As attorney general of Oklahoma, he stated: I saw examples where the Agency became dissatisfied with the tools Congress had given it to address certain issues and bootstrapped its own powers and tools through rulemaking. This, unfortunately, has only resulted in protracted litigation, where the courts suspended most of these rules after years of delay.  In the meantime, we lost the opportunity for true environmental protection as a nation. This approach is not right. So getting back to the rule of law, that is 1 for Attorney General  Second, he said:       Cooperative federalism must be respected and applied by the      EPA with regard to our environmental laws. Congress has      wisely and appropriately directed the EPA through our      environmental statutes to utilize the expertise and resources      of the States to better protect the environment, and for the      States to remain our nation's frontline environmental      implementers and enforcers. If we truly want to advance and      achieve cleaner air and water the States must be partners and      not mere passive instruments of federal will. If confirmed, I      will utilize the relationships I have forged with my      counterparts in the States to ensure that EPA returns to its      proper role, rather than using a heavy hand to coerce the      States into effectuating EPA policies.  Cooperative federalism--that is in the law, and he wants to uphold it.  Third, and finally, he said:       It is critical to me that EPA also truly listen to the      diverse views of the American people, and learn from them. If      confirmed as Administrator, I am committed to ensuring EPA's      decisions are conducted through open processes that take into      account the full range of views of the American people,      including the economic consequences of any regulation.       Environmental regulations should not occur in an economic      vacuum. We can simultaneously pursue the mutual goals of      environmental protection and economic growth. But that can      only happen if EPA listens--listens to the views of all      interested stakeholders, including the States, so that it can      determine how to realize its mission while considering the      pragmatic impacts of its decisions on jobs, communities, and      most importantly, families.  Finally, in the closing of his opening statement, Attorney General Pruitt said this:       My time as Attorney General of Oklahoma afforded me the      opportunity to travel my state meeting farmers, ranchers,      landowners, and small business owners of all sorts. These are      good people--hardworking Americans who want to do the right      thing by the environment. They want the air that their      children breathe and the waters in which they swim to be      clean. They want to follow the law. But recently they have      felt hopeless, subject to a never ending torrent of new      regulations that only a lawyer can understand. They fear the      EPA, and that just shouldn't be the case. If confirmed, I      will work tirelessly to ensure that the EPA acts lawfully,      sensibly, and with those hardworking Americans ever in mind.  That is how he ended his testimony.  Scott Pruitt is the right person to lead the We have gotten to the point, as he noted in his testimony, where millions of Americans, including some of my constituents in Chicken, AK, certainly have come to fear their own Federal Government, especially when it acts in a lawless fashion.

He hails from Montana, which has a similar view of how important the land is.

We can responsibly develop our resources and protect the environment. No country has a better record of doing that than the United States of  Congressman Zinke has committed to working with Alaska as a partner in opportunity, rather than acting as a roadblock to success. Why is this so important? This would be an enormously welcome change from the past administration. I served as Alaska's attorney general, as commissioner of natural resources in my great State, and now as a U.Senator, and I witnessed, unfortunately, how the former Obama administration tried to stop, stymie, and slow roll literally every economic project in Alaska--every one.  Alaska and so many States across our country have tremendous resources to be developed right now. America is undergoing an energy renaissance. We are once again the world's energy superpower, yet our Federal Government was not helpful in that renaissance at all. It can be now, and we are looking toward a bright future when we have a Federal Government that is going to be a partner in opportunity, not an obstacle. I am hopeful that we are going to see a new renaissance of economic growth and job creation in Alaska and across the country, buoyed by Federal agencies like the Department of the Interior under Congressman Zinke's leadership that want to help us seize opportunities, not undermine them.

126,topic-id,293,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the freshman class's effort to encourage civility in this Chamber and in our political discourse generally.  Americans are divided. Hate speech and hate crimes are spiking. Fake news is increasing. Terrorism threatens the world, and 60 million refugees are displaced across the globe.  The public is convinced that elected officials don't seem to get much done regarding the shrinking middle class, immigration reform, climate change, gun violence, and a whole bunch more. What should we do?  Love thy neighbor: That may seem like a simplistic public policy prescription, but love thy neighbor is a concept that can be found across many traditions.  If we are going to get Republicans and Democrats to actually come together as people of goodwill in search of the common good, it is going to require us to rely on some shared principles.  Faith and religious beliefs are the most effective, existing sources of commonality that may be relied upon. If people of different political philosophies actually believed that their opponents were similarly motivated by a common set of values to love thy neighbor, I believe we would get a lot more talking and problem-solving and, yes, less yelling and screaming.  Even nonreligious Americans have a fundamental belief in the religion-based concept of love thy neighbor. Discussing issues civilly and rooted in shared faith and values will result in more good work being accomplished.  The good news is that, during the first 6 weeks, I found that many of my colleagues seemed genuinely inspired by their faith and their values. Maybe if we all agree to be civil and recognize that many of us here are motivated by the same command to love thy neighbor, we might be a little more effective.

It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.'' President George Bush spoke these words at his first inaugural address in 2001. It was a time for new beginnings then, and it is a time for new beginnings now.  I cannot think of a more well-intentioned way to begin the 115th Congress than to join my awesome freshman class, from both sides, in committing to work together civilly to unify and further strengthen our great Through this commitment, we promise to put people before politics, to thoughtfully advocate for the needs of our communities, and to renew confidence and trust in our political system. Although we may disagree on a number of issues, this commitment we make to each other today ensures that we will work together to always promote a positive and constructive discourse in our critically important work as representatives of the American people.  This job is not about any one of us individually, but about the hundreds of thousands of people we represent throughout our districts. As a Representative of the people's House, we are expected to provide positive leadership, a strong voice, and to set the example for the American people.  The ability to agree to disagree and to voice our differences is a critical part of the unique freedoms we cherish as Americans, but we must always do so respectfully. Malicious discourse is a disservice to those who risked their lives to fight for our freedoms and everything that our great Nation stands for.  It is truly unfortunate that the tone of political discourse throughout our Nation has become so contentious and hostile. It is detrimental to fostering an open and productive dialogue and the unity of our The commitment our class makes today solidifies this promise to work together peacefully to provide leadership and inspiration to the American people, while further promoting the freedoms and individual rights that make our Nation the greatest in the world.  We must look at 2017 positively, as a time for new beginnings. In the wake of new leadership, we are provided with a new opportunity for a fresh start and the chance to advance our shared mission of putting the American people first. It is my hope that the efforts of our great freshman class today, which, I argue, could be one of the greatest of this august body's history, will inspire people throughout the Nation to turn toward civility and to always treat each other with respect, despite our differences.

You tell me, and we will yield back and get this done.  I want to talk about the nomination of Scott Pruitt and how this important vote will impact my home So many folks call Montana home today because their parents or grandparents or great-grandparents pushed west to start a new life in the homestead era. My family is no different.  I am proud and honored that my wife and I are still able to farm the land that my grandparents homesteaded over a century ago. I know that it does not matter if you are growing alfalfa, winter wheat, spring wheat, safflower, or garbanzo beans. I know it doesn't matter if you are raising cattle or sheep or hogs. You have to have access to clean water or you cannot succeed in agriculture.  In Montana, agriculture is the number one industry. Local economies around our State are driven by that agriculture economy, whether it is farms or ranches. In a good year, our State's wheat production alone will clear a trillion dollars.  This production not only helps create jobs and farms and ranches but it boosts the bottom line for the local grocery store, the hardware store, and local construction crews keep busy. Agriculture is the backbone of Montana's economy, but it is not the only industry in Montana that relies on clean air and clean water.  Montana's outdoor economy is growing rapidly every year. Hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping generate over $6 billion and sustain over 64,000 jobs in Montana each and every year. More folks are visiting Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks every summer.  And when they visit, these folks spend millions of dollars in communities outside the parks.

1178,topic-id,992,"Madam President, folks are coming to Montana from all over this country because of our clean air and clean water and the habitat it provides. Not only Montanans, but this entire country respects clean air and clean water. In fact, in Montana, it is Montana's Constitution that says we value clean air and clean water.  The reason we place such a high importance on clean air and clean water is because we see what happens when it is put at risk. On numerous occasions, Montanans have been victims to corporations who treated Montana like a Third World country. They reaped the value of our natural resources, and then they left the American taxpayer to clean up the mess. Folks like the Anaconda Company, W.Grace, Glencore, just to name a few.  They left a mess. It wasn't the EPA that left that mess. It was these corporations, and it is the EPA's job to make sure they clean up this mess, not out of the pocketbook of the American taxpayer. These folks, these corporations, have put our clean air and clean water at risk. Not only did they contaminate the land, they contaminated our local economies. One of the largest Superfund sites in this country is in Butte, It took 16 years, nearly $150 million to clean up just a portion--just a small portion of what the Anaconda Company left behind after mining copper in Southwest  In Libby, hundreds of people have died, and over 1,000 people are ill because of asbestosis due to asbestos exposure. Even though a local vermiculite mine closed in 1990, folks are still getting sick due to asbestos-related diseases.  And for years, I have been fighting alongside the folks at Columbia Falls, MT, to hold Glencore accountable to that community for the cyanide and arsenic they left abandoned on the banks of the Flathead River near the gateway of Glacier National  Companies that put our clean water at risk cannot be trusted because they never stick around to clean up the mess they have made. We have seen it firsthand. And that is why we need an EPA Administrator who is going to side with the American taxpayer, with local economies, with local families, and hold the polluters and contaminators accountable for their shortsighted actions.  It is for these reasons that I cannot support Scott Pruitt's nomination for Administrator of the Throughout his career, he has consistently sided with the big polluters over the local businesses and the local families.  I am not convinced that Mr.Pruitt understands the critical role that clean air and clean water plays in agriculture and our outdoor economies. In my conversations with Mr.Pruitt, I received no assurances that he will be a[[Page S1388]]champion for Montana's family farmers, ranchers, those who love to hunt, fish, and hike in Big Sky Mr.Pruitt has endorsed policies that will put Montana jobs at risk and put our outdoor heritage on the ropes.  Don't just take my word for it. Thousands of Montanans have contacted my office regarding Mr.Pruitt's nomination. Caitlin from Libby wrote me:       No community understands the grave impact lack of      regulation or failure to enforce environmental regulations      can have on a community like Libby does. Four hundred people      died in Libby because W.Grace mined vermiculite that was      contaminated with asbestos. . . . These people died . . .      when they were just doing their job. Libby doesn't want or      need another person that looks the other way while big      corporations prey on hard-working people.  Stephen from Corvallis wrote:       I am a farmer in Montana, and I regularly use pesticides,      where I hope the EPA has my back to make sure these things      are safe for me and the environment. . . . Farming continues      to be less predictable, due to a change in climate. I want      someone in that position that has my back as a farmer, not      someone that questions broad scientific consensus.  Rich is a retired public lands manager from Stevensville who wrote me saying this about Pruitt:       Is not fit to be leading an agency responsible for      protecting wildlife, clean water, clean air, and leading the      charge of addressing a changing climate. Pruitt is anti-     science, routinely disregarding well-established studies      involving climate change. I recently retired . . . the      thought of the possible damage and undoing of what I've lived      and worked for over my [entire] life by this man is      disheartening to say the least.  Look, folks, the Earth's climate is changing. There is no ifs, ands, or buts about that. If we want to be able to continue to take our fly rod and go fishing down those rivers, you have to have somebody in the EPA who will ensure that we have clean water and clean air. I will tell you something that happened in Montana for the first time this year. The Yellowstone River closed. The bottom reason for it was the water warmed that much. If you are going to have good habitat for fisheries, if you are going to have good habitat for elk and big game hunting, if you are going to be able to go up in the mountains and hike, fish, bike, and do the things we do in Montana, you have to have somebody in the EPA that makes a difference.  What we do today will not be felt today. It will be felt tomorrow. That is why today we need a man in the position of EPA who will fight for clean water and clean air. It is critical to our survival, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Stephen, Caitlyn and Rich are right.

The Department of the Interior is vital to Montana's economy, and I am glad to see someone from the West selected to lead it.  The job of the Interior Secretary is critically important, especially today as America's public lands come under attack by way too many folks who want to see them transferred to the States or outright sold off. Selling them off to the States is the first step in selling our public lands to the highest bidder, and we can't let that happen.  Congressman Zinke has publicly said that he will not sell off our public lands nor transfer them to the States, and in Montana, your word is your bond.

That is why, when a foreign mining company threatened the gateway to Yellowstone National Park, I was pleased that Congressman Zinke expressed interest in joining me and local[[Page S1433]]businesses and community leaders to protect it. I look forward to working with him to permanently safeguard the doorstep of Yellowstone National Park because Montanans know there are some places more valuable than gold, and Yellowstone is one of those places.  I feel confident that Congressman Zinke will handle the issues before him with Montana common sense--issues like our national parks, and coming up with a responsible solution to the deferred maintenance backlog that is wreaking havoc on our national park system; the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and how to work with Congress and work in this administration to ensure full and devoted funding to initiatives like LWCF, the visionary Land and Water Conservation Fund; in Indian country, living up to our trust responsibilities that we owe to America's sovereign Indian nations; and in resource development, how to responsibly manage our public lands for energy and resource development, and how to balance that with respect to clean water and clean air and wildlife.  Of course, there are always some issues where Congressman Zinke and I don't see eye-to-eye, but he has publicly committed to working with Congress to try and address some of the most important issues of this Nation's economy as it applies to our public lands. Montana's economy is no exception, and I will take him at his word.  As a Montanan, I know how important the Department of the Interior is to our way of life, and I am optimistic that Congressman Zinke will do right by Montana and the country in his new role.

98,topic-id,554,"Mr.Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman Bishop[[Page H1155]]for not only yielding me the time, but for his patience and diligence and understanding this issue, and I also want to thank Subcommittee Chairman McClintock for the work that he has put into it.  The Natural Resources Committee has conducted hearings on this issue. They have reported out bills related to this issue in the last two Congresses, and last Congress, the whole House voted for a bill that deals with this issue. I am grateful to Chairman Bishop and Subcommittee Chair McClintock for all of that effort.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is just a small sliver of what this House has passed before. This bill requires the Federal Government to do what the Federal Government should have done long ago, and that is to conduct a survey along the Red River following the instructions of the United States Supreme That is all this bill does.  It does not dispose of any land; it does not alter the rights or claims of any State, any tribe, any individual. It just says the Federal Government has a responsibility to know what the Federal Government is supposed to be controlling. They have never, ever conducted a survey of this area, and so this bill says: You will have a survey conducted using the method that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held is a method you ought to use.  I am a little taken aback, Mr.Speaker, on why that should be controversial. We could go on at some length about how this came to be. It is interesting, historically, and we could go into a variety of details and so forth; but, again, the bottom line is the Federal law currently says the Federal Government has a responsibility to inventory and ascertain where Federal land is. Yet the Bureau of Land Management not only has never done it in close to 100 years after the Supreme Court decision, the Bureau of Land Management has said they never intend to. They will never conduct a survey of this 116-mile area.  So this bill, as I say, is very simple. It says the Bureau of Land Management shall commission a survey, jointly agreed upon by Texas and Oklahoma, tribal and other interests a full part of that, but there will, once and for all, be a survey to determine where the Federal claim is and where the Federal claim is not.  Now, part of the reason that is so important is because the Bureau of Land Management has, especially in 2013, come out and made a variety of claims that has thrown in doubt the proper title and ownership of land that has been in families for generations, that people have paid taxes on for generations. That has put a cloud on title of private landowners, and it does not help that cloud when the Bureau of Land Management says: We will never conduct a survey to determine exactly where the claim is.  So everyone, Mr.Speaker, every State, every tribe, every local government, every individual--even the Federal Government and the BLM itself--deserves to know where the claims rightfully are and where the claims are rightfully not.  First step is information. That is all this bill does. I think it is pretty clear that we should at least take this step.

223,topic-id,1350,"Mr.President, yesterday we began yet another week of considering Cabinet nominations in the Senate--our fourth week, to be precise--and we still have a long way to go. If anyone is wondering whether this is a normal confirmation process, the answer is no, it is not. Historically, Senate practice has been to quickly confirm a President's Cabinet nominees. President Obama had six nominees confirmed on his first day as President and nearly all the rest within the first 2 weeks. This tradition of speedy confirmation goes back a long way. By the point in every Presidency since President Eisenhower's, most, if not all, of the President's Cabinet nominees had been confirmed by now. Between 1881 and 1933, every incoming President had all of his Cabinet nominees confirmed on day one.  What is the reason for this? Historically, Senators of both parties have recognized that Cabinet officials play an essential part in getting an administration up and running, doing the business of the American people. Once the American people elect a President, the thinking historically has gone that it is only right that the President be given the advisers he needs to do the job he was elected to do--that is, until now.  This year, Democrats decided that they have had enough of timely Cabinet confirmations, that they have had enough of bipartisanship. Since President Trump was inaugurated, Democrats have done everything they can to drag out his Cabinet nominations. We don't have to take my word for it; here is what Politico had to say:       Senate Democrats . . . are slow-walking the installation of      Trump's Cabinet to a historic degree. . . . They are voting      against Trump's Cabinet picks in unprecedented numbers.  Two weeks ago, the Washington Post published a piece titled ``Trump's confirmations really are taking longer than his predecessors.''  ``Democrats,'' the Post noted, ``have tried to slow the process, invoking arcane parliamentary procedure to force delays, and boycotting committee meetings to prevent votes.''  For a party that has spent a lot of time complaining about obstruction, Democrats really are taking it to new heights. Thanks to Democrats' obstruction, the Senate has had to spend so much time confirming nominees that we have had very little time for actual legislative business. We still have a long way to go to finish confirming the President's Cabinet, unless the Democrats decide to stop their obstruction. Democrats aren't even really accomplishing anything with their delays.  Thanks to the rules change that they put in place in 2013--that was something that was engineered in 2013 where they literally broke the rules to change the rules--they can't actually prevent President Trump's nominees from being confirmed. The only thing they can do is to tie up the business of the Senate and delay work on legislation to address the challenges that are facing American families.  Democrats may not like President Trump, but it is high time they get used to the fact that he is our Democrats are not helping anyone by preventing the President from having a fully functioning administration. It is time for Democrats to abandon the obstruction, confirm the President's nominees, and allow the Senate to move forward with the business of the American people.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, in addition to Cabinet nominees, the Senate will be considering another key nomination in the coming weeks, and that is Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  I met with Judge Gorsuch last week, and our meeting confirmed my opinion that President Trump could not have made a better pick for the By now, I think Judge Gorsuch's qualifications are well known: his exceptional intelligence, his gift for the written word, his outstanding resume, and, most of all, his clear understanding of the proper role of a judge.  In his remarks at the White House after accepting the nomination, Judge Gorsuch spoke of judges' obligation to follow the law ``as they find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs.''  ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.'' Judge Gorsuch has said those words more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law.  That is a problem. The job of a judge is to interpret the law, not write it--to call the balls and strikes, not to rewrite the rules of the game. Everyone's rights are put in jeopardy when judges step outside of their role and start changing the meaning of the law to suit their personal opinions.  Judge Gorsuch doesn't just understand judges' responsibility; he lives it. He has won respect from liberals and conservatives alike for his deep commitment to following the law wherever[[Page S1149]]it leads, even when he doesn't like the results.  Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       I have seen him up close and in action, both in court and      on the Federal Appellate Rules Committee (where both of us      serve); he brings a sense of fairness and decency to the job,      and a temperament that suits the nation's highest court. . .      . I, for one, wish it were a Democrat choosing the next      justice.       But since that is not to be, one basic criteria should be      paramount: Is the nominee someone who will stand up for the      rule of law and say no to a president or Congress that strays      beyond the Constitution and laws?       I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help      to restore confidence in the rule of law.       His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial      independence--a record that should give the American people      confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the      president who appointed him.  Again, those are not the words of a That is what Neal Katyal, formerly an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge It is pretty high praise coming from a  One of the Democrats' favorite tactics is to accuse Republican nominees of being extremists, no matter how mainstream they actually are. No matter how hard they try, I don't think they are going to have much success with that tactic against Judge  When liberal after liberal attests to his fairness and impartiality, it is pretty hard to pretend he is anything but an excellent pick for the Supreme  Then there are the stats from his time on the Tenth Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported:       Judge Gorsuch has written some 800 opinions since joining      the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006.       Only 1.75 percent (14 opinions) drew dissents from his      colleagues.       That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous, even on a      circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by      Democratic Presidents and five by  So it is a very divided circuit court in terms of the composition. Let me repeat that last line.       That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous even on a      circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by      Democratic Presidents and five by  When 98 percent of your opinions are unanimous, it is pretty much impossible to argue that you are somehow outside of the judicial mainstream. Very few of Judge Gorsuch's decisions have gone to the Supreme When they have, they have been almost universally upheld--often, unanimously. I wish Democrats luck in portraying Judge Gorsuch as an extremist. I think they are going to have a very uphill climb.  Both liberals and conservatives recognize that Judge Gorsuch is a supremely qualified jurist who would make a terrific addition to the Supreme I hope that Senate Democrats will listen to the consensus in favor of his nomination and abandon their threats of obstruction. Democrats spend a lot of time talking about the importance of confirming a ninth Justice to the Now they are going to have a chance to confirm an outstanding nominee. I hope they take it.

1489,topic-id,911,"Mr.President, I rise to voice my strong support for the nomination of Wilbur Ross to be Secretary of We held a hearing on his nomination on January 18, 2017. Mr.Ross has also completed the required paperwork and responded to all of the committee questions for the record. Five weeks ago, on January 24, the Commerce Committee acted by voice vote to favorably report his nomination to the floor. We invoked cloture on Mr.Ross's nomination by a vote margin of 66 to 31 on February 17, with 15 Democratic Senators voting to invoke cloture.  I am glad the Senate will finally confirm his nomination today after a long and unnecessary delay. When he is confirmed, Mr.Ross will bring decades of business, entrepreneurial, and civic experience to this important position.  Mr.Ross is perhaps best known for his expertise in revitalizing distressed businesses, such as those in the U.steel industry. At a time when most investors had abandoned the industry, he organized the International Steel Group in 2002, and through acquisitions, he made it the largest integrated steel company in North Later, it merged with Mittal Steel to form the largest steel company in the world. It is for this reason that all of the major steel-industry labor unions also support his confirmation.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support for the confirmation of Wilbur Ross from the United Steelworkers, dated January 9, 2017, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.

1494,topic-id,1163,"Madam President, 2 weeks ago, major health insurer Humana announced its decision to completely withdraw from ObamaCare exchanges for 2018. The company decision was not particularly surprising. Humana had already sharply reduced its participation in the exchanges for 2017, but the decision did confirm yet again that President Obama's healthcare law is on its last legs.  Choices on the exchanges declined sharply for 2017 as insurer after insurer cut back on participation. Nearly one-third of U.counties have just one choice of insurer on their exchange for 2017. Meanwhile premiums on the exchanges are soaring. Exchange premiums increased a staggering 25 percent on average for 2017. That is a 25-percent premium increase for just 1 year. How many working families can afford a 25-percent increase in their healthcare premiums for 1 year?  Things are even worse in some Seven States saw an average premium increase of more than 50 percent for 1 year. It is no surprise that many people who have ObamaCare insurance have found they can't afford to actually use their plan. Well, Democrats can talk about coverage all they want, but coverage doesn't mean much if you can't afford to actually take advantage of it.  It is time to give the American people some relief. Over the next few weeks, Congress will continue with the process of repealing and replacing Our priority is replacing ObamaCare with personalized, patient-centered healthcare that is affordable for every ObamaCare was supposed to lower healthcare costs for Americans, but it has spectacularly failed to do so. Our reform efforts will focus on keeping healthcare affordable, including increasing competition, expanding innovation, and increasing flexibility.  ObamaCare has defaulted to a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to healthcare. That means that many Americans have found themselves paying for healthcare that they don't need or want.  We need much more flexibility in insurance plans. A thriving healthcare system would offer a wide variety of choices that would allow Americans to pick a plan that is tailored to their needs. We also need to give Americans the tools to better manage their healthcare and to control costs. Along with keeping healthcare affordable, we are going to focus on restoring decisionmaking power to the American people.  ObamaCare has put Washington bureaucrats in charge of healthcare decisions that should be made by individuals in consultation with their doctor. We are going to move control away from Washington and give it back to individuals. We are also going to ensure that States have the power to innovate and embrace healthcare solutions that work for individuals and employers in their  Our healthcare system wasn't perfect before ObamaCare--nobody is denying that--but ObamaCare has just made things worse. The American people are ready for healthcare reform that actually works, and that is exactly what Republicans are going to give them.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Madam President, in addition to healthcare reform, another Republican[[Page S1440]]priority for this spring is confirming Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme The Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on his confirmation beginning March 20, and I am hopeful Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed not too long thereafter. President Trump made an outstanding choice when he chose Judge Gorsuch for the Supreme  Judge Gorsuch has a distinguished resume. He graduated with honors from Harvard Law School and received a doctorate from Oxford University where he was a Marshall He clerked for two Supreme Court Justices, Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, and he worked in both private practice and at the Justice Department before being nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he served with distinction for the last 10 years.  He is widely regarded as a brilliant and thoughtful jurist and a gifted writer whose opinions are known for their clarity. Above all, however, he is known for his impartiality, for his commitment to following the law wherever it leads, whether he likes the results or not. ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge,'' Judge Gorsuch has said more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law, and that is a problem. The job of a judge is to interpret the law, not write it, to call the balls and strikes, not to rewrite the rules of the game.  Everyone's rights are put in jeopardy when judges step outside their role and start changing the law to suit their personal opinions. Judge Gorsuch's nomination has been met with acclaim from conservatives, and it has also been met with acclaim from liberals. I think one of the biggest reasons for that is because both groups know Judge Gorsuch can be relied on to judge impartially.  Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General, had to say about Judge Gorsuch: ``His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record that should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the president who appointed him.''  The Colorado Springs Gazette recently highlighted a letter signed by 96 prominent Colorado lawyers and judges and sent to the senior Senator from Here is what those individuals had to say about Judge Gorsuch in that letter:       We hold a diverse set of political views as Republicans,      Democrats, and       Many of us have been critical of actions taken by President      Nonetheless, we all agree that Judge Gorsuch is      exceptionally well-qualified to join the Supreme We      know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of utmost character. He is      fair, decent, and honest, both as a judge and a person. His      record shows that he believes strongly in the independence of      the judiciary.  Well, that is a pretty significant tribute. Again, those weren't just conservatives speaking.  Given Judge Gorsuch's character, his sterling record, and deep commitment to impartiality and the rule of law, it is no surprise that his nomination has won support from liberals and conservatives alike or that the American people are liking what they see when it comes to Judge  Well-known Democratic pollster Mark Penn recently noted that Judge Gorsuch is ``off to an excellent start in his nomination process.'' Unfortunately, there are still far-left extremists who would like to see Democrats in the Senate attempt to block Judge Gorsuch's confirmation, but I am hopeful that my colleagues will ignore these voices for obstruction and, instead, listen to the many voices--liberal and conservative--that are highlighting just why Judge Gorsuch would be an outstanding addition to the Supreme  I recently met with Judge Gorsuch, and I could not have been more impressed. I look forward to hearing from him again at his confirmation hearings, and I hope the Senate will act to confirm him shortly thereafter.

241,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, I think a little background will be helpful. The Social Security Administration has promulgated a rule regarding when its employees should be sending names to be added to the NICS system. The NICS system is the system by which a person, when they are added to it, may not legally possess a firearm.  The rule has been finalized, but it has not yet gone into effect. It is scheduled to go into effect on December 19 this year. I wish to say, I think the rule has the right intention. Under Federal statute, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 stipulates that every quarter each Federal agency must send to the Attorney General any information it has showing that any person is disqualified from possessing a gun.  Each agency also has the responsibility to correct or update any information it sends to the Attorney There is no question the Social Security Administration has a duty to send information to the NICS system.  The purpose of the rule is to send to NICS the names of individuals who are dangerously mentally ill and thus are not legally entitled to a firearm. There are some protections that are provided in this rule. For instance, under the rule promulgated by the Social Security Administration, a third party cannot get a gun owner declared mentally ill without the gun owner's knowledge or consent. Under this rule, the individual has to file a disability claim for himself or herself.  The rule provides some mechanisms for individuals to challenge their inclusion in the NICS system if they wish to do so. There is serious disagreement and confusion about some other very important aspects of this rule.  For instance, I have heard from advocates for people with disabilities. They are very concerned that the list of mental illnesses, for instance, is to too expansive and might very well sweep in people who have mental health issues but are not at all dangerous to themselves or to others.  These advocates for people with disabilities have also expressed the concern that the rule doesn't require that a medical professional actually be involved in the determination of whether a person is dangerously mentally ill.  These disability rights advocates raise the concern that an agency bureaucrat without any medical expertise could potentially add someone to the NICS system without a doctor being involved and without that person being in any way dangerous.  These advocates also argue that there is not a sufficient process for individuals who are wrongly denied their Second Amendment rights. For instance, under the rule, it appears it could take years for an individual to adjudicate this question if there was a case of mistaken identity or they were deemed to have a mental health issue that they challenged. It could take years for them to resolve. All that time they would be disqualified from owning a firearm. Even if that individual prevailed and it turned out that the Social[[Page S1157]]Security Administration had mistakenly put them in the NICS system, their legal fees would still have to be incurred by the individual, despite the fact that they had no responsibility for this.  I agree something ought to be done in this area, but I am not fully confident this rule gets it exactly right. My preferred outcome here, my ideal, would be for the Social Security Administration to produce a new rule--one that takes into account these legitimate concerns that have been raised, especially by people in the disability rights community. I would look forward to working with the Social Security Administration, and I could very well support such a rule, and I would support such a rule if they addressed these things properly.  I would further say that we have time to do this. As I mentioned earlier, while the rule has been finalized, it has not yet gone into effect. It doesn't go into effect until December 19 of this year. We have over 10 months to reconsider and get this right.  Some have suggested, wait a minute, we will never have a chance to redo this if we pass the Congressional Review Act, which repeals this rule because it will preclude the Social Security Administration from promulgating a new version of the rule.  People say that because the Congressional Review Act states that if we enact this resolution of disapproval ``a new rule that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued.''  It is my opinion that a new rule issued by the Social Security Administration that addresses appropriately the concerns I mentioned would certainly not be substantially the same as the current rule. It would be a very different rule. Since it would not be substantially the same, it would be permissible under the Congressional Review Act for the Social Security Administration to correct these flaws and come up with a new rule.  I want to ask the senior Senator from Texas, the majority whip and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is it your opinion that if subsequent to passage of the Congressional Review Act with respect to this rule, if the Social Security Administration promulgated a new rule that met the standards I have set forth, that in that case, the new rule would not be substantially the same as the current rule and therefore would not be precluded by passage of the Congressional Review Act; is that the opinion of the Senator from Texas?

632,topic-id,612,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to talk about one of the consequences of Donald Trump's refugee ban that has so far been ignored.  The day after Donald Trump issued his executive order to ban refugees and all citizens from seven Muslim majority countries, four children from El Salvador landed in Miami International  It is a short flight from El Salvador, but the children had been waiting a long time to come here. In 2015, they applied to come here through the Central American Minors program that was started in 2014 as a safe and legal way for a limited--a very small--number of children from Central  After submitting to DNA tests, screenings, and a long application process, they were finally given visas, and they were on their way here. However, after landing at Miami and passing through the Customs and Border Protection screening, and on their way to their connecting flight, they were stopped and pulled into a secondary inspection. For six long hours, these children were detained in a cold room without food or water.  These children had done everything right, and waited a long time to flee a very traumatic situation. They came here, and their first experience was to be treated like criminals.  This is just one example of how Trump's hasty, harmful executive order is undermining our American values. It is just one more reason why, instead of rewriting it, as he says that he is doing, he should rescind it altogether.  But, of course, these children are the lucky ones, the fortunate few who got a chance to come here legally.  Many of my colleagues will recall that, in the summer of 2014, thousands of children from Central America arrived at our southern border. Those children were fleeing gangs and violence. Many of them turned themselves in to the Border They were not trying to sneak in to our country. They were asking for asylum. They were asking for relief and protection.  We knew that if we were going to stop kids from making that dangerous journey to come here, some of them walking over 1,000 miles to our southern border, that we would have to tackle the root causes that compelled them to leave. So the leaders of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, with some help from General John Kelly, came up with a plan to bring some stability to those three countries. And Congress, working on a bipartisan basis, provided some financial support.  But even as we make long-term investments in the Northern Triangle, we need to deal with the fact that children from these countries still need our protection in the short-term. That is why the Obama administration created a few programs to help a very small number of those children.  Those children did what we asked them. They didn't come across our border. They didn't cross They waited in line as they were told, even if waiting in line meant staying in harm's way. Because of Donald Trump's executive order, those children now face a very uncertain future.  Lost in the media coverage of this order is the suspension of the refugee program, blockage of these vulnerable children as well. I am glad that the judge has stayed the order. I hope that the President will respect the judge's order.  But more than that, I hope that the President will take a real look at all the harm that he has already caused for so many people, including so many innocent children. I hope that he puts an end to his cruel, counterproductive executive order once and for all.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Jonah was only 8 years old when he was killed last week in a drive-by shooting in my home city of  Jonah, his parents, and his brother were enjoying dinner hosted by friends of his parents, two schoolteachers, when a bullet ripped through the house and hit Crimes like this are heartbreaking.  A talented soccer player, an avid reader who loved superheroes, Jonah was an adopted child from a Taiwanese orphanage just 3 years ago. It eats at your soul to think that such a young child with his whole life ahead of him could be taken so ruthlessly. Perhaps most frustrating is that Jonah's killer is still at large.  When I first heard of Jonah's death, it brought me back to a similar tragedy when I served as mayor of my home city of In 2006, little Ethan Esparza was shot and killed while he was playing in his front yard during his birthday party. He would have turned 4 years old.  Ethan's murder shocked our community and was a stark reminder of the violence that plagues our city. Sadly, over 10 years later, we are still fighting those same battles.  The murders of Jonah and Ethan were completely senseless, but they are not rare. In fact, Pomona was recently ranked California's eighth most dangerous city, which doesn't surprise those of us who have seen gangs take ahold of our city.  Our local police department puts their lives on the line every single day to try to keep us safe, and our local officials have made significant investments in law enforcement. During my time as mayor, we implemented gang injunctions to try to get hold of the problem.                              {time}  1015  But as the number of guns on the streets continues to rise and ruthless gang members get their hands on these deadly weapons, it often feels like a losing battle. We are alone fighting these battles.  As a matter of fact, today marks the 23rd anniversary of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, better known as the Brady bill, which has blocked more than 3 million people who had no business owning a gun from buying a gun from a federally licensed dealer.  As the new President makes his first address to Congress today, it is especially infuriating that, despite the countless gun-related tragedies occurring across our country, this Congress and this new administration have not taken one single step to reduce gun violence. I have come to this floor before demanding action, and I stand here before you yet again today, Mr.Speaker, to demand action on behalf of Jonah, of Ethan, and of the millions of innocent lives lost.  There are steps that we can take immediately to expand the Brady bill to save lives and make our communities safer:  First, we should close the loophole that allows guns to be sold online or at gun shows without background checks.[[Page H1361]]  Second, we should make sure that there are resources available to research gun violence--research. We can't find effective solutions if we can't research and understand the problem.  Lastly, we should enhance the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, and make sure that States are inputting records in a way that allows Federal agencies to run complete background checks on individuals. Background checks are only as effective as the quality of the records in the background check system.  There is no excuse for making it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a deadly weapon. It is my deepest hope that this Congress will take action on gun control so that none of us has to attend another vigil in Pomona--or anywhere else in America--to honor the memory of another child taken from us much too soon.

My late husband, Senator Paul Tsongas, helped write the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980. He worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska to craft legislation that balanced conservation with responsible economic development for Alaskans, including oil exploration, mining, timber harvesting, and sport hunting.  But he also stated on the Senate floor, back in 1980: ``Nature made the wilderness and wildlife in Alaska majestic during hundreds of thousands of years. Man''--and, I would add, woman--``is challenged merely to respect and preserve that natural majesty.''  He also spoke on the Senate floor about conversations at the dinner table with our then 6-year-old daughter, who asked what her father was doing to protect endangered species. Well, our daughter has grown now, but here we are 37 years later in Congress debating if that bipartisan law crafted with my late husband allows hunters to shoot bear cubs and wolf pups in their den on a national wildlife refuge.  My colleagues are correct that ANILCA, as that law is known, and other Federal laws give the State of Alaska unique privileges and responsibilities to oversee wildlife management on public lands; however, this is not a carte blanche. There has never been a right to set policies on national wildlife refuges that are inconsistent with bedrock environmental laws or ANILCA's mandate to conserve species and habitats in their natural diversity on wildlife refuges.  I fully support the Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to no longer turn a blind eye to harmful practices that are detrimental to nationally significant species and are not rooted in science-based wildlife management practices.

I want to underscore a few of Representative Mulvaney's previous statements made as a Member of  First, he has supported playing chicken with the debt ceiling over partisan political issues, an action that would jeopardize the U.Government's ability to repay the public debt. If the debt ceiling is not raised, Federal officials have said that the revenue coming into the government would not be enough to cover its obligations--potentially disrupting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, military payments, student loan payments, and many other government services.  Despite these clear dangers, Representative Mulvaney voted no on raising the debt ceiling every time it came up for a vote in 2011, 2012, and 2013. He claimed that risking disruption to Social Security and veterans benefits was ``a fabricated crisis.'' He went so far as to question the majority leader, claiming that, if the Senate chose to raise the debt ceiling, the majority leader ``should just quit and go home.'' I, for one, will be here to defend the full faith and credit of the United[[Page S1208]]States' public debt and protect essential government services that our sick, our elderly, and our veterans depend upon.  Putting someone with such strongly held and reckless views into power at the OMB is an endorsement of policies that could cause another global financial crisis--devastating millions of American families. I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for this reason alone.  Second, Representative Mulvaney is a founding member of the group of extreme House Republicans who forced the government to shut down in October 2013 over their blind opposition to the Affordable Care In New Mexico, the impacts of the shutdown were felt immediately as our civilian employees were sent home from military installations, national parks and forests were closed to tourists, and countless other services were halted. The shutdown lasted over two weeks, and Representative Mulvaney and other members of his extreme wing of the House could have ended the shutdown at any time.  Representative Mulvaney claims that he opposes wasteful government spending, but an analysis by Standard and Poor's found that the October 2013 government shutdown cost $24 billion--$24 billion with nothing to show for it. Even Representative Mulvaney admitted that his shutdown hurt people. On October 16, 2013, he told CNN, ``Were people hurt by this? Sure.'' He admitted that, if you were one of the millions of people who relied on the shuttered services, his shutdown hurt you, but Representative Mulvaney showed little remorse. I stand by what I said at the time. Insisting on blind cuts or a government shutdown to prove a point isn't leadership.  Third and finally, Representative Mulvaney is on record advocating enormous cuts to Medicare, and he is a proponent of Speaker Ryan's preferred voucher concept for He also has long been hostile to Social Security and voted in the South Carolina State Senate to declare Social Security, along with Medicaid and the Department of Education, unconstitutional.  Workers earn their Social Security benefits through a lifetime of paying into the Social Security system. And it is unfair to delay or cut the benefits they have paid into. Raising the retirement age to 70, as Representative Mulvaney has advocated, would cut benefits by nearly 20 percent for all beneficiaries. Raising the retirement age would be hardest for those New Mexicans who work in jobs that require heavy manual labor, which becomes harder to do as we age. With all the challenges people have saving for retirement, especially as New Mexico continues to struggle to recover, the last thing we should do is raise the Social Security retirement age.  In conclusion, Representative Mulvaney has demonstrated that he has no reservations about using a government shutdown or the public debt as bargaining chips. He has stated that he will push to eliminate Social Security for people under 70. He will slash Federal consumer protections and cut support for small businesses, labor rights, financial oversight, community health, and environmental protection. I have heard from many people and groups--a broad coalition of consumer, small business, labor, good government, financial protection, community, health, environmental, civil rights, and public interest organizations--who oppose the nomination.

I voted on this floor many times in support of nominees with whom I have policy differences, but they have been qualified persons, experienced in their field, who believe in the fundamental mission of the agency they are tasked to lead. That is not the case with Attorney General Mr.Pruitt has extreme environmental policy views, and he has zero experience running the Environmental Protection In fact, he does not believe in the fundamental mission of the Attorney General Pruitt made his name opposing EPA rules that protect human health and the environment--fighting against clean air and clean water, disregarding the science behind the EPA's protections for human health and the environment on behalf of for-profit special interests, not the public interest.  He has brought 19 suits against the Eight are currently pending in courts, and if confirmed, he won't recuse himself from all the pending cases. As a lawyer and especially as your State's top lawyer, you shouldn't change sides in litigation. It is just not right. There may be an ethics violation here. I have never heard of a lawyer representing both sides of a case.  Let's look at just a few examples from his litigation records, starting with his opposition to clean air. Mr.Pruitt is leading litigation against the EPA's ozone or smog rule. In 2015 the EPA revised its ambiant air standards[[Page S1379]]for ground level ozone. The EPA was long overdue in revising its ozone standards to protect public health. It even had to be sued by States and environmental organizations to make sure the standards adequately protected human health. High concentrations of ozone are bad for public health, children, and older adults, and people with lung diseases such as asthma are especially vulnerable.  The EPA set a standard of 70 parts per billion. This standard is based on the best science, which included thousands of studies analyzing the effects of ozone on public health. In addition, the EPA built in flexibility for States that would have trouble meeting the standard. But the Oklahoma attorney general currently leads a four-State charge to do away with the rule.  Mr.Pruitt thinks it is OK for powerplants to emit unhealthy levels of mercury and other toxins into the air. In 2011, the EPA passed the mercury and air toxics standards. This rule limits emissions from powerplants of mercury, arsenic, and other metals. Like the ozone standard, this rule was long overdue, and the EPA was forced by the courts to develop the standard.  The science is well established that these toxins are a serious public health threat. Fortunately, there are proven and available technologies to limit the emissions. Scott Pruitt fought the mercury and air toxics standards, and he is still litigating in court against the standards even though the vast majority of powerplants in the Nation are currently in compliance with the standards.  Just to show you how serious this is in my home State of New Mexico, pregnant women and children can only eat a very small amount of fish from the streams of New Our streams are polluted with mercury. The levels are so high that vulnerable populations are advised to severely limit their consumption. Scott Pruitt wants to continue this pollution of our streams.  Mr.Pruitt testified in the hearing before the EPW Committee that he saw a role for the EPA to address pollution that crosses State boundaries, but his litigation history does not support that testimony. As Oklahoma attorney general, he fought the EPA's cross-state air pollution rule, a rule designed to reduce powerplant emissions across State lines that cause smog and pollution and health problems in downwind Especially, the cross-state air pollution rule reduces sulfur dioxide, or SO 2, and oxides of nitrogen or NOX emissions. NOX emissions contribute to fine particle and soot pollution and to ground level ozone formation, otherwise known as smog. Even though this pollution affects the air and health of downwind States, Mr.Pruitt sided with the powerplants.  Air pollution is not the only problem that crosses State lines. River and stream pollution does not stop at State boundaries either. The EPA and the U.Army passed the clean water rule in 2015. The rule clarified a dizzying set of Supreme Court cases defining protected water. The EPA and the Army reviewed the best science, reviewing more than 1200 peer-reviewed public scientific studies to define protected waters.  New Mexico is an arid We have very little surface water. We need to protect all of our surface water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, and recreational uses. By the way, the EPA and the Army's definition of surface waters is no broader than my own State's definition of surface waters. New Mexico's definition is appropriate and reasonable to protect our precious surface water.  The attorney general of Oklahoma is fighting the clean water rule, too, even though it protects against cross-state pollution.  Here is one more example--the Clean Power The Clean Power Plan is our country's best effort to address climate change. We know that climate change is happening. We know that the climate change is primarily caused by humans. We know that powerplants are a major contributor. We know that we need to take action and that we need to take action fast to protect our planet. The Clean Power Plan significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions from existing, modified, and future powerplants. The Clean Power Plan was developed based on the best science. It was developed based on a tremendous amount of input from the States, industry, environmentalists, and others. It provides States with a lot of flexibility with how to comply. Mr.Pruitt, true to form, is litigating against the Clean Power Mr.Pruitt apparently does not understand the science of climate change.  In the National Review in 2016, he wrote: ``Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.'' During his confirmation hearing, he similarly stated:       Science tells us that the climate is changing and human      activity in some manner impacts that change. The human      ability to measure the extent of that impact is subject to      continuing debate and dialogue as well as they should be.  That is not what science tells us. That is maybe what fossil fuel special interests tell him, but that is not what science tells us. His views are not consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change. The 2013 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found it ``extremely likely'' that more than half of the global warming that occurred between 1951 and 2010 was a consequence of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  So many of the decisions made and the regulations passed by the EPA rely heavily upon good science. It is absolutely critical that the EPA Administrator understand and use the best science.  I am not convinced that Mr.Pruitt understands and will use the best science if he is confirmed to lead the  When developing regulations, the EPA must first follow the law's requirements to protect human health and the environment. Then, within the law's requirements, the EPA should take account of input and information from all sources--from industry, environmentalists, States, and public agencies.  I am not convinced that Mr.Pruitt will follow the law's requirements to protect public health and the environment, and I am not convinced that he will take into account the input of all stakeholders. Throughout his career as attorney general, Mr.Pruitt has aligned solely with industry and against public health and the environment. He has no record of aligning with the public or of securing our environment for the future.  As attorney general, he engaged in a scorched earth policy against environmental regulations. He dismantled his environmental protection unit. He became very close politically to the energy industry. He adopted letters written by energy lobbyists almost verbatim, and then submitted them on behalf of the State of Oklahoma in Federal legal proceedings.  As chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association, he became even more closely aligned with the fossil fuel-related companies.  Mr.Pruitt's record is one-sided and extreme, and it does not give me confidence that as EPA Administrator he would have any commitment to protecting the public health now or protecting the environment for future generations.  Finally, I am concerned that Mr.Pruitt has not shown and does not have the proper respect for tribal sovereignty. Oklahoma is home to 39 tribes. Mr.Pruitt's litigation history as attorney general has consistently been anti-tribe. As vice chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I pay special attention to a nominee's record on tribal issues, especially nominees for agencies that will deal with tribes on a government-to-government basis, like the  As Oklahoma's top attorney, Mr.Pruitt routinely sought out ways to fight tribal sovereignty--even all the way to the Highest Court in the land. In Dollar General v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mr.Pruitt filed an amicus brief in support of a corporation that refused to submit to tribal jurisdiction. Mr.Pruitt's side lost. This case is a prime example of Mr.Pruitt's misguided views of tribe and their inherent sovereignty. Indian Country needs an EPA Administrator who respects tribal sovereignty. I am not convinced Mr.Pruitt does.  Just recently we had in town the National Council of American They submitted a letter on January 18. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.[[Page S1380]]  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              National Congress of                                             American Indians,                                 Washington, DC, January 18, 2016.     Re Indian Country's Concerns with EPA Administrator Nominee          Scott     John Barrasso,     Chairman, U.Senate Committee on Environment and Public          Works, Washington,     Thomas Carper,     Ranking Member, U.Senate Committee on Environment and          Public Works, Washington,       Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: On behalf      of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the      oldest, largest, and most representative American Indian and      Alaska Native organization serving the broad interests of      Tribal governments and communities, I am writing to express      our deep concern with the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney      General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on his history of      fighting environmental regulations and the new      Administration's statements denying the existence of climate      change. The continuing impacts of climate change are a major      concern of Tribal Nations and, before this Committee votes to      move forward with Attorney General Pruitt's nomination to      lead the EPA, it must thoroughly consider the potential      impacts that his nomination will have on climate change, the      protection of natural resources, and protection of Tribal      trust and treaty rights.       American Indians and Alaska Natives are disproportionately      impacted by climate change due to our geographical areas and      direct connection and reliance on the surrounding      environments. It is threatening to destroy our lands, waters,      and natural resources, which will impact our traditional and      customary ways of life that has been sustainable for      thousands of years. The well-documented plight of Alaska      Native villages is probably the most profound manifestation      of the climate crisis and requires focused, high priority      attention from the federal government. NCAI's Tribal      leadership and members have spoken strongly on climate change      by passing four resolutions in the past four years calling      for action and setting Tribal Climate Change Principles      calling on further federal action and partnership with Tribal      governments.       The federal government's treaty and trust responsibilities      to protect Indian lands includes the duty to protect lands      from the impacts of climate change, which requires not only      that sufficient federal resources be equitably allocated to      address climate change, but that Tribes be included as      partners to solve these issues. Federal programs and policies      must allow Tribal Nations to engage effectively in adaptation      and mitigation strategies that will help ensure the integrity      of our cultures, homelands, infrastructures, and services.      Further, it is imperative that federal agencies enforce      Tribal treaty and reserved rights to both on- and off-     reservation resources.       The EPA's mission to protect human health and the      environment means that it plays an essential role in fighting      climate change-related impacts. Due to its charge, EPA also      has a sacred responsibility to uphold and protect Tribal      trust and treaty rights through the protection of Tribal      natural resources. In fact, the EPA acknowledges the      importance of reviewing how agency actions will impact treaty      rights in its recent policy guidance EPA Policy on      Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes: Guidance      for Discussing Tribal Treaty       Since the EPA is critical to combating climate change and      protecting Tribal trust and treaty rights, Indian country is      deeply concerned with Attorney General Pruitt's nomination to      head the It is our understanding that, in his role as      Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma, Pruitt has      repeatedly filed suits against the EPA for its regulations      seeking to protect the environment. Further, his nomination      comes from an incoming Administration which claims that      climate change is a ``hoax'' and questions whether the EPA      should continue to exist.       This Committee must ensure that attorney General Pruitt      understands and acknowledges the realities of human impacts      on global climate change, the need for the EPA and federal      regulations to protect the environment, and the importance of      EPA's role in protecting Tribal lands, waters, and natural      resources. We must get his commitment on the record to      sustain the EPA's role in fighting climate change and      protecting Tribal trust and treaty rights. Without these      acknowledgements, Indian Country cannot support Attorney      General Pruitt's nomination for Administrator of the       We are at a critical moment in combating the increasing      climate changes effects from human-made sources.

1149,topic-id,551,"Madam President, I would like to just read a couple of paragraphs from the letter.       On behalf of the National Congress of American Indians      (NCAI), the oldest, largest, and most representative American      Indian and Alaskan Native organization serving the broad      interests of tribal governments and communities, I am writing      to express our deep concern of the nomination of Oklahoma      attorney general Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the      Environmental Protection Agency based on his history of      fighting environmental regulations and the new      Administration's statements denying the existence of climate      change.

We are at a critical moment in combating the increasing      climate change effects from human-made sources. Indian      Country, the United States, and the world cannot afford to      take a backseat role in fighting climate change.  In conclusion, my concerns about Mr.Pruitt's record on environmental policy aren't just because we disagree on policy. Mr.Pruitt has made his reputation in litigating fiercely against the EPA's most important regulations to protect public health and the environment, clean air, clean water, toxics on land--you name it--regulations that comply with Federal environmental laws that are based on good science, that have taken years to prepare, and that have taken fair account of all stakeholders' input.  I cannot support a nominee to lead this Agency whose record is so hostile to the environment. For all of these reasons, I must vote no on Mr.Pruitt's nomination to be EPA  Finally, we have today the court's ordering Mr.Pruitt to release a large number of records that are relevant to this particular nomination. He has refused to release them. The administration, in vetting him, did a very poor job. As you know, they do not vet anybody. They throw it up here, and we have to do the vetting. That is our job to do the vetting. This is a critical part of the record--a vast number of emails that should be looked at.  Many of us believe we should have the time to look at these emails, to deliberate about them, to maybe even ask some written questions to Mr.Pruitt about them, but this nomination is being rammed through. In a couple of hours, we are going to have a vote. Luckily, Senator Merkley is going to urge that we vote to delay this so we can have a chance to look at those emails. It is so that all of us--all of the 100 Senators--have the opportunity to have a full, complete record on Mr. Madam President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

442,topic-id,880,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the leader for his comments and for participating tonight. I really appreciate his words and that recognition.  I want to thank everyone that is with us today to talk about our Blue Collar Caucus and jobs in this country. I think that there is nothing more important to any individual--any man or woman--than the ability to be able to have a good job, to take care of your family, and to be able to be a part of the American economy and to contribute to that economy.  I want to start off talking about President Barack Under President Barack Obama, the American economy added 9.3 million jobs and overcame one of the worst economic crises our Nation has ever seen.  In Arlington, Texas, which is part of the district that I represent in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, we have a General Motors plant. As you know, we could have lost our car industry. We have probably the most profitable plant in the General Motors family. All of the cars that you see around here at the Capitol, all of the Yukons, all of the Suburbans, the Tahoes, the Escalades, we make those in Arlington, We are very proud of our plant, very proud of the company being there all those years and for the UAW workers there that help make that plant great.  Despite the gains that we have seen with President Obama's saving the auto industry with the 9.3 million jobs and our overcoming one of the worst economic crises, again, that our country has ever seen, many workers across the U.felt that the economic recovery had left them behind. The rise of automation and outsourcing pushed many of those workers out of jobs that they absolutely loved. The frustration felt by these workers is understandable. Everyone--everyone--wants a good job that lets them, for their family, be able to take care of themselves, be able to pay their bills, send their kids to college, and buy a car.  President Trump appealed to many blue-collar workers during his campaign with a populist message and pledges to help working America, but his actions since taking office directly contradict so many of his promises. President Trump is playing one of the slickest political scams we have ever seen on hardworking American families. It is a scam. It is not real.  On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order that raised mortgage rates for new homeowners. Those same people that live in those Rust Belt States are those same individuals that were Democrats that went on television and went on social media and said they were going to give this guy a chance. What does he do on the very first day? We are going to raise interest rates on new homeowners, people trying to live the American There is nothing more that embodies the American Dream than being able to buy that first home. It was a slap in the face to those blue-collar workers and a boost to Wall  President Trump also signed an executive order that made it easier for Wall Street bankers to make money on risky bets. His Labor and his Treasury Cabinet nominees both have track records that are very unfriendly to the middle class and have no understanding what middle class workers face.  It is clear that President Trump does not have a plan to fight for the working man and woman as he promised on the campaign trail. That is why my colleagues and I--Brendan Boyle who is here with me from the State of Pennsylvania, we formed the Blue Collar Caucus to address challenges facing[[Page H1226]]blue-collar workers in today's economy. We are going to stand up to the Trump administration when he turns his back on working class  Our mission is to listen directly to middle class America's concerns and translate their needs into policies that allow them to adapt to the changing job market. We have to be able to equip our blue-collar workers with training that leads to jobs and opportunities. We just can't say ``job training.'' Those training opportunities have to lead to something of substance, which is a real job with a paycheck and some benefits.  This year alone, the U.is expected to add 2.5 million middle-skill jobs, the majority of which employers are telling me--and they have been to my office, and Mr.Boyle has probably heard the same thing. They are saying that these jobs are hard to fill. The Blue Collar Caucus is going to prioritize training and retraining initiatives to provide real opportunity and security to working class  I have a lot more to say, but I do want to turn it over to Brendan Boyle from Pennsylvania, my good friend, who also has the same passion to represent and really stand up for working class America, for blue-collar America--not just promise them things, not just get them pumped up with a bunch of hype, but to really talk about real policy initiatives that will help them be able to put some food on the table, put some money in the bank, be able to buy that first house and buy that car that they always wanted.

446,topic-id,1054,"One of the things I remember growing up in Fort Worth, Texas, was that we were blessed to have several manufacturing facilities that were union shops. We had General Dynamics, which is now Lockheed When I was growing up, it had about 30,000 employees out there.  We had Bell Helicopter, which is owned by Textron now. There are lots of employees out there. We had Miller Brewing Company, which is still there. Now it is We had several places, like General Motors, which I think I mentioned a little bit earlier.  So we had several places that had good benefit. I had family members that worked at many of those places. Good benefits, good jobs that people could really be proud of. One of the reasons why we have seen the decline of pay in this country is because of the Republicans and their efforts to undermine labor.  When you start talking about undermining labor and when you turn on these talk radio shows--you turn on The Rush Limbaugh Show, you turn on Mark Levin, you turn on these shows--they are always talking about how bad unions are in this country. But when I think about my own experience growing up in Fort Worth and I think about towns like White Settlement; towns like Benbrook; the community that I grew up in, Stop Six and Como; and I think about the middle class jobs that many of these union shops brought to all communities, again, whether it was the White community, the Hispanic community, or Black, they allowed people to be able to put some food on the table.  I have got to tell you, I was really kind of tickled and shocked at the same time by an article in the opinion section in The Wall Street Journal back on September 3, 2015. It was titled: ``The Shop Steward in the White House.'' It was taking a shot at President Obama for all of the things that he was doing for American workers, and many of the things that the Wall Street guy that wrote the article was complaining about, saying all these things about President Obama, they were all actually really good things that the President was advocating for.  My question and what I want to know and what I want Rust Belt workers and people all around the country to ask: Is this Presidency, is this administration going to embody and really embrace those same principles that were talked about for President Obama when he was really trying to protect these workers? Is this President going to do the same thing? Are his partners in the legislative branch, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Senators on the other side of the Capitol that are Republicans, are they going to also stop going after American wages, stop going after American workers and their benefits, and start standing up for these workers so they can put some more food on the table?  That is what I want to know. Those are the type of questions that we should be asking and we should be talking about.  President Trump can put out a statement on this right now if he wanted to, but obviously he has a lot of other things going on.  The Davis-Bacon Act, as many of us know, is the rule that ensures all Federal contractors are paid a fair wage while they are working on public works projects.  If there was ever a repeal of Davis-Bacon, we would see a decrease in the quality of blue-collar jobs, and we can absolutely not afford that. Stagnating wages, like I talked a little bit about earlier, has left workers unable to care for their families. As a result, one-third of blue-collar families are enrolled in one or more social safety net program.  That is not what blue-collar workers want. They want the ability to be able to take care of their own families. They don't want these social safety net programs. They want to be providers and be proud of their jobs.  The Blue Collar Caucus intends to defend the Davis-Bacon Act and fight any attempts to decrease wages for America's already struggling working class. We know that we can build an economy that works for everybody if we just work together. So work with us as we stand against President Trump's unfulfilled promises and stand up for these blue-collar workers. That is what we want our friends on the other side of the aisle to do.  But what I would really like to see right now, even before President Trump reaches out to, again, his Republican friends in the legislative branch, is for him to come out and make a statement for these blue-collar workers, for these people in the Rust Belt, for these people in the South, for these people in Dallas-Fort Worth, and all over the country. I want him to come out and make a statement on where he stands on Davis-                             {time}  1800  It is one thing to just talk in broad categories about bringing jobs back to[[Page H1228]]our country, stopping our jobs from going overseas. This is an actual policy that we know has been good for many workers in Mr.Boyle's district and in mine and, again, everywhere. Where is the President on this issue? Why is he not saying anything about Davis-Bacon? I want to hear what he has to say. I know that Mr.Boyle knows about just how important things like Davis-Bacon are and other issue areas are.  Another area is the Supreme Court nominee, Mr.Where is he going to rule when it comes to working families? That is what I want to know. That is the type of thing that I hope that people on the factory floors and shops across this country start talking about is how is this man going to rule? We already know that he has made several bad rulings as it relates to working families, rulings that will directly affect how big their paychecks are, literally has made rulings that have taken money right out of their pockets, right out of their bank accounts. Those are the types of things that we need to be talking about, not all this 35,000-feet-up-in-the-air-type stuff, but actual policy details that we know can impact and hurt families.

447,topic-id,626,"When I am back in the district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area--and Dallas and Fort Worth are the two most recognizable cities that I represent in the district, but there are other cities. We have Irving that is there, we have Grand Prairie, we have Arlington where the Cowboys stadium is located, and a lot of people are asking: When are we going to get these good jobs back? We want to see some of these good jobs come back. I have got to tell you, the President made a lot of promises when he was on the campaign trail about bringing some of these jobs back, and I want to see those jobs come back, too.  I think that with everything going on right now, with the resignation of General Flynn and there being so much talk about campaign operatives on the Trump campaign talking to Russian intelligence officials, I think that he is going to be too distracted to help these workers. I think that Republicans are going to be too distracted to help these workers in the Rust Belt, to help these middle class, these blue-collar workers.  I have got to tell you, during our retreat last week while we were in Baltimore, I opened up The Wall Street Journal first thing in the morning. I saw this article about how--and it was about jobs still pouring in to Mexico, and it was really one of the saddest things that I ever read. For some manufacturers, Mexico is still the best move. They specifically were talking about a corporation called the Rexnord  It really broke my heart when I was reading the articles about how they were asking the workers at this plant[[Page H1229]]in America, in our country, to actually train individuals from foreign countries to replace them. They wanted them to train them for the jobs that they currently had here in our country and asking them to, you know, train these people so we can ship your job out of the country and you can be replaced. How demoralizing to go to work knowing that you are training someone next to you for your job to be sent overseas or sent out of the country, your livelihood, everything that you have known. For a lot of these little, small towns, these companies really are the face of the town.  In Texas, and I am sure it is like this in Indiana and in other parts of the Rust Belt and other parts of blue-collar America, Friday night football is a really big deal, maybe the local high school basketball game is a really big deal, but also that ranks right up there with both of those two athletic activities in these towns, their identity is driven by their job. I thought that was such a sad commentary about where we are now.  Again, with all of the executive orders, when you start talking about the travel ban on citizens from Muslim countries, when you start talking about the executive order to raise interest rates on first-time homeowners, no executive orders whatsoever to protect the American worker. We are a month into the administration. No executive order, no action, no comments on Davis-Bacon, nothing to reinforce the fact that we are with these guys, and it is really sad.  I am sure that these workers out there, in America, in New Jersey, in other States, I bet you they are sitting back watching, saying: How in the world is this President going to help us with all of the distractions that are going on over there? When is he going to help us? He has done all these other things with the executive order, why not do something for the American worker?

I thank him for telling us about his journey, employment, and how much electricians mean to this country, and other people that work with their hands.  I think it is sad that in a lot of our public schools that type of work has[[Page H1230]]been--quite frankly, there is no other way to say it--some of it has been put down. But those workers are important. We need to stop having people rank jobs and make sure that we know that all jobs in this country are important.  Since 2000, the United States has lost about 4.8 million manufacturing jobs. That is a 29 percent decrease in jobs for blue-collar workers. Again, manufacturing jobs are good-paying jobs. Manufacturing jobs pay about 20 percent higher than service jobs do. So any manufacturing job that we lose in this country is bad.  One of the saddest stories--and there are so many sad stories about these plants that have closed down, and so much of the focus has been on the Rust Belt, and rightfully so. And Marcy Kaptur may tell me if I am pronouncing the name of this city correctly.

Maybe Granddaddy worked at the school and Grandmother worked at someone's house or maybe they were fortunate enough to have two good labor jobs where they made union wages, but it laid that groundwork for the foundation that we have today.  King was obviously a big part of that. Sadly, on April 4, 1968, he paid his life supporting the sanitation workers in Memphis, trying to push for them to have better wages.  When King died, it wasn't about trying to open up a restaurant to make sure that all people had access to that restaurant or some other place, to make sure that people could ride on the bus; it was to make sure that people had equal opportunity in this country, again, equal opportunity for upward mobility, equal opportunity to be able to take care of their families. I just really appreciate everything that he did.  We need to continue to mobilize and organize grassroots efforts around the income inequality in this country. The income inequality that we have in this country is very, very real.  You see productivity rising in our country. You see companies recording record productivity, but wages are stagnant. There used to be a time in this country that wages would go up when productivity of companies went up, and we are not seeing that anymore. I think that is really, really sad. We need to organize around that because all people need the opportunity[[Page H1347]]to be able to advance as the country advances and as industry advances. I think that that is a big part of that.  Again, I thank all our colleagues that have come here tonight to organize, to carry the torch. We need to continue to find different ways that we can use grassroots movements in this country, not just looking back and reflecting on previous grassroots and events, but how we can learn from that history and how we can mobilize people today to better America, to better wages for all communities, for the African-American community, of course, as we celebrate and come toward the end of Black History Month, but Latino communities, White communities, people in the Rust Belt, and African-American communities in places like Gary, Indiana, that really saw their fortunes hurt more than many other parts of the country.

358,topic-id,566,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise today in strong support of H.66, a resolution to protect retirement savers.  During the final days of the Obama administration--in fact, the final hours--the Department of Labor created a regulatory loophole that threatens the retirement security of working families. We are here today to use Congress' authority under the Congressional Review Act to close that loophole by blocking a misguided regulation from taking effect.  The regulation paves the way for States to force certain employers to automatically enroll their employees into government States would be allowed to skirt Federal law and deny workers important protections designed to safeguard their retirement savings.  The Obama administration's action is somewhat perplexing. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, has enjoyed strong bipartisan support for decades. As President Ford said when he signed the law, the American people have ``greater assurances that retirement dollars will be there when they are needed.'' Yet, over 40 years later, the same administration that frequently touted the importance of consumer protections moved to exempt States from                              {time}  1430  The question is why. To facilitate the creation of government-run plans that[[Page H1210]]would lack basic protections for retirement savers? As a result, workers and retirees would have nowhere to turn if their savings were mismanaged.  Let's be honest about what this regulation is really about. It is part of an assault on small business retirement plans that began under the Obama administration. First, small businesses were hit by the fiduciary rule that would make it harder for them to access the financial advice they need to set up retirement plans for their employees. Then the Obama administration created a last-minute regulatory loophole that could discourage small businesses from offering retirement plans in the first place. As a result, many families could soon realize, If you like your 401(k) plan, you may not be able to keep it.  Because of this loophole, taxpayers also are at risk. Many of the States leading the charge on these government-run plans have a long history of mismanaging public employee pensions. Today there is an estimated $5 trillion in unfunded State pension promises--$5 trillion. That figure is completely unsustainable. It begs the question: Will taxpayers or retirement savers foot the bill if these government-run IRAs are similarly mismanaged?  However, we are not here today to debate the merits of State policy. To be clear, States should be free to experiment with new retirement options, and more options are certainly needed. It is up to the voters in each State to hold their elected officials accountable. The point of this debate is that States should not be exempt from a law that has, for decades, provided important protections for retirement savers. If States want to come up with new ways to help workers save for retirement, they can. But they should follow the law in the process.  The goal of this resolution is simple. It is to uphold protections Congress--including Members of both parties--have long afforded retirement savers. Today we can close a regulatory loophole that would be detrimental to the retirement security of hardworking Americans, and we can ensure retirement savers in every State continue to have the same protections under Federal law. I urge my colleagues to support strong protections for retirement savers by voting in favor of H.66.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

February 13, 2017.       To the Members of the United States Congress: The      undersigned organizations, representing thousands of      businesses, express our support for H.66 and H.     67, resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional      Review Act (``CRA'') to invalidate the Department of Labor's      (``DOL'') ``safe harbor'' regulations on Savings Arrangements      Established by State and Political Subdivisions for Non-     Governmental       These ``safe harbor'' regulations allow states and cities      to mandate private employer participation in state-sponsored      automatic IRA programs. It also provides that states that      offer these programs are not subject to ERISA despite      considerable opinions to the contrary. Thus the DOL is      encouraging state and local governments to provide private      sector employees retirement programs that do not have the      same high-level protections as other private employer-     sponsored plans.       Below we highlight a number of our concerns with the ``safe      harbor.''       Lost worker protections--States offering these plans to      private sector employees are not subject to ERISA, therefore      limiting the protections for workers in these plans.       Different standards from state to state result in an      administrative quagmire for employers--States can and will      have different rules for their programs, so employers      operating in multiple states, or just with workers from      multiple states, will have to track the complex web of      varying rules to ensure compliance.       Fewer employer plans, especially among small businesses--If      a state mandates auto-IRAs, some employers will decide to      avoid taking on the work of offering their own plans and let      the state take it on instead, resulting in the loss of      significant retirement savings opportunities for their      workers.       Mismanagement of state pension funds--Many states have      mismanaged their public employee retirement systems, and it's      not clear they'll do a better job controlling assets of      millions of small private sector savers. Also, some state      pension funds restrict investments to favor state initiatives      or engage in politically motivated investment and divestment      schemes instead of investing in the economic interest of the      workers.       Imposes a mandate on private employers--The ``safe harbor''      requires that the state program mandate employer      participation even though retirement savings plans are      traditionally voluntary.       We urge Congress to take timely action under the CRA to      vitiate these misguided regulations. We thank you for      addressing this important issue.

I want to elaborate a little bit on what my friend and colleague from Portland talked about. It was more than just a camping trip. It was 3 nights with backpacks, 4 days, 41 miles, and 9,000 feet of gain and loss in elevation. We went all the way around Hood, which is an extraordinary piece of Oregon, and we had a wonderful time.  Along the way, we had our ornithologist there; we had geologists there; we had biologists; we had advocates for wilderness and advocates for recreation. We were met by, I think it was, the Mazamas with watermelons. One afternoon, they hiked them up I don't know how many thousand feet to share with us. It was really a kind of Oregon-way experience, because we all care deeply about the watersheds, the jobs, the recreation, the beauty, the incredible piece of the world we live in around  It is my home area. I grew up around the Hood This land exchange has been a battle since the 1970s, in a sense, in that my community long ago said: We don't want a lot of development up in this Crystal Springs watershed and in this very pristine area around the Hood River upper valley. It really belongs around the corner of Hood, up in Government Camp where there already is development.  This fight has gone on for years; and all sides came together, as we did in our legislation, and said: We agree. And so we said: Fine, we will put that in the bill. They worked it out with the Forest Service and everybody else, and then we said: They have done the heavy lift for the last, I don't know, 30 years. Forest Service, you just make this transfer and do it in 16 months. That is what the law said.  We are nearly 8 years later and this is still languishing; and, unfortunately, we are back trying again, because we are never going to quit until we are done. We are getting much closer.  In fact, the law we passed back in 2009, Public Law 111-11, deals with this Public Lands It said: ``Deadline for completion of land exchange. It is the intent of the Congress that the land exchange under this subsection shall be completed not later than 16 months after the date of enactment of this Act.''  Again, that was back in 2009. It is important to protect this watershed. It is important that where development occurs, it occurs in the right places.

Five years ago, Congress passed a bipartisan law that included a commonsense provision giving the States flexibility to drug test some applicants for unemployment insurance.  Instead of following the law Congress passed and allowing--not requiring--States to implement the policies right for their citizens, the Obama administration decided to tie States' hands. It issued a regulation that left no flexibility for States, the opposite of the bipartisan law Congress passed.  Mr.Speaker, frankly, it is sad that we are even here today.

This resolution will overturn an Obama administration rule that forces States to direct Federal funds to abortion providers like Planned  States receive Federal funding to support family planning services, and they have the discretion to distribute these title X funds in the way that best serves their communities. Many States have exercised their discretion to direct title X funding to community health centers and family health clinics that do not provide abortions and withhold funding from abortion providers like Planned  It is just common sense that States know the needs of their people and their communities better than Washington bureaucrats do. The States should be able to decide how these Federal funds are distributed.  Unfortunately, the Obama administration disagreed, so they issued a last-minute regulation in their final days in office that would force States to distribute funding to abortion providers. Their rule would take away States' abilities to direct title X funds to providers that offer comprehensive care but do not participate in abortion. It would force States to enable the flow of funds to Planned Parenthood and others in the abortion industry. I think it is reprehensible.  Now Congress has the opportunity to right this wrong and undo the massive overreach. We are taking action to defend taxpayers and defend life by using the Congressional Review Act to overturn this rule. Overturning this rule won't reduce funding for women's health care.

562,topic-id,5430,"Mr.President, on December 8, Donald Trump nominated Andrew Puzder to serve as Secretary of He was scheduled to come before the HELP Committee tomorrow for his confirmation hearing. There is some reporting suggesting that he is having some second thoughts, and I sincerely hope that is true. The reasons Mr.Puzder is a terrible choice for this job are literally too numerous to cover fully, but I will at least give it a start.  If you work for a living, the Labor Secretary is very important to you. This person is responsible for protecting the interests of 150 million American workers. He will be the person responsible for enforcing the law that ensures that employers actually pay workers for every hour they work and setting the standards to prevent workplace injuries and even deaths.  Unfortunately, Mr.Puzder is not the kind of person the American people can trust to stand up for workers. Since 2000, Mr.Puzder has served as the CEO of the billion-dollar company CKE Restaurant You may know it better as the parent company of Carl's and Hardee's. These two fast-food chains are known for paying very low wages to workers. Mr.Puzder has a long record of cheating workers out of overtime. He has paid out millions of dollars to settle claims when he was caught cheating. We are not talking about isolated incidents. They reflect the kind of business Mr.Puzder built. Mr.Puzder is a frequent political pundit and commentator who has vocally opposed higher minimum wages. He has also strongly opposed new overtime protections that would give 4 million workers an estimated $1.5 billion raise in a single year.  Mr.Puzder also delights in expressing personal disdain for his workers. He bragged in his very first memo as He wrote that he wanted ``no more people behind the counter unless they have their teeth.'' Ha, ha. He said he would like to replace his workers with robots because ``they are always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex or discrimination case.''  The Senate has an obligation to hear from those who are best qualified to[[Page S1180]]tell America about Mr.Puzder's suitability to be Labor Secretary and to stand up for American workers--his own workers. That is why many of us asked the chairman of the HELP Committee to include Mr.Puzder's workers in his confirmation hearing. When the chairman refused to do so, we just went ahead and convened our own forum to allow those workers a chance to speak.  Seventeen Senators attended. Those 17 Senators heard from Laura McDonald, who worked as a general manager at Carl's in Tucson, AZ, for 20 years. For years, she was forced to work extra hours without pay. Employees like Laura are the subject of a major lawsuit against Mr.Puzder's company, CKE, regarding unpaid overtime.  Those 17 Senators heard from Lupe Guzman, who is a single mother who has devoted the last 7 years of her life to Carl's in Las Vegas, She has worked the graveyard shift for rock bottom wages. Seven years of loyalty, and Lupe is still paid so little that she is on food stamps to feed her kids. Lupe sat in front of the U.Senate and wept openly about her terrible treatment at the hands of Mr.Puzder's company.  The Senators also heard from Roberto Ramirez, who has worked in the fast food industry for over 20 years, mostly at Carl's in Los Angeles, He worked regularly off the clock at Carl's Jr., meaning they didn't pay him. Roberto even had a full paycheck stolen by his manager.  For every Laura, Lupe, and Roberto, we found dozens of workers who were afraid to speak out about the terrible conditions at We compiled some stories from folks brave enough to speak up into a 20-page report detailing firsthand accounts of the men and women who work for Mr.Those stories are horrifying, and I will read some of them later today.  Mr.Puzder's company has a truly atrocious record of treating his own workers terribly. Indeed, he has dripping disdain for people who work for a living. This alone disqualifies him to be Secretary of  But there is more. In recent weeks, it has come out that Mr.Puzder employed an undocumented immigrant in his household for years, and he didn't pay taxes on that employee. Yep, you heard that correctly. The Trump administration, which bellows about building a wall and pounds its chest about ripping millions of families apart with a deportation force, threatens millions of DREAM Act kids with deportation, has no problem putting a guy in charge of the Labor Department who cheats on his taxes and employs undocumented workers. The hypocrisy of that is pretty stunning, even for the Trump administration.  And then there is the controversy over alleged spousal abuse. Over 25 years ago, Mr.Puzder's first wife appeared on an episode of Oprah Winfrey in a show about spousal abuse. I have watched the episode in which she appeared, as I believe every Senator should. I found it extraordinarily troubling.  Alongside his company's poor record of treatment of female employees, his highly explicit and sexualized ads, and his snide comments about sex discrimination, there is ample evidence that Mr.Puzder is a terrible choice to head the agency charged with ensuring that women and men are treated fairly in the workplace.  I understand that no matter who President Trump picks to run the Labor Department, I am probably going to have a lot of issues with that person, but this is different. Andrew Puzder should not be the Labor And if you ask the Senators in this body--Republicans and Democrats--if you ask them behind closed doors with the cameras turned off, you will have a hard time finding people who think this divisive nomination is good for the country.  It has been suggested that Mr.Puzder is ``tired of the abuse'' that he has received during this confirmation process. Well, I think the workers at his companies are pretty tired of the abuse they have received while being at the mercy of an employer who doesn't care about them at all and who goes out of his way to squeeze them out of every last dime. That is literally the opposite of what we need in a Labor  I was prepared to question him on these issues tomorrow, but I hope it is true that he will withdraw his nomination before then.  Mr.President, I also rise today to express many concerns over the appointment of Congressman Mulvaney as Director of the Office of Management and Budget and to urge my colleagues to seriously consider these issues before voting to confirm him.  One of the best ways to understand what a nation stands for is to look at its budget. It is all right there. The budget tells who counts, it tells who gets a chance, and it tells who gets cast aside.  The OMB Director prepares the President's budget. He safeguards the President's promises by turning them into real commitments backed by your tax dollars.  During the campaign, President Trump promised over and over again that he would protect Medicare and He didn't imply it; he didn't drop hints about it. No, he made the clearest, plainest possible promise. He said: ``I am not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.''  But since the election, he has done a complete 180. He put up a transition team website that just dripped with code words for cuts, saying that he would modernize and maximize flexibility for these programs. Gone were the unambiguous promises to protect Medicare and  Then he started nominating people who have made it their life's work to gut Medicare and His Secretary of Health and Human Services has proposed cutting more than $1 trillion from these programs, and now his nominee for OMB Director is someone who wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid to the bone.  Congressman Mulvaney has voted to increase the retirement age for Hey, you have paid into that program with decades of hard work? Too bad, just keep waiting.  He also wants to privatize Medicare, and he wants to slash and burn his way through Medicaid--a program that is a lifeline for millions of people--for parents of people in nursing homes, for people with disabilities, for premature babies.  In his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney was asked whether he would set aside his rightwing ideology to fulfill the President's campaign promises to protect Medicare and The Congressman could not have been clearer in his response: Forget all of that. Nope, not interested. Mulvaney is still a true believer in Medicare and Medicaid cuts, and whenever he has the President's ear, he will continue to advance his own radical ideas for burning down these indispensable programs.  President Trump also promised that he would not cut Social He guaranteed it. Here is his quote--many times: ``We're going to save your Social Security without making any cuts,'' he said.  Here was his closer on that: ``Mark my words.''  Nice words. But he could have picked someone--anyone--to run his budget, and instead he picked Congressman Mulvaney--one of Congress's most partisan crusaders against the Social Security program. He wants to raise the retirement age to 70. Heck, this is a person who calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme, and, boy, he is not messing around, either.  During his confirmation hearings, Congressman Mulvaney doubled down on his promise to rob American workers and retirees by gutting Social When pressed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham about whether he would urge President Trump to reconsider his promise not to cut Social Security, hey, Mulvaney said that he absolutely would.  Is this just a mistake? Did President Trump just pick Congressman Mulvaney by accident? The Congressman certainly doesn't seem to think so.  At his hearing he said: ``I have to imagine that the President knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill that role.''  Yes, Mulvaney himself believes he is being brought in to push for cuts in Medicare and  Trump reverses his promise, a second person determined to cut Medicare and Medicaid makes it into a key government role, and who will pay the price? America's seniors, that is who.  Apparently, Congressman Mulvaney isn't satisfied with cutting benefits for[[Page S1181]]Americans who have worked and paid into the program for their entire lives. When it comes to abandoning American workers and families, for him, that is just the beginning.  He has also called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ``a sick, sad joke.'' Maybe he should spend a little more time talking to his constituents and a little less time talking to bank lobbyists.  The CFPB has helped thousands of people in every State--including dozens of people in Congressman Mulvaney's own district--recover unauthorized fees on their credit cards and checking accounts. It has helped them to correct errors on their credit reports. These are students, seniors, servicemembers, and veterans, who may have spent months haggling with their bank or student loan servicer over a wrong charge, only to get quick and complete relief after they went to the Consumer Financial Protection  In total--the agency has only been up for about 5\1/2\ years now--it has forced the largest banks across this country, many of those who have been out there cheating consumers, to return nearly $12 billion directly to the people they cheated. That is $12 billion that was stolen by big banks, by payday lenders, by debt collectors, and is now back in the pockets of the people who rightfully earned it.  The only sick, sad joke is that Congressman Mulvaney thinks we should turn the big banks loose to prey on American families once again.  Under Congressman Mulvaney's budget, Americans who have been cheated and scammed by huge financial institutions will just be cast aside. Families who work hard for every dollar, only to have some ruthless corporation steal their savings right out from underneath them, will be cast aside. And the millions of Americans who have worked for decades planning to collect Social Security or Medicare when they retire will be told to just wait four more years. They will be thrown straight to the curb. None of that--none of that--is what America stands for.  That is just the stuff that directly contradicts the President's campaign promises. The stuff that is totally in line with the President's campaign promises is genuinely scary too.  On the campaign trail, Donald Trump stated that he ``may cut the Department of Education.'' Will Congressman Mulvaney stand up for students?  Congressman Mulvaney's record shows that he is fine building a Federal budget that crushes students who are trying to get a college education. Students already pay too much for student loans, and Congressman Mulvaney's solution is to force students to pay more. He supports forcing more college students to borrow more money from private banks that charge sky-high interest rates without any of the basic protections Federal student loans have. He clearly wants to let private banks and Wall Street squeeze as much cash out of hard-working students as humanly possible to build their profits. In fact, Congressman Mulvaney wants to help these giant banks out even more by taking a sledgehammer to the Federal student loan program and making Federal loan terms lousy for students. That is why he repeatedly voted to eliminate subsidized student loans for low-income students and why he helped block legislation to allow borrowers to lower their monthly payments by refinancing their student loans to lower interest rates. Not only has he voted to increase the interest rates the government charges students, he has also voted to cut Pell grants to poor college students. If Congressman Mulvaney had his way, millions more hard-working students would be shoved even deeper into debt at the start of their working lives just because they couldn't afford the high cost of college. Under his budget, students will just be cast aside.  In his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney also said he is ``in lockstep'' with Donald Trump's plans to grow military spending, but he said he would pay for that increase in funding with deep cuts to domestic programs that working men and women around the country depend on--programs that could easily include Head Start, which provides opportunities for low-income children; the disaster aid, which supports families in crisis after a hurricane or tornado; or resiliency programs to protect America as worldwide climate changes.  Listen to that again. The children who attend Head Start can stay home so Donald Trump can divert more money to military spending. The people who get buried in a 100-year snowstorm can stay buried so Donald Trump can divert more money to military spending. The people who live near coasts and rivers and streams can be washed away by rising oceans and other waterways so Donald Trump can divert money to military spending--and this nominee, Congressman Mulvaney, is in lockstep to make it happen.  Under President Trump's new one-in, two-out Executive order, it is Mr.Mulvaney who would have discretion to give each agency a regulatory budget and to approve any proposed regulations that increase that budget. The order is supposedly designed to make life easier and to make government work better, but Congressman Mulvaney isn't interested in making government work better, and he is certainly not interested in making life easier. In fact, he has spent his entire political career working to cripple the agencies that protect American families--American workers, American consumers, and American small businesses. Nowhere is this clearer than in his attacks on the Federal agencies that protect consumers, that preserve our environment, and that help keep our country safe. He has worked to starve agencies of the resources they need to do their jobs, voting to cut funding to law enforcement, voting to gut the Social Security Program, and voting to completely defund the organization that provides critical legal services to low-income American children, families, seniors, and veterans.  But it is not enough for him to starve agencies to the breaking point. He has also supported radical bills to stop agencies from issuing regulations that keep our air clean, our food safe, and our economy from suffering another devastating financial crisis. Congressman Mulvaney wants to require agencies to adopt a bill that imposes the least costs on big businesses, even when those costs are about making sure companies don't cut corners by cheating, poisoning, and killing people. Look, if it is cheaper for a corporation to kill you than it is for the corporation to redesign the product or clean up their mess, Congressman Mulvaney stands with the corporation. I am sure he would be willing to say something nice at your funeral about how your contribution helped give the corporation record profits.  If all that wasn't bad enough, Congressman Mulvaney is ready to rock and roll on secret money in politics. Washington is already awash in dark money, but that is not enough for Congressman He has worked to open the doors even wider to secret spending in politics. Over and over, he has voted to shield the identity of political donors, keep them secret. For example, he opposed a rule that required corporations applying for government contracts to disclose their political contributions. Again, just think about that one for a minute. He doesn't want corporations that bid for government contracts to be forced to tell when they give money to help targeted government officials. We already have a problem with money in politics. Mulvaney just wants to make it worse.  Congressman Mulvaney's record shows one thing. He will make sure our Federal Government works well for giant corporations and billionaires who don't like to play by the rules, and he will cast aside the rest of the public to do that. That is definitely not what our Nation stands for.  I understand Democrats and Republicans have different priorities when it comes to the Federal budget. I get that, but when one person wants to slash Social Security for American retirees, to cut Medicare for senior citizens, to gut health benefits for low-income families, to drive up the cost of paying for college, and to gut programs that help families in crisis and low-income children, all in the name of making life even easier for giant corporations and billionaires--well, I think it is clear that his priorities do not include the safety and security of millions of That is a priority that should be at the top of all of our[[Page S1182]]lists in the Senate, Republican and  I will stand with the Americans whom Congressman Mulvaney will cast aside as Budget Director, and I will vote no on his nomination.  Mick Mulvaney wants to slash benefits under Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and countless other programs. These are just numbers to him, but behind those numbers are real people. Real lives are at risk with every decision he will make as the Budget So what I want to do is take the time I have remaining and share the stories of just a few of the people who would be affected.  Lea from Plymouth wrote to me, worried that Congressman Mulvaney would cut Social Security for her and for others in Lea had an interesting suggestion. Here is what she wrote:       I have just sent off an email message to Representative      Mulvaney regarding his spearheading of the cutting of Social      Security benefits.       I challenged him and many of his colleagues to do this:      Live on an income like mine--of $1,219.80--for one month.       Having received my first increase of $2.50 in several      years, it was offset by a Medicare cost increase of $11.50.      Do the math.       I hope you and the other Democratic members of both houses      fight like hell to raise our benefits.       We are definitely in for a bumpy ride for the next 4 years.      As the saying goes . . . ``it ain't going to be pretty!''       Thank you for listening.  Thank you, Thank you for writing.  I also heard from Janneke from Williamstown, who is worried about several nominees working to cut Social Here is what Janneke had to say:       It is terrifying to consider either of these nominees,      Price or Mulvaney, being confirmed for the position to which      they have been nominated. They will work to undo, not to      strengthen, social security. This is a profoundly disturbing      possibility.       I urge you to do everything you can to oppose their      confirmation!  Thank you, I will. I will keep fighting for your hard-earned benefits.  Janet from Florence also reached out to me. She shared the inspiring stories of her and her husband, and then she told me how worried she is that cuts to Social Security and Medicare could be coming under Congressman Mulvaney's watch. Here is what she wrote:       I am 60 years old and have always been employed--in higher      education jobs where I worked hard and long for modest wages,      frequently the case in women-dominated professions.       My husband is a childcare worker who works with infants and      toddlers. The work we do is meaningful and makes a societal      contribution.       At 60 and 64, we have always lived like graduate students.      We shop at the Goodwill, cook from scratch, bring our lunch,      and drive old cars--and bike and walk. We will each be      working until age 70, or longer, if our health permits. This      is fine. We are fortunate to live as we do. But with market-     based retirement funds and with family members needing our      support, we need Social Security, which is NOT BROKEN, to      remain, and be strengthened. And we need access to health      care, for ourselves, children, and grandchildren.       This is a plea from the fading middle class to oppose the      Price and Mulvaney nominations. We--and people far less      fortunate than we are--need your stout support.  Thank you, Thank you and your husband for all you do for your community. I promise I will do my best to protect your benefits.  I have received hundreds of these types of letters--letters from constituents who are scared that cuts to Medicaid and Medicare could endanger their basic ability to survive, letters from constituents who have seen how important these services are to thousands across the State and millions across the country, constituents who aren't sure where to turn and whom to blame. They just know they cannot afford to lose these benefits, like a woman from Somerville, who wrote to me about the work she does as an intensive care coordinator. Here is what she had to say:       I am an Intensive Care Coordinator through Riverside      Community Care, a statewide human service agency that      delivers crucial mental health services to at-risk youth. In      my program, the Guidance Center Community Service Agency, we      specifically provide Child Behavioral Health Initiatives      (CBHI) services to youth in Cambridge, Somerville, Medford,      Malden, Waltham, Woburn, Wilmington, and other northern      towns.       I am extremely nervous that the new presidential      administration will attack Medicaid and put our programs in      jeopardy.       If you're not familiar with the CBHI wraparound model, I      can briefly explain why these services are so important. One:      we serve youth in poverty. Two: our services are community      based, so we go to the homes of the families we're serving,      so they don't need to rely on transportation. Three: we are a      form of outpatient care that prevents youth who are suicidal/     homicidal from needing hospitalization. Or, if they are      hospitalized, helping the family develop a plan for when      they're discharged. Four: Although the child with mental      health diagnosis is our identified client, the services      benefit the whole family. We understand that taking care of      children with special needs is taxing, so we identify      resources and services for parents as well. Five: we work      with state departments like Department of Children and      Families, Department of Health, and Department of      Developmental Six: our model works. I myself      rarely close a case without having had at least one goal      (identified by the family) met and there are growing      statistics about the benefit of having us in place.       I hope you can bring this argument where it needs to go to      ensure that we have a future here in  I want to say on this one: Thank you. Thank you for writing, and thank you for the work you do.  I am doing my best to bring this story. This is a story everybody in the Senate should listen to. It is a story about how we reach out to those who most need us and provide the kind of care they need.  Thank you. Thank you for your work, and thank you for writing.  I also received a letter from an occupational therapist from She told me all about the important work she has been doing and how Medicaid has been crucial to that work. Here is what she had to say:       As a constituent and occupational therapy practitioner, I      am writing to you to express my concerns about a major      restructuring of the Medicaid program.       Medicaid is an essential safety net program for the most      vulnerable in our society. In 2015, 39% of children received      health insurance either through the Childrens Health      Insurance Program or through More than 60 percent      of nursing home residents are supported primarily through      Additionally, Medicaid provides health care      services and long-term services and supports to more than 10      million people living with disabilities, and 1 in 5 Medicaid      recipients receive behavioral health services.       Restructuring of the Medicaid program through per capita      caps or block granting and significant cuts to the Medicaid      program would jeopardize the long-term health and      independence of current Medicaid beneficiaries. Thus I urge      extreme care and caution when considering a major      restructuring of the program or other significant changes,      waiver of mandatory services, or dramatic cuts.  Thank you for all the work you do, and thank you for writing and making this important point about who uses Medicaid and how critical it is to the basic support services that we provide.  Another constituent wrote to me about the amazing work that she does in the Boston area for those with severe mental illness and how Medicaid and Medicare help these people. Here is what she had to say:       I work with people with severe Mental Illness in the      greater Boston area. A majority of my patients receive their      therapy and medication through Medicaid and Even      the thought of losing coverage heightens their anxiety. If      coverage is reduced or co-pays raised, they stand to lose not      only therapy and group interventions but also the medication      which is essential to avoiding higher levels of care. Given      the high rate of co-occurring physical and mental health      issues, the general health of my patients will be severely      compromised with any reduction in access to care.       Nearly 1 out of 3 people covered by Medicaid expansion live      with a mental health or substance use condition and people      with marketplace insurance plans have fair and equal mental      health coverage. With this coverage, people have access to      mental health services that support recovery.       As a constituent, I would like you to keep in mind that      Medicaid or insurance marketplace plans are helping all of      those who struggle with mental illness who, with accessible      supports, can lead healthier lives.  Again, thank you for the work you do, and thank you for writing. It is a powerfully important point.  Congressman Mulvaney wants to slash these programs. That is why I will be voting against his nomination.  I also received more personal stories from people like Michael from Acton, who told me about his son. Here is what he wrote:       My particular concern is the attack on the ACA and Medicaid      and       My biggest worry is my 27 year old son, Adam, who was born      with microcephaly. He[[Page S1183]]     is a very loving person with a great smile, but functions      roughly at the level of a 12 month old. He currently lives in      a group residence and goes to a day habilitation program      during the week. Both of these programs are funded in part by      If Medicaid funds are cut, I worry that the day-hab      program will not be able to continue or, at the least, will      operate at a much reduced level. This would seriously degrade      the quality of Adam's life. I worry what will happen at his      already understaffed residence.       As it is, the staff at Adam's residence and day-     habilitation programs are paid very little wages to do very      tough jobs. Because of this, there is already a constant      problem of finding enough people to staff these. . . . jobs      if they are paid less or have to do even more work because of      lower staffing levels[.]       The prospect of what is coming scares me. What will my      son's life be like?  Thank you for writing, I appreciate it. I will be out there fighting for I hope we can get a lot of people in the Senate to do that as well. Thank you.  We also heard from Daniel Mumbauer, who is president of the High Point Treatment Center in Daniel has experienced firsthand how Medicaid funds can change the lives of thousands of people in Massachusetts alone. This is what Daniel wrote:       On behalf of High Point Treatment Center, I am writing to      urge and request your support in protecting the Affordable      Care Act and preserving Medicaid expansion in the 115th            High Point served over 30,000 individuals last year. We      provide substance use disorder and mental health services to      adolescents and adults.       Recent health insurance data show that Americans with      mental health and substance use disorders are the single      largest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid      expansion. Nearly one in three who receives health insurance      coverage through Medicaid expansion either has a mental      illness, a substance abuse disorder, or both. By repealing      the Medicaid expansion, this population of vulnerable      Americans would be left without access to lifesaving      treatment, driving up costs in emergency department visits      and hospital stays.       I am also writing to urge your support for the protection      of the Medicaid program from proposals to restructure      Medicaid as a block grant or capped program. These proposals      would reduce federal investment in Medicaid and leave      millions of Americans without access to needed mental health      and addictions treatment in our communities. Please work with      your colleagues to protect our nation's most vulnerable      patient population and preserve their access to treatment.  Thank you, Thank you very much for writing, and thank you for the work you do.  Congressman Mulvaney wants to eviscerate health programs that would help Michael's son and the thousands who are treated at the High Point Treatment That is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.  I have also heard from many constituents worried about losing their Social Security benefits under the new administration, like Kensington from Hatfield, who is terrified that his mother, who depends on Social Security, will lose her benefits. Here is what he wrote:       Last night scared me for the first time. My mother is 69      and depends on Social Security for her income and has severe      COPD and relies on medicare and medicaid for prescriptions      and medical supplies to help her breath[e]. She was crying      and is afraid of losing everything and that she will die. I      know it's extreme thinking, but without her medicine and      income it is unfortunately the truth. I didn't know what to      say to comfort her and that scared me! What can I say to ease      her mind and let her know that she will be Will she be      OK?  Thank you, Kensington, for your note. Your mother is right to be worried, and that is why I am fighting this nomination.  I have so many more stories--many, many stories--that I could read, but I am running out of time here.  I want to say that Mick Mulvaney is dangerous to the American people, and he is dangerous to the Federal He will slash programs right and left without worrying about the living, breathing people whom he is hurting in the process. That is why I will be voting against his nomination as Director of the Office of Management and Budget and why I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Let's make sure that Mick Mulvaney never ends up as the head of the Office of Management and Budget, never is in a position to put together a budget to cut Medicare and cut Let's make sure that we keep our government, our Medicare, our Medicaid, and our Affordable Care Act working for the American people. That is what I will keep fighting for.  Mr.President, I yield.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Toomey).

995,topic-id,3762,"Mr.President, I rise to express my strong opposition to President Trump's nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator for the Environmental Protection  The reason is simple. In a choice between corporate polluters and people who want to breathe air and drink water, Scott Pruitt sides with the corporate polluters. He has no business being the head of the  During his nomination hearing, Mr.Pruitt had countless opportunities to answer for his record. His responses were flippant, evasive, and outright misleading. He has been asked repeatedly to provide records from his office concerning dealings with big oil companies, but he told the Senators that, hey, they should submit an open records request, hoping that his confirmation would be over long before those documents would see the light of day.  Just a few hours ago, an Oklahoma district court judge ordered a dose of sunshine for Mr.Pruitt's dirty dealings from his perch as attorney general of The judge has demanded that Mr.Pruitt cough up more than thousands of emails pertaining to his cozy relationship with Big Oil--emails he has been hiding from Oklahoma open records requests for over 2 years, but the Republican leadership is not interested in waiting. Its plan is to jam this nomination through tomorrow--4 days before the emails are slated to become public.  Are you kidding me?  If those emails show corruption, every Senator should have that information before--not after--they vote to put someone in charge of the EPA who may be there for years.  Clean air and clean water used to be a nonpartisan issue. In earlier decades, leaders in both parties had the courage to say no to suffocating smog and towering plumes of toxic chemicals poisoning our children. Republicans and Democrats came together, and together they declared that access to clean air and clean water was a basic right for all We passed the Clean Air Act, and we passed the Clean Water We updated those laws when necessary, and we did those things together.  Together, we depend on the Environmental Protection Agency for three critical reasons: The EPA is the cop on the beat, protecting American families from corporate polluters that would put profit ahead of safety. It watches out for us and for our children; the EPA exists because pollution knows no State borders. What is burned at the powerplant in Ohio is breathed by children across Massachusetts; and the EPA takes on the ever-changing task of researching, monitoring, and regulating toxic emissions because the job is far too great for any one State to tackle.  To do all of this, the EPA routinely turns to local governments, businesses, and innovative workers for local solutions; the EPA turned to the University of Massachusetts to create a research center to assist smalltown water systems; the EPA turned to towns along Cape Cod and on Martha's Vineyard to pursue innovative solutions to increase coastal resiliency as sea levels have risen; and the EPA recently recognized New Bedford's exceptional work in monitoring industrial waste discharge in the city's collection system.  Across Massachusetts and across the Nation, the EPA sets big national goals that help inspire ingenious local solutions. The EPA is one of our great successes as a nation, but that success has not come without a fight. Each time the EPA has taken a step to clean our air, industry has poured more and more money into the debate, yelling that regulation is just too costly and that companies can never survive if they have to clean up their act.  In the 40 years following the Clean Air Act, emissions of common air pollutants fell nearly 70 percent while the number of private sector jobs doubled. Industry talks about the costs of pollution controls because dirty is cheap. Clean air saves more than 160,000 lives each year. Clean air saves more than 3 million schooldays our children would have collectively lost. Clean air saves 13 million workdays the hard-working, healthy Americans simply can't afford to miss.  Scott Pruitt doesn't measure success by this yardstick. He measures success by how happy his corporate donors are. As Big Oil's go-to attorney general from Oklahoma, Pruitt has spent the last 6 years trying to silence the lifesaving, data-driven work of dedicated EPA employees and scientists. And now, those big polluters have their fantasy EPA nominee--someone who will work on their side and not on the side of the American people.  How about a couple of examples. When EPA issued a rule to limit mercury, arsenic, and other toxic chemical emissions from coal powerplants, Mr.Pruitt questioned whether mercury poses a health hazard. Mercury is a well-known neurotoxin. It means that it poisons the nervous system. And Scott Pruitt thinks he should question whether it poses any health hazard.  Or maybe it is this example. When the EPA moved to reduce leaks of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 30 times more potent than CO2, he turned the Oklahoma AG's office into a clearinghouse for big oil to pursue lawsuits attacking the Scott Pruitt has spent so much time with his campaign donors that he honestly appears incapable of understanding the difference between the financial interests of millionaires who run giant oil companies and the health and well-being of the 4[[Page S1272]]million human beings who actually live in  The people need a voice more than ever. For generations, Oklahoma has had very few earthquakes. Then, oil companies decided to up production, to pull every last drop of oil out of the ground. But with every drop of oil came useless, toxic radioactive salt water waste, and it has to go somewhere. So they took the cheapest option available: Pump billions of barrels of wastewater deep underground, under immense pressure, and that is when the problems started. Suddenly, earthquakes--big earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.0 and above, started occurring every day across  Here was Mr.Pruitt, the State attorney general, the people's lawyer. What did he do? Did he seek relief for the families that were stiffed by insurance companies? Did he join residents who were suing to stop the drilling while their homes crumbled? Did he even pretend to do something--you know, like maybe issue a strongly worded press release supporting frightened citizens? No, not Mr.No, Mr.Pruitt stood by his friends in the oil industry, and the heck with everybody else.  Mr.Pruitt has been consistent in his work for big oil. As attorney general, he dismantled the environmental protection unit in his office--dismantled the environmental protection unit. He appointed a billionaire oil man to be his 2014 campaign chair, and he ignored the citizens he was sworn to protect. That is the measure of Mr.Pruitt as a public servant.  A State attorney general is supposed to serve the people. Right now, Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey is leading the case to prove that ExxonMobil deliberately deceived the public about the impact of climate change on our economy, our environment, our health, and our future. Good for Did Scott Pruitt join that suit? Of course not. Pruitt ran to the defense of one of the world's largest corporations, whining about how that corporation felt bullied. Instead of working as the attorney general for Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt has served as the attorney general for  Finally, Scott Pruitt has the nerve to say that the cause of climate change is ``subject to more debate.'' More debate? We had that debate in the 1980s, in the 1990s, in the 2000s. Maybe Mr.Pruitt missed it, buried under a pile of big oil money.  So let me just offer a summary. For well over a century, we spewed fossil fuel filth into our atmosphere. And, yes, this allowed us to fuel the thirsty appetite of our 20th century economy. But that blistering pace came at a price.  Our planet is getting hotter. Our coasts are threatened by furious storm surges that sweep away homes and devastate our largest cities. Our poorest neighborhoods are one bad storm away from being under water. Our naval bases are under attack--not by enemy ships but by rising seas; droughts and wildfires are all too familiar across the country. Refugees are fleeing homes that are no longer livable. And the risk of rapidly spreading diseases like malaria and Zika is on the rise.  Our coastal communities don't have time for politicians who deny science. Our farmers don't have time for more debate. Our children don't have time for more cowards who will not stand up to big oil companies defrauding the American people.  Scott Pruitt has been working hard for big oil to dismantle the EPA, and now, President Trump wants to give him that chance.  Where are the Senators who will stand up for the health, the welfare, and the safety of their citizens? Where are the Senators who will stand up for the people's right to breathe clean air and drink clean water? Where are the Senators who will have the courage to demand action on climate change so that our children will have a chance to inherent a livable Earth?  In the end, despite this despicable record, if the Republicans link arms again, there will not be enough of us to stop this nomination. But make no mistake, if President Trump wants a fight over the health of our children, a fight over the creation of clean energy jobs, a fight over the very future of our planet, then we will fight every step of the way.  We will fight alongside moms and dads who know the terror of a childhood asthma attack. We will fight alongside the cancer victims. We will fight alongside the fishermen and the hunters. We will fight alongside the families of Flint, MI, and everywhere else in America where families cannot safely turn on their water taps or step outside and take a deep breath.  We are all in this together.  People in Massachusetts care deeply about preserving a safe and healthy environment for our kids and our grandkids. We see it as a moral question. And I receive letters from people all across the State, describing how important clean air and clean water are to them and how worried they are about what Scott Pruitt leading the EPA will mean for our most vital natural resources. I hear those concerns and I share those concerns.  I would like to read just a few of the many letters that I have received about this nomination.  Edward from Dennis wrote to me on behalf of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod about the importance of the EPA to coastal communities in Here is Edward's letter:       The Association to Preserve Cape Cod (APCC), the Cape Cod      region's leading nonprofit environmental education and      advocacy organization, writes to state our strong opposition      to the appointment of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt      for the position of Administrator of the Environmental      Protection We urge you to vote against his      nomination.       APCC is deeply concerned that Mr.Pruitt's record of      vigorously opposing the efforts of the EPA to protect the      nation's water and air quality is in direct conflict with his      responsibilities as EPA Administrator to ensure that the      agency's important work continues. In fact, his record      clearly shows that his loyalties side with polluters      instead of with the environment and the welfare of the      American people. Of particular concern is Mr.Pruitt's      refusal to accept the science of climate change and the      implications this has for EPA's ongoing efforts to reduce      greenhouse gas emissions.       In addition, the EPA has most recently played a vital role      in furthering efforts to protect and restore water quality      through its Southeast New England Program (SNEP) for      Watershed Restoration, a program that has greatly benefited      coastal communities in Rhode Island and southeastern      We worry that important initiatives such as      the SNEP program, which was originally proposed by Senator      Reed with the strong support from each of you, will be in      jeopardy under the oversight of Mr.Pruitt, should he be      confirmed as EPA       The New England states, as well as the entire nation, have      made significant strides forward in addressing the protection      of our air and water. However, much more needs to be      accomplished. With so much at stake, we cannot afford to step      backward in our effort to protect the environment. We,      therefore, urge you to oppose the nomination of Mr.Pruitt      for EPA  Thanks, Edward, for writing, and thanks to all of you at the Association to Preserve Cape Cod for the work you are doing every single day. It makes a real difference.  While all sorts of people have written to my office about Mr.Pruitt, I have noticed that a lot of people are writing in about kids--their kids, kids they work with, or just kids in general. My constituents are concerned about Scott Pruitt's commitment to protecting the air our kids breathe and the water they drink, and I share those concerns.  I heard from Mary in Worcester, who is concerned about the effects of environmental toxins like lead on children. She is concerned both as a parent and as a family doctor. Here is what Mary had to say:       With so much focus in Washington on ensuring politicians      are held to a strong ethical standard, I ask you to oppose      the nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA I wrote      to you yesterday asking the same, but after the hearing      yesterday, it is increasingly clear that Mr.Pruitt is unfit.       In addition to being a parent, I am also a Family Medicine      physician. Rarely, I see children who are exposed to lead      through environmental sources. This is rare because lead has      been regulated, and as such rates of lead poisoning, and the      accompanying irreversible brain damage, have plummeted.       But yesterday Mr.Pruitt revealed that he knows nothing      about this issue, responding to Senator Cardin, ``Senator,      that is something I have not reviewed nor know about.''       I continue to ask you to oppose him and to encourage      colleagues to do the same.  Thank you for writing, That is why I am here tonight--to encourage my colleagues to oppose him.  I heard from Elizabeth in Belchertown, as well. Here is what she wrote:       As a resident of MA and a teacher of AP Environmental      Science in a public high[[Page S1273]]     school in western MA, I am writing to express my concern      about the appointment of Scott Pruitt as director of the      He appears to be the exact opposite of the qualifications and      perspective of a person who should have that position. As you      know, he has close ties to fossil fuels, has repeatedly sued      the EPA, avoided mercury legislation, and espoused the belief      that the EPA is too powerful. I urge you to work with other      Senators to block this appointment.  Thank you, The work that you are doing, that teachers are doing, is more vital than ever now, and I share your concerns. Thank you.  A man from Boston wrote to me with concerns about Scott Pruitt's ties to fossil fuel companies, and here is what he said:       As a constituent who cares about our environment, I want      you to know I am deeply concerned about the nomination of      Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection       Scott Pruitt is firmly in the pocket of the oil and gas      industry. He is not concerned with the world we leave for our      children. As a father and an educator, I am fighting his      nomination because I have a responsibility to care about the      world I leave children and not merely the wealth my cronies      accumulate.       Pruitt has actively worked to dismantle protections for      clean air and clean water that people and birds need to      thrive. The EPA must adhere to science and support common-     sense solutions for ensuring a healthy environment and stable      climate for people and wildlife.       Please oppose confirming Scott Pruitt and demand a nominee      instead who will represent the vast majority of Americans--     regardless of party affiliation--who support strong action      and safeguards for our air, water, and climate.  I couldn't agree more with what he said.  Wendy from Newton wrote to me about the concerns as well. Here is what she had to say:       Dear Senator, I am appalled and scared by the possibility      of Scott Pruitt to head the It will be disgraceful if he      is confirmed. To appoint someone who stands against      everything that agency is for is cynical, disrespectful and      dangerous in this urgent time of climate change. Now more      than ever we need a strong EPA that believes in science and      will protect us from environmental disaster. I hope you will      do everything you possibly can to fight against Pruitt      getting confirmed.  Thank you for writing.  I also heard from Arlene in Wayland, who is worried about what the future of the EPA means for her two grandchildren. Here is what she had to say:       Senator Warren, please assure your constituents that you      will not support Scott Pruitt's nomination to head the      Mr.Pruitt is an enemy of the agency and of the future of our      environment. He has stood in the way of the agency's purpose      to protect our air and water. He is ignorant of the findings      of climate science and medical studies on toxicity, has dealt      dishonestly with Congress, and is so obviously in the pocket      of the fossil fuel industry. Please use your considerable      persuasiveness and rigor to convince your colleagues in the      Senate to ditch his nomination. The future of my two      grandchildren depends on it. Thank you.  Thank you for your note, I am doing my best, and so are the rest of the We just need some Republicans to help us out here.  Joan from Maynard reached out to me about her experience working with children who have suffered from lead poisoning. Here is what Joan wrote:       I have been an Educational Advocate for children with      disabilities for 24 years. I've worked with children who      suffer from lead poisoning, and they are heartbreaking. Even      the smallest exposure has life-long profound consequences. I      haven't personally seen anything the level of what has      happened in Flint, MI, but I know that it's a tragedy for a      generation of children in       Pollution of our waters is just one of the risks we face if      Scott Pruitt is approved. There are countless more, many      evident and others not readily apparent, but ready to unfold.      Please, please fight this appointment in every way you can.  Thank you, Joan, for writing and for the important work you do. Believe me, I am fighting in every way I can.  A man from North Falmouth wrote to me, worried that the progress we have made on protecting public health and the future of our planet is in danger. Here is what he said:       Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is a lifelong ally      of corporate polluters. Pruitt's nomination is a clear threat      to the nation's public health and the progress made on      common-sense pollution standards. I cannot tolerate the      appointment of a fossil fuel cheerleader to lead the nation's      environmental protection efforts. In 2014, Pruitt literally      acted as a messenger between Devon Energy and the EPA in an      attempt to stifle public health protections.       Please continue to defend the Clean Power Plan and methane      pollution standards against the influence of the fossil fuel      industry. 64% of Americans are concerned about climate      change, we deserve a leader who will take action to protect      air quality.  Thanks for writing. I really appreciate it.  Since President Trump nominated Mr.Pruitt, I have received hundreds of letters like these from people in Massachusetts who are worried about what he will mean for the environment and for the future of our planet, but I have also heard from the experts, people who understand the ins and outs of the EPA and its mission. Hundreds of former EPA employees who have serious concerns about Mr.Pruitt's record on the environment sent a letter to me and my colleagues here in the Here is what they wrote:       We write as former employees of the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) to share our concerns about Oklahoma      Attorney General Scott Pruitt's qualifications to serve as      the next EPA Administrator in light of his record in      Our perspective is not partisan. Having served      under both Republican and Democratic presidents, we recognize      each new Administration's right to pursue different policies      within the parameters of existing law and to ask Congress to      change the laws that protect public health and the      environment as it sees fit.       However, every EPA Administrator has a fundamental      obligation to act in the public's interest based on current      law and the best available science. Mr.Pruitt's record      raises serious concerns about whose interests he has served      to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of      U.environmental law.       Our nation has made tremendous progress in ensuring that      every American has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink      and uncontaminated land on which to live, work and play.      Anyone who visits Beijing is reminded of what some cities in      the U.once looked like before we went to work as a people      to combat pollution. Much of the EPA's work involves      preserving those gains, which should not be taken for      granted. There are also emerging new threats as well as      serious gaps in our environmental safety net, as the      drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, painfully      demonstrates.       Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that      requires EPA to set national standards and give states      latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum      criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that      Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no      matter where they live, and allows states to compete for      business without having to sacrifice public health or      environmental quality.       Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to      allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which      is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is      reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even      when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,      EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit      the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its      harmfulness to public health was erased. His actions spared      much of the harm that some countries still face as a result      of the devastating effects of lead on human health.      Similarly, early action to reduce exposure to fine particle      pollution helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from      heart and lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those      risks did not become apparent until much later.       Mr.Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest      that he does not share the vision or agree with the      underlying principles of our environmental statutes.

He also has shady ties to Vladimir Putin's That is just his record. Because of that record, I do not have confidence that he will protect the interests of the American people as Secretary of  This administration's disturbing ties to Russia have been all over the news. Here is what has been publicly reported as of today.  Our intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian Government conducted a successful series of cyber attacks against the United States designed to help Donald Trump get elected Our intelligence agencies are actively examining a dossier alleging that the Russian Government has collected compromising information on President Trump, and numerous press reports indicate that investigators have already corroborated some of that dossier's contents.  The President's National Security Advisor resigned in disgrace and is the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation for his conversations with the Russian Government before the inauguration, conversations that may have been illegal and conversations that he has apparently lied about in public.  Knowingly or unknowingly, the Vice President of the United States has repeated these lies on national television. According to CNN, high-level advisers close to then-Presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to U.intelligence.  CNN confirmed the New York Times' original investigation with ``multiple current and former intelligence law enforcement and administration officials.'' Our allies documented regular calls between the Trump campaign and the Russians, confirming the reports of U.intelligence agencies. According to reports published in Newsweek, ``the British government obtained information that people acting on behalf of Russia were in contact with members of the Trump campaign.''  Many news outlets have reported on U.intelligence worries that NATO allies will no longer share sensitive information because they fear the new administration could share it with When asked about the regular points of contact between Russian intelligence operatives and his most senior campaign staff, President Trump refused to take the question seriously. He claimed the multiple reports of staff communications with Russian were ``fake news.''  Behind the scenes, Trump's chief of staff was pressuring the FBI to help cover up the links between Russia and the Trump campaign. We are 1 month into the Trump I wish this were not happening. I wish things were normal, but this is not normal. It is shameful if we ignore all of it as we evaluate the President's nominees to critical foreign policy and national security jobs.  In this context, Mr.Ross's connections to Russia raise dangerous issues. We know that Ross installed a former KGB official and close associate of Vladimir Putin as the vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, a bank that Mr.Ross controlled and a bank that was flooded with Russian money. Now, how closely connected was this former KGB official to Vladimir Putin? Here is one hint. He was so closely connected to Putin that he was given a $100 million payout by a Russian-controlled mining company as a golden parachute. He wasn't even the only Putin pal on Mr.Ross's board. That is right. Mr.Ross wanted the bank he controlled to have multiple board members from Putin's inner circle.  Mr.Ross surrounds himself with Russian oligarchs, and he has invested financially in their success. As he explained during his testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, Mr.Ross has no intention of divesting from Diamond Shipping, a company that operates 33 oil tankers and jointly charters with even more. So a man who personally selected multiple Vladimir Putin associates to serve with him on the board of the bank he controls has been totally open about his plan to continue profiting from oil tankers shuttling over $1 billion worth of crude oil through international waters while serving as Commerce  It is not just one shipping company. Mr.Ross is retaining his investments in 11--11 separate entities, mostly private companies registered in the Cayman Among his retained interests, the state-owned China Investment Company will be one of Mr.Ross's largest fellow investors.  We have never seen a Cabinet like this in history. Like many of President Trump's other nominees and like President Trump himself, this nominee seems to see his time in public service as a chance to increase his own wealth. In other words, on any given deal, he might be working for the American people or he might just be working for himself. We will have no way to know.  President Trump has apparently asked Mr.Ross to lead American trade policy. He claims to want aggressive enforcement of antidumping and currency manipulation rules, which sounds great, but when Ross actually has this job, is he really going to be thinking about American workers or will he be thinking about how to make his KGB buddy from the Bank of Cyprus just a little richer or will he be thinking about how to help out his own oil tankers circling the globe or will he be thinking about his offshore companies and his coinvestors from China or will he be thinking about the next billion dollars he plans to make?  The American people should not be left guessing about who Mr.Ross will be working to protect. There is significant reason to believe the President of the United States has substantial financial ties with Russia, but nobody actually knows any of the details because he has failed to reveal his tax returns.  Now President Trump expects the Senate to rubberstamp his nomination of a top banker to Vladimir Putin's buddies to run the Commerce Department of the United This is dangerous and I will vote no. Mr.Ross's financial ties with Russians and his worldwide business deals are not the only problem with this nomination. He is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself. Ross ran a secret club of top Wall Street tycoons called Kappa Beta I am not making this up. It is actually true.  So he runs this secret club, which apparently gathers every year to get drunk and entertain themselves by putting on off-color skits that make fun of the millions of Americans they have swindled over the years. That certainly reflects Mr.Ross's world view. This is a man who made a fortune from the housing crisis at the expense of working families. After buying the servicing rights to over $100 billion in subprime loans, Mr.Ross swiftly got to work cheating borrowers out of their homes.  Here are just a few of the examples of Mr.Ross's approach to business: lying to borrowers about loan modifications; charging borrowers fees that were not authorized; taking payments from borrowers, then not applying those payments to their loans; forcing homeowners insurance on borrowers who already had homeowners insurance; robo-signing fraudulent foreclosure documents.  The violations were so widespread, his company had to settle with 49[[Page S1424]]Let me repeat that--49 A man who builds a fortune off illegally cheating people out of their homes has no business running our Commerce  So let's summarize. Mr.Ross has extensive ties to He plans to keep making money from his major oil shipping companies while working as Commerce He has made billions off the backs of struggling homeowners, and in his free time he hangs out with Wall Street tycoons who sit around and make fun of everyone else.

Alaskans have hunted and managed their land for generations, and this overreach by the Fish and Wildlife Service simply impedes their ability to do just that.  Allow me to read from the 2016-2017 Alaska Trapping Regulations, one of many sound management documents usurped by this bureaucratic overreach:  ``Wolves and bears are very effective and efficient predators of caribou, moose, deer, and other wildlife. In most of Alaska, humans also rely on the same species for food. In Alaska's Interior, predators kill more than 80 percent of the moose and caribou that die during an average year, while humans kill less than 10 percent. In most of the state, predation holds prey populations at levels far below what could be supported by the habitat in the area. Predation is an important part of the ecosystem, and all . . . wolf management programs, including control programs, are designed to sustain wolf populations in the future.''  Additionally, the regulations go on to say:  ``You may not: disturb or destroy beaver houses or any furbearer den.'' Such as wolves, coyote, or mink.  Mr.Speaker, the claim that this bill will allow Alaskans to hunt wolves in their dens is simply false rhetoric, designed to mislead the public, while bureaucrats take away the rights of The people of Alaska rely on these lands to provide for their families, and this Fish and Wildlife rule attempts to insert Washington bureaucrats into that process.[[Page H1263]]  Mr.Speaker, I cringe to think about U.Fish and Wildlife usurping established law.

590,topic-id,1953,"Mr.President, we are considering the nomination of Congressman Mulvaney to become the Director of the Office of Management and In the context of the review of this nomination, there has been a lot of talk about Congressman Mulvaney being a ``straight shooter.'' I do appreciate his courtesy meeting with me and his participation in our Budget Committee confirmation hearing last month, but I have to say that his 6-year record in the House of Representatives makes it completely impossible for me to vote for him as our Nation's chief budget officer.  He may be a straight shooter, but he shoots straight at the wrong targets. One of them is the credit of the United States of In the House of Representatives, Congressman Mulvaney repeatedly put our economy in jeopardy by voting to let the Federal Government default on its obligations. He had an opportunity after his nomination, when he came before the Budget Committee, to pivot to a more mainstream and responsible position, but he refused. In an answer to a prehearing question he said:       I do believe that defaulting on America's debts would have      great worldwide consequences. I do not believe that breaching      the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably lead to      that result.  Well, if you breach the debt ceiling, and if you honor the debt ceiling law, that means that our government would not have the money to pay all of its bills. Something has to be defaulted on or the debt ceiling is a complete chimera.  Mr.Mulvaney's completely unsupported faith that a default on some of our Nation's obligations might not have grave consequences ignores basic economics, and it ignores the guidance[[Page S1215]]of liberal and conservative economists and experts alike, including Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Benjamin Bernanke, Hank Paulson, Janet Yellen, Jack Lew, and many, many others.  In fact, many of my Republican colleagues in this room were gravely concerned about what happened if we blew through the debt ceiling, and that we perhaps had made a bet we would be unable to pay. To put it simply, lenders tend to charge more for riskier loans, and a borrower that won't pay all of its bills on time is riskier than one that does.  Tom Donahue of the U.Chamber of Commerce is not someone that I ordinarily cite favorably here in the He is an inveterate enemy on doing anything on climate change. He and I disagree on a great number of issues, but even Tom Donahue noted that a small increase in treasury rates, which would happen as the result of a default, ``would translate into hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every year.''  A member of the self-styled ``shutdown caucus,'' Mr.Mulvaney chooses to ignore the fact that his fiscal brinkmanship has already cost the American people. Playing around with the debt ceiling and shutting down the government are not free exercises. According to the Wall Street firm Standard and Poor's, the 16-day government shutdown that the Congressman helped orchestrate in 2013 cost the American economy $24 billion. That is shooting straight at our economy just to prove a political point. That is not the kind of straight shooter that we need. Of course, that doesn't even mention the unnecessary stress that the shutdown caused for millions of government contractors who weren't sure they would be paid. There is pain and there is damage from the reckless decisions that Congressman Mulvaney seems to make so easily.  Congressman Mulvaney's blind faith is not limited to economics. He disregards science too. In response to questions I asked him at the hearing, he said he is not convinced by the evidence presented that climate change is at least partly driven by human activity. Well, he ought to take a little look at what is going on at his home State university, the University of South Carolina, which has the School of the Earth, Ocean, and It actually teaches climate change. The University of South Carolina doesn't just believe climate change; it teaches it. It has a faculty who are involved in teaching the students about what is happening in our atmosphere and in our oceans as a result of climate change.  This is not all that complicated stuff. We have known since President Lincoln was riding around Washington in his top hat that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would catch heat in the atmosphere and would warm the That was a scientist named This is not news; this is 150 years old. It is simple, elemental chemistry, what happens when you ramp up the level of CO2 in the atmosphere and how that works in the oceans. The CO2 gets absorbed by the oceans. The oceans, as a result of absorbing CO2, become more acidic. What we are seeing now is the acidification of the ocean in the experience of humankind--indeed, in probably like 100 times the experience of humankind. You have to go back 50 years to find a similar rate of acidification of the ocean.  Well, Mr.Mulvaney represents South South Carolina is a coastal It is an ocean The University of South Carolina studies its oceans. They know ocean acidification is happening. When the Congressman says that he is not convinced by the evidence presented, something other than being a straight shooter is going on.  According to NASA, for instance, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--which, by the way, right now is driving a rover around on the surface of the planet So can we perhaps stipulate that the scientists at NASA know what they are talking about? No other country in the world, no other society in human history has had the capacity to launch from Earth a rover, fly it through space to Mars, land it safely on that other planet, and drive it around. We can do that. NASA scientists did that. So when NASA scientists say that ``multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activity''--so essentially all the experts agree.  His home State university, the University of South Carolina, teaches this. They don't just listen to it, they teach it. They understand what is going on. But Mulvaney says he is not convinced. What is it going to take to convince him? How can you be a straight shooter when you ignore this kind of certainty in science, particularly when around this building you see the circling menace of the fossil fuel industry always with its guns out, always trying to shoot down anybody who will disagree with them, always trying to pretend that climate change isn't real, always trying to defend a $700 billion-a-year subsidy that they get at the expense of the rest of America? And because, thanks to Citizens United, they have the capacity to spend enormous, unlimited amounts of money in politics, they can spend a great deal to protect that $700 billion in subsidies, and they do.  So we do nothing about climate change here. You can't get a Republican to talk seriously about climate change here. The oceans are changing off of their States, and they won't talk about climate change here. Their universities are saying that climate change is real. Their universities are teaching that climate change is real. And they won't say one thing about climate change here. And this so-called straight shooter is going to go along with that racket rather than listen to his home State universities and to the scientists at NASA, who have put the rover on Mars? Give me a break.  While this man claims to be a deficit hawk, I asked him if he was ready to take on the hundreds of billions of dollars that go out the back door of our economy in tax breaks, in wasteful tax loopholes, in tax benefits for special interests, and he wouldn't give me a straight answer to the question.  From his record in the House, it appears pretty clear that Mr.Mulvaney would rather balance the budget by going after seniors, by going after Social Security, by going after Medicare, by going after the families who have children on Medicaid because their children have lifetime disabilities that require Medicaid support. Those are the targets. That is who this so-called straight shooter wants to shoot at. But as for, say, the tax benefit that lets billionaires depreciate their private jets faster than the airline can, oh, no, can't touch that. As for the tax loophole that lets carried interest Wall Street billionaires pay lower tax rates than their doormen, than their janitors, oh, no, can't possibly touch that. As for the subsidies we give through the Tax Code to the fossil fuel industry every year when they are the most lucrative corporations in the history of the planet, oh, no, we can't possibly do that. Let's go after the old folks. That is not being a straight shooter; that is shooting at the wrong people.  Someone who is a straight shooter when it happens to agree with the politics that they like but is a flatout denier when it doesn't, that is not my idea of a straight shooter.  Congressman Mulvaney is possessed by conservative ideology that I strongly believe is going to prevent him ever from working across party lines on the budget, on health care, or on other major issues that he will have to face at His counsel is likely to pull President Trump further out to the extremes, which already divide this country.  And by the way, to all of those voters who voted for President Trump because he said that he was different from all the other Republican candidates; that he was different from the other 15 candidates because he wasn't going to hurt Social Security and he wasn't going to hurt Medicare; that he was different from all the others because he was going to protect Social Security and he was going to protect Medicare--folks, I think you were sold a bill of goods because when you look at Congressman Price and when you look at Congressman Mulvaney and when you look at their records, you see the records of people who have targeted Social Security and targeted Medicare for years. They may be straight shooters, but they have Social Security and Medicare in the crosshairs. Those are not the right targets for us to be shooting[[Page S1216]]at in a tax system that is riddled with special interest loopholes and in a country that is so divided and where the poor and the elderly are struggling compared to the people who are at the very top, who have basically gathered all of the economic benefit of our growth since the great recession.  So, for all of those reasons, I will be completely unable to support this person's confirmation. I am sorry because I would like to have seen the President make the slightest gesture in the direction of bipartisanship, the slightest gesture in the direction of compromise, the slightest gesture in the direction of reasonableness, but out of this White House, on the civilian Cabinet, we have seen nothing like that.  It is a Cabinet that is completely controlled by rightwing ideology and appalling special interests. Usually, the special interests are the most dangerous and worst special interests that the agency has to regulate. Instead of accepting that as the agency's responsibility, he has brought that special interest in, brought the fox into the henhouse. If there was ever a fox in the OMB henhouse to take our Social Security folks and our Medicare folks and hurt them, it is this  I cannot accept his nomination. I will vote against it.

Finally, Drew Edmondson used to do an annual report, as I recall, on the successes of his environmental enforcement and his environmental task force, the multiagency group. That was gone too.

As the distinguished Senator from Hawaii said, maybe there is nothing in those; maybe this is just an empty concern. But over and over and over, emails have been really important at breaking investigations open. Certainly, our friends on the other side--until the election in November--had a fascination with emails, a fixation with emails. They couldn't get enough of other people's emails. And now suddenly everybody is looking at the ceiling, examining the ceiling tiles when it is time to wonder about these emails.  There is a doctrine, if I recall successfully back in the days when I was a more active lawyer, called willful blindness, which is the wrongful act of intentionally keeping oneself unaware of something--the wrongful act of intentionally keeping oneself unaware of something. If that doesn't describe what is being done right now to the Republican Senators about these emails with this vote, I don't know what does, but what I do know is that willful blindness under the law is a culpable state of mind. It is a culpable state of mind in civil cases, where you can be held liable because of deliberate willful blindness, and it is a culpable state of mind in criminal cases, where you can be found guilty of a criminal offense based on a finding of willful blindness.  So this is no small predicament that the majority leader is creating for his Republican Members in the mad rush to get this fossil fuel tool voted on before this stuff all comes out, and it is either going to be good or it is going to be bad, and if it is bad, there will be a price to pay for having ignored this emerging avalanche of emails. If they are good, fine, no harm done, but who really gets hurt if it is bad?  We are going to be examining Pruitt over this, when they come out. If these are bad things, there could be investigations that ensue and an enormous amount of stuff can take place, but there will be ownership on the other side of the aisle for the willful blindness they are displaying toward this package of emails that we now know are on their way and that we know were wrongfully withheld because the judge said so. The judge said it was an ``abject failure'' under the law. The judge said it was unreasonable. So we know it is wrong, and still, still, comes the vote.  You have to wonder what the power force is here that makes that happen. In astronomy, there are dark stars, black holes. Because they are dark and because they are black, you can't see them in the sky. You have to deduce their presence when light bends around them and when their gravitational pull affects the behavior of other heavenly bodies. When you look for those weird, anomalous behaviors in space, that is a signal that some dark star is out there operating. This is a lot of weird and anomalous behavior. And what is the dark star that is causing the majority leader to put all the Republican Senators, other than Susan Collins, in peril, in terms of willful blindness to this release of emails, which everybody knows now is coming and which everybody knows now was wrongfully delayed--wrongfully and deliberately delayed--by this attorney general as the enforcer of the disclosure of his own emails.[[Page S1280]]    ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,1823,DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO SAVINGS,2017.0,16.0,February

We haven't talked about the dark money life of Scott Pruitt because--why?--our colleagues on the other side won't require those questions to be answered. They are perfectly willing to scoot him through without knowing a single thing about his dark money operation--his attorney general reelection, which was chaired by a fossil fuel billionaire; the Oklahoma Strong Leadership PAC, which was his leadership PAC that took constant fossil fuel money; the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which was the laundering operation for bringing money to the Republican Attorneys General  If you were one of these big companies and if you could drop money into the Rule of Law Defense Fund, it would wash your identity clean of the money, and then the money could go over to the Republican Attorneys General Association as if it were a gift from the Rule of Law Defense Fund, when all they did was launder the identity off of the fossil fuel donor. Then you had, of course, the Republican Attorneys General Association, which was so loaded up with fossil fuel interests that they had special, secret, private meetings with these big donors at their retreats. It was right on the secret agenda of the retreats, which we have been able to get our hands on.  I add that to the equation because when the Senator from Oregon talks about a complex matrix of fossil fuel interests, he is not kidding. This is a very, very significant matrix of fossil fuel interests, and that is what Scott Pruitt has been serving, not the public and not his duties.[[Page S1282]]    ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1275-2.txt,1823,MOUNT HOOD COOPER SPUR LAND EXCHANGE CLARIFICATION ACT,2017.0,16.0,February

1036,topic-id,164,"I draw the Senator's attention to this graphic my office has prepared which reflects certainly my recollection. When I came to the Senate, I want to say there were at least five Republican-sponsored climate change bills floating around. Senator John Warner, a Republican of Virginia, had one; Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, had one; Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona actually ran for President on a strong climate change platform; Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, was working with Senator Kerry on one; Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee, had one.  So there was a regular heartbeat of activity in this body on climate change, a bipartisan heartbeat of activity. Then, pow, came Citizens United 2010, and it has been flatlined since. It is the power of money unleashed into our politics, and nobody plays harder and nobody plays rougher and nobody plays meaner with the power of money than the fossil fuel industry that Scott Pruitt serves.

1039,topic-id,570,"One of the points I think could be made here with respect to the emails is that the first tranche of emails--the ones the judge instructed be released on Tuesday--are communications with Scott Pruitt's donors, with Devon Energy right here, with Peabody coal--which I don't see on the list--and with API, the American Petroleum Institute, which is right here. That funding has gone into his political operation.  It is worth understanding how that pays off. I don't know if we can see this, but this says ``confidential.'' I don't know if that is clear on the screen. This is the confidential agenda for a Republican Attorneys General Association meeting, at a nice place--the Greenbrier in West It is pretty swish. Look here on the agenda: Private meeting with Murray There is Murray Energy, right in the energy donors. He is attorney general. Look at what they get--a private meeting with the Republican attorneys general on the confidential agenda. If you go to the next day, the morning meeting is an issue briefing on the dangerous consequences of the Clean Power Plan and other EPA rules, and guess who the lead panelist is--Attorney General Scott Pruitt of  What you have is this link between a big political donor, Murray Energy, and a private meeting for Murray Energy on the confidential agenda and a followup meeting at the same retreat on attacking the Clean Power And guess who a lead plaintiff with Scott Pruitt is in the lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan? Boom--Murray  There is a little machine here that turns between money in from the fossil fuel industry and litigation out on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. These emails aren't just matters of general interest. These emails may provide some good connection, some good evidence into what exactly that little feedback loop entails, because there are plenty of circumstances, and, as somebody who spent years as an attorney general and years as the U.Attorney, those little feedback loops is sometimes called corruption.  Depending on what those emails say, that could easily be prosecutable corruption. Rather than answer that question, of whether this link between big donors and action on cases using the badge of the State of Oklahoma as a shield to protect the fossil fuel interests, which were the donors, and talking about it in confidential meetings, in private meetings on confidential agendas--to me, that smells pretty high all by itself, before you have actually dug into it and seen what the emails say and gotten to the potentially really stinky part.  The fact that this is being jammed through is not without consequence for the Republicans on the other side who are not being given the chance by their leadership to say: Hold it. Let's give this a couple of weeks. Let's see if there is something beyond how bad it is already--that perhaps might even make this chargeable stuff--before we are forced to vote on this guy.  Once again, the fact that they are being forced to vote on this guy in this circumstance is very, very unusual behavior. And unusual behavior, to me, signals powerful forces.  I could not agree more with the Senator from Oregon about the importance of these emails and their potential significance. I agree with my friend from Hawaii that I hope there isn't anything really bad here, but the likelihood that there is is very strong. The dogs are hunting.

1104,topic-id,11532,"Thank you, Mr. There is a lot we don't know about Scott We know that thousands of emails between this man and the industry that he is supposed to be regulating as EPA Administrator have been suppressed by him for years. We know that just yesterday a court found that suppression of his emails unreasonable, an abject failure of his duties under the law to disclose. Those ought to be alarm bells for the side of the aisle that is forcing, jamming this nomination through.  He told us he couldn't get these emails released for more than 2 years, and the court ordered him to release the first chunk Tuesday, just days from now; the second big chunk, 10[[Page S1333]]days from now. So clearly there has been some mischief here, when on the one hand this office pretends that it can't get the emails out for more than 2 years, and a court looks at the situation and says: You make them available That is not a sign of good things.  2, this is a guy who, as part of his political money operation--a political money operation that is heavily funded by big fossil fuel industry players about whose carbon emissions he will be making vital decisions as EPA So far, his relationship with them has been to take their money and to be their lawyer. That is not a good start, either, for an EPA  Here is the other thing we don't know: We don't know about his dark money operation. The Rule of Law Defense Fund--the whole reason you set up something like that is to hide the source of money that you use in politics. That is why the entity exists. It is to take groups like this and launder their identities right off of them so that, when money shows up, for instance, at the Republican Attorneys General Association, it is not attached to Devon Energy; it is not attached to ExxonMobil; it is not attached to Murray Energy; it is not attached to the Koch brothers or to their front groups--Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity--it is not attached to the company whose billionaire president was his finance chairman for his campaign, Continental Resources; it is not attached to the Southern Company and to other big energy companies. It just comes out of the Rule of Law Defense The identity of the donor has been scrubbed away. It is an identity laundering machine.  These are the relationships that are forged when you are asking people for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and $1 million a year was the budget for the Rule of Law Defense If you are asking for that kind of money from these people, it is elementary that the Senate should know about that, but our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have completely stonewalled this--zero inquiry into the dark money operation that this individual was allowed.  Why is that? That is pretty unusual. Why were we not allowed to get these emails? Why were we told: Oh, you will have to line up behind everybody else in this FOIA line that I have maintained for 2 years. That was an adequate answer to the majority on the EPW Committee, but the judge who took a look at that same situation said: No, you get them If the chairman had said: No, you get them Tuesday, we wouldn't be having this problem. We would have seen them weeks and weeks and weeks ago.  All of the pressure from the majority on this nominee has been to cover up this stuff. Don't let it in. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along. Move along.  That is not right. That is not the way the Senate should behave. That is not consistent with our advice and consent responsibilities, and, frankly, it sets up Republican If and when it ultimately does come out that there is significant mischief exposed in those emails or if there are significant conflicts of interest created by that dark money operation, the Senate does not look great for having used its energy and effort in this nomination to cover that stuff up.  There is a doctrine called willful blindness, which is the wrongful intention to keep oneself deliberately unaware of something. It is a culpable state of mind in criminal and civil law. That is the state of mind that is being maintained by the majority with respect to this individual, and one has to wonder why. Why are there these big things that we don't know about Scott Pruitt?  It is not that we didn't ask. It is that we got told by the majority: Run along; it doesn't matter. You will have no support from us. We are going to clear this guy anyway. It doesn't matter if his answers to you make no sense. It doesn't matter if his answers aren't truthful. It doesn't matter if his answers put you at the end of a long FOIA line when this is the Senate's advice and consent process. None of that matters.  Just by one point of evaluation, the difference is that, when the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works looked at this, they said: Run along; nothing here. We are not interested. Don't show us a single email.  And the judge looking at it said to get them out Tuesday--a local State judge.  Since when is the double standard in which Senators are deprived of seeing highly relevant evidence? What is being covered up and why? Who is pulling the strings around here so that these obvious questions don't get answered when you put it side by side with a State court proceeding that asks the same question and the questions get answered like that. Something is rotten in  It hasn't fooled Rhode My correspondence is running about 50 to 1 against Scott Over 1,000 Rhode Islanders have written in against him. Let me just read a couple of their communications with me.  This is from Amanda Tarzwell:       As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public      Works, I urge you to do all you can--  ``All you can,'' she says--     to block Mr.Pruitt's nomination as the head of the My      grandfather, Clarence Tarzwell, worked for the EPA and opened      the EPA lab in  Narragansett is a Rhode Island town.       It is located on Tarzwell Drive in his honor. He is now      deceased, but I believe in the work he did and the necessity      to protect our environment and continue to work on climate      change. Please do everything you can to urge your fellow      committee members on both sides of the aisle to do the same.      Thank you.  On the next, her name is right in the letter. So I will read it:       I am a 23-year-old woman with a bachelor of science degree      in wildlife and conservation biology from the University of      Rhode       I am writing to respectfully demand you vote ``no'' on the      approval of Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the      Environmental Protection It is extremely clear that      Pruitt is the WRONG choice to head the       As someone with an extensive education in environmental      sciences, conservation, wildlife and plant biology,      chemistry, and physics, I am deeply concerned with Pruitt's      capabilities. A climate change skeptic, with no formal      science-based education, Pruitt has zero concept of what it      takes to make informed decisions about the current and future      stakes of our environment.       Rhode Island is leading the country in many environmental      fields, such as renewable energy, environmental protection,      and sustainable agriculture and aquaculture. We cannot allow      a climate change skeptic, with a love affair with fossil      fuels, to make important decisions regarding our precious      environment and those working hard to protect it.       I urge you to vote no on the approval of Scott Pruitt for      Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Catherine Hoyt wrote in:       I have a special concern for the upcoming vote on the EPA      Director, Scott I know you are on the Committee for      Environment and Public Works so you are more informed than      most people--  Although, as I just explained, we are deliberately underinformed in some very telling ways--     and I trust that you are unlikely to vote contrary to the      interests of our beautiful and environmentally unique coastal            Among other things I do, I am a sailing instructor in      Edgewood, in  Cranston is another one of our municipalities.       I have been sailing in the Upper Bay for about 10 years.      Even in that amount of time, the bay is noticeably cleaner.      The water is clearer, and there are more birds and fish and      crabs and other creatures that signify, through my direct      experience, that the environment is healthier in the Upper            My anecdotal evidence is also confirmed by scientific      reports from URI--  The University of Rhode Island--     over the summer that Narragansett Bay is cleaner now than it      has been in 150 years. I would be very sorry to      see that trend reverse. I am old enough to remember what it      was like before the EPA, and I do not want to go back to      smog-filled skies, polluted waters, and tragedies like Love      Canal and Woburn's poisoned well water.       I am sure that, if it were not for the EPA and groups like      Save the Bay--which is a local environmental organization--     that the Upper Bay would have become more toxic and polluted      due to industrial use, sewage, rainwater runoff, pesticides,      and road salt. What is more, I believe that the EPA      regulations have been good for business. Because pollution      is, ultimately, wasteful and counterproductive, and clean      businesses often are efficient and, therefore, more      successful businesses. Look at the careful reutilization of      materials by companies like Apple, who are investing in the      future and their profitability by going further than      required. They are nearly cash neutral at this point.  Some of that is through buying carbon credit, but, clearly, they are not[[Page S1334]]afraid of being environmentally responsible.       As a concerned citizen of Rhode Island and America,      regarding President Trump's nomination for head of the      Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, I believe      deeply that this is not the person for the job, that there is      nothing in his background that suggests he has any interest      in protecting American citizens and their health and      environment from harm. I have never written any of my      congressional Representatives in my many, many years on this      planet until today.       I remember the air quality in Rhode Island in the late      sixties and through the seventies-plus. Those visible brown      clouds, especially in the summer, as pollution and smog      drifted from New York or Connecticut towards Rhode I      remember the pollution in our beautiful Narragansett I      see the changes ocean rise has already effected.       Climate change is real, and it is scientifically accepted      across the world. I am deeply troubled by Mr.Pruitt's      statements and legal actions he has instigated against this      I am asking you to take a stand for the health of the      citizens of Rhode Island and the American people. Please vote      no when the votes are called for Mr.Scott Pruitt's      nomination.  Here is the last one I will read:       As a retired Federal scientist, meteorologist, I am deeply      concerned that the EPA continue to be an agency that makes      decisions about our environment that are based on the best      science available.       Scott Pruitt has a record of supporting policies that are      pro-business at the expense of the environment despite what      the science shows. How can he possibly be considered as the      voice that will fight for clean air and clean water? Despite      excellent progress over my lifetime, pollution continues to      be a major problem for the air we breathe and the water that      sustains us.       Please join the voices on the Hill that block the      appointment of Scott Pruitt as EPA Thank you.  I wish we could block the appointment of Scott Pruitt as EPA It is really rare to see a nominee for a Federal agency who is as unqualified--indeed, as disqualified by conflict of interest--as this individual. As for the idea that he is being jammed through just as thousands of emails are going to be released about him--between him and his big funders and the groups that they funded him through--something is wrong. This is not the way the Senate should behave.  The people on that side--in taking all of this mystery, all of this mischief, all of the emails, all of the dark money--who are being asked to vote are being told: Don't even look at that.  I can promise you that if the shoe were on the other foot, Republicans would be clamoring for emails.  This is a grim day for this Chamber--what we are doing here, knowing of this man's record, knowing of his record of shutting down the environmental agency in his home State while attacking the environmental agency of the Federal Government while pretending that his concern is federalism; right? He has pretended that he thinks that the enforcement responsibility shouldn't be at the Federal level, that it should be down at the State level. But if that were even remotely sincere, he wouldn't have shut down his own office's environmental enforcement unit as the attorney general of  The common thread here is that he doesn't want any environmental enforcement at the Federal level and he doesn't want any environmental enforcement at the State level. He shut down the unit. He zeroed out the budget. He gave us a bunch of soft soap about how actually he moved the environmental unit into something called a federalism unit. But if you look at his own website for the federalism unit, the word ``environmentalism'' or ``environment'' doesn't appear. It is news that that is his environmental enforcement section, because it doesn't say so on his own website. That was an invention just for the hearing.  When you look at his own budget, the amount he budgets for environmental enforcement disappears. It has gone to zero. When you look at the Environmental Enforcement Task Force that his office's environmental unit had participated in under the previous attorney general, Drew Edmondson, that has disappeared too. He has gotten rid of every element of environmental enforcement that he controlled at the State level, while taking money from all of the big polluters, while having the CEO of Continental Resources--a billionaire--as his fundraising chair.  He took money from the fossil fuel industry through all of these different entities--through his leadership PAC, Liberty 2.0; through his campaign, Pruitt for Attorney General; through his super PAC, Oklahoma Strong PAC--sorry, that is his leadership PAC, and Liberty 2.0 is his super PAC--through the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which is his dark money operation. By the way, whatever the attorney general needs is a dark money operation. Really? Through the Republican Attorneys General Association, which he raised money for, and who knows what else.  This guy is fully fossil fuel funded. And in his entire career, he has dedicated himself to getting rid of and attacking environmental enforcement wherever he finds it--at the State or Federal level. You can't beat shutting down the environmental unit in your own office.  So that is what we are looking at. When you look at that combination and throw in the secrecy about the dark money operation and this mad rush to get this guy through before the week is out in which these emails come out, it stinks.  What we are doing here is a deliberate act of sabotage of the orderly and honest operation of an agency of our government. We are putting in a person who can demonstrably be shown to be incapable of and disqualified for those duties. I think that is actually not a bug in this program; that is the feature. That is the feature because these same forces that have been behind Scott Pruitt all his life, as he has fought all environmental enforcement--State and Federal--are awfully powerful in this Chamber as well, and they are obviously calling the shots at the White House, where a nominee like this would come from.  We are in the process of deliberately sabotaging the orderly and honest operation of an agency of the U.Government, not at the behest of a foreign power but after a special interest--the biggest and, in my view, the foulest special interest in the world today--the fossil fuel industry.  The fossil fuel industry has become so big and so powerful and so mercenary that it has decided its best investment is no longer in oil fields or coal seams or fossil fuel processing plants, but in acquiring a controlling interest in the Government of the United And it turns out we come pretty cheap.  According to the International Monetary Fund, we give the fossil fuel industry a subsidy every year in the United States alone of $700 billion. That is a more valuable prize than any drilling rights or any mining lease. To protect it--to protect $700 billion a year--acquiring a controlling interest in the U.Government is a bargain. One fossil fuel front group spent $750 million in the last election. That is a 1-to-1,000 payback--a 1,000 times ROI--each year that they keep the $700 billion subsidy if they keep plowing $700 million a year into politics to produce results like this nominee for  You get benefits once you have acquired that controlling interest.  Only one Republican has publicly taken a stand against Scott Pruitt, the most compromised and corrupted nominee in memory, with huge holes of secrecy still around his relationship with the industry he is supposed to regulate--nobody else, just the one. No Senators from States whose big cities are flooded by rising seas on sunny days, no Senator from States whose historic native villages are washing into the sea, no Senators from States who are losing ancient forests to pine beetles and wildfires, nor from States whose farmers see unprecedented extremes of flood and drought, and whose home State universities assign responsibility for those new extremes to climate change caused by carbon emissions from companies like these--none from the States whose fisheries are imperiled by warming and acidifying seas--no one. There is just that one How well this industry is succeeding.  This EPA nominee may be compromised and corrupted, but he is compromised and corrupted by the fossil fuel industry. So there is no talking about it on that side. Everybody just studies the ceiling tiles when the subject comes up. Nobody will help us find out about the thousands of stonewalled emails with his fossil fuel industry patrons. Nobody will help us inquire into the nominee's fossil-fuel-funded dark money operation. Nobody challenges[[Page S1335]]his nonsense answers in the confirmation process. He answered, he answered; let's move along, let's move along.  The dark hand of the fossil fuel industry is all over this nomination. This is the wolf being deliberately inserted into the lamb fold. It is from the fossil fuel money that fueled his politics--unknown fully because we refuse to shine the Senate's light into his dark money operation--to the thousands of emails between him and his fossil fuel industry patrons, only a fraction of which have been brought to light throughout our confirmation process, and which were only uncorked after his office was sued--not because of any effort on the other side in the confirmation process--to the fossil fuel front groups that have come out supporting this nominee and are spending millions to push him through. Think about that. These groups are funding ad campaigns to push this guy through. Obviously, they have expectations about how well they are going to be treated by him. Through all of that, the sting of this industry's influence is profound.  Just reflect on that last point. A dark money operation is being cranked up by polluters to ram the EPA nominee through.  Here is a headline:       Energy executives, secretive nonprofit raise money to back            New group warns that EPA nominee's confirmation ``is not a      certainty'' and millions of dollars are needed for the fight.  There would have been a time when it would have been disqualifying when polluters were raising millions of dollars needed for a fight to ram through an EPA nominee. This is conflict of interest in plain day, but it is a conflict of interest with the right folks around here, I guess, and so we don't consider it conflict of interest any longer.  Whom do you suppose most of the dark money is? Well, we don't know, because it is dark money. But who is it usually? Well, the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, and their front groups. And what do you suppose they want to spend millions of dollars for? What could be better for them, the biggest polluters on the planet, than a little minion to run the EPA as Every Polluter's Ally.''  In any sane world, the fact that all this dark and dirty money is being spent to ram through an EPA nominee would be disqualifying all by itself--but not here, not now, not in a Congress that is so compliant to the fossil fuel industry that this alarm bell doesn't even register.  Fossil fuel front groups sent a joint letter of support for their little minion Here is the letter with all of these various groups who I think are united in their dependence on fossil fuel money.  Here is the legendary Heartland They are that classy group that compared climate scientists to the That has been their contribution to the discussion about climate change.  Competitive Enterprise Institute, Americans For Tax Reform, groups from the State Policy Network--why don't these folks turn up somewhere else? They turn up in the research of academics who are actually studying the climate denial operation--because it is an operation. You can follow the money from the fossil fuel industry out into an array of front groups--front groups by the dozen--whose whole purpose in life is to make them look like they are not fossil fuel industry front groups. So they have names like the Heartland Institute or the George Marshall Institute, which, by the way, has nothing to do with George Marshall or his family. They just took the name because everybody knows what a respected individual George Marshall was. They just took the name and went to work phonying up the climate change debate under the name of George  That is a pretty shameful act when you think what George Marshall did for this country, but these are not people for whom shame has much effect.  If you look at Brulle's analysis--he is one of the academics who looks at this array of front groups that are fossil fuel funded--this group of people, of entities that signed the letter for this guy--they show up here too--small world.  Well, I wonder whom they thought that letter would convince? I don't think they expected it would convince many Many of us on the Democratic side have gone to the floor of the Senate to call out these fossil-fuel-funded, dark-money-driven front groups, as the fossil-fuel-funded, dark-money front groups that they are.  So I don't think Democrats are very plausible targets for that letter. So why the letter? Well, my view is that this was done because everyone in this building knows that the Koch brothers' political operation is behind all of these groups--many wiggly tentacles of the same fossil fuel polluter Behind this letter is the same Koch brothers political operation that warned Republicans of the political peril--not my word, their word--that Republicans would be in if they crossed this industry, of ``how severely disadvantaged''--another quote from the industry books--``they would be if they dared to do anything on climate change.''  That is what this letter is. It is a signal. It is the political mailed fist of the Koch brothers in a front-group glove giving its marching orders. In any sane and normal world, this letter by itself from all these polluter front groups would be disqualifying, but it appears this body will obediently turn the Environmental Protection Agency of our government over to the minion of the polluters to join an administration dead-set to destroy science with politics. It is like everyone on the other side has been sworn to secrecy while this happens in plain view.  This is a heartbreaking speech for me. I perhaps need to start with a little personal background to explain.  Last year, we commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. After Pearl Harbor was attacked, boys across America rushed to sign up for the service of their country. My father and my uncle were two of those boys. Both became pilots in the Pacific theater. My dad was a Marine Corps dive bomber pilot; my uncle was a carrier-based Navy fighter pilot. My uncle was killed over the Actually, he was under John McCain's grandfather's command--small world--but I doubt that Admiral McCain knew who Ensign Whitehouse was.  My father came home from the war, and he served our country all his life, first as a CIA officer and then as a decorated career diplomat. I believe he won every award the State Department has to offer, and he served in difficult, challenging, poor, and war-torn countries his whole life. At the end, he came out of retirement to set up Special Operations Command in the Pentagon for President Ronald  I was raised in that life. We were often in dangerous and war-torn places, and we were surrounded by American families who faced the discomforts, the diseases, and the dangers of those far-away postings because to them something mattered. Something mattered to take your family to a place where, if your child was sick, there was no decent hospital. Something mattered to take your family to a place that if your child was bit by a dog, there was a good chance the dog was rabid. Something mattered to take your family to places where the electricity wasn't reliable, the water wasn't clean, the people weren't friendly, and diseases abounded.  These folks didn't talk about it a lot. Today, a lot of people wear their patriotism on their sleeve. It was not really a topic of conversation, but it was a thread through their lives that showed that in their choices something mattered. They didn't wear their patriotism on their sleeves; they lived it.  The American Government that they served and that my uncle died serving was, to them, an ideal. Did America sometimes fall short of that ideal? But I will tell you what: Every other country in the world knew the difference between America and everybody else. We stood out for what we stood for. Across our agencies of government, for decades, many Americans have worked quietly and honorably to advance that American ideal.  At the heart of that ideal is a duty, and the duty is to put country first, to put the American people first, even before your own families's comfort and safety. That honor and that duty running through the lives and service of millions of public servants are the core heartstrings of American democracy.  Into that government, this Trump administration has nominated as Administrator of the EPA, a tool of the[[Page S1336]]fossil fuel industry, a man who demonstrably will not take his government responsibilities seriously because he never has. He has never taken EPA's responsibility seriously. He has done nothing but sue them. He has never taken his State's environmental responsibility seriously. He has shut down the enforcement arm that his office had. He will represent with the biggest conflict of interest in history a polluting industry whose regulation is actually now the EPA's primary public duty. This isn't some fringe question of conflict of interest about some question that may emerge. This is the biggest stinking conflict of interest I think we have ever seen in this body about the issue that is at the center of the Environmental Protection Agency's responsibilities. With the most important task before the EPA being to control carbon emissions before we push this planet over the climate cliff, the industry in question will now rule the regulator.  Well, this hits home. I have fishermen in Rhode Island who need honest environmental policy to protect our seas. ``It is not my grandfather's ocean,'' they have told me. ``Things are getting weird out there,'' people who have fished since childhood have told me.  Moreover, Rhode Island is a downwind State from the midwestern smoke stacks and a downstream State from out-of-state water pollution. Rhode Island needs a strong EPA to enforce clean air and clean water laws from harm starting outside our boundaries. My attorney general has not shut down his environmental unit, and my department of environmental management is doing our best to keep Rhode Island clean and livable. But they can't do much about out-of-state polluters. That is where the EPA comes in. For a man who so plainly disbelieves in and deprecates the EPA's mission, it is an alarming picture for Rhode  We are a coastal State, and a small one. We don't have a lot to give back to rising seas. I have to say, I am sick of having to comfort people whose homes have been washed away into the sea.  This is a picture I took not too long ago. Colleagues who have been here for a while might remember this individual. He was the Governor at the time, but he was my predecessor in my seat in the Senate, Lincoln His father served here with enormous distinction for many, many years and was actually a Republican chairman of the Environmental and Public Works Committee who cared about the environment. He was an environmental Republican leader.  These are houses that have washed into the sea as the result of a storm. Sea level rise has raised the level of the ocean so that storms throw their water farther in, and they take little houses like these that have been beachfront houses for many years and they just pull them into the ocean.  I spoke to the lady who I think owned that house. She was, I would say, in her seventies. She had childhood memories of that house. It had been her grandparents', and she would come to visit as a little girl. What she remembers as a little girl is that she would come out of that house, and in front of the house was a little lawn big enough to put up a net and play volleyball or badminton. Across from their lawn was a little road, just a sand-and-gravel road, but it allowed cars to come down and park near the beach. On the other side of the road was a little parking area where the cars could pull in. Beyond the lawn and the road and the parking area was the beach. Her memories of the beach were of sunny days with the sun beating down on the sand, and she would get across the lawn and across the road and across the parking lot, and then she would just have to scamper as fast as she could on her little feet across the hot sand. She described to me remembering what a long run that felt like for her to rush down to the ocean where she could put her feet into the cool Atlantic waters and swim. That beach, that parking area, that road, that lawn, and now her house are all gone. These are the things that are happening in my State that the Republicans in this building could not care less about--could not care less about.  The math is obvious: When you add heat into the atmosphere, the ocean absorbs the heat. Indeed, the ocean has absorbed almost all of the heat of climate change. God bless the oceans because if it weren't for them, we wouldn't be worried about hitting 2 degrees' increase in temperature. We would be worried about hitting 30 degrees' increase in global temperature. Because of all the heat that has been piled up, it has gone into the oceans 93.4 percent. That is like setting off more than two Hiroshima nuclear bombs in the ocean every second. Every second.  Think of the heat of a nuclear explosion of the level that destroyed Think of the--whatever it would be--terajoule of heat energy that gets set off by a nuclear explosion. Our oceans are absorbing heat. If we measure over the last 20 years how much heat they have absorbed, they are absorbing heat at the rate of multiple Hiroshima nuclear explosions happening in the ocean every second for 20 years.  We wonder why Senator Cantwell was talking about strange things going on in the oceans. We wonder why my fishermen are saying it is getting weird out there. But when all that heat goes into the oceans, there is a law called the law of thermal expansion. That is not the kind of law we debate around here. That is one of nature's laws. That is one of God's laws. That is one of the laws of physics and chemistry that we so ignore around here because we are paying attention to the laws of politics and the ``golden rule'': Who has the gold, rules.  But these are laws that we don't get to repeal or amend. What they are doing is swelling the seas with that heat. On top of that, in comes the water from melting glaciers and there is your sea level rise, 10 inches of sea level rise that we have measured at Naval Station Newport, to the point where we face scenes like this: a man in a kayak going down in front of the Seamen's Church Institute in Newport, This is not water in the ordinary course. This is a place where tourists walk. That is a storefront with water coming through the doorway. This was the storm surge, the tide, that came in with Sandy--which missed us, by the way.  We have a Coastal Resources Management Council that defends our shores, and our University of Rhode Island and Coastal Resources Management Council work together to see what is coming. They have developed new computer tools to determine which houses are going to be lost in what kind of storms, how often this scene is going to have to repeat itself in Rhode We are anticipating 9 feet of sea level rise by the end of this century.  My colleagues may think that is funny, that this is all sort of an amusing hoax we can talk about, but any State whose coasts are threatened with 9 feet of sea level rise, any representative of that State has a responsibility to come here and fight to try to defend that  When the adversary is the big special interests that is causing that and that has mounted the vast campaign of lies I talked about earlier to try to cover it--it is $700 billion in subsidies every year--then that is an adversary worth going after because that is a dirty and wrongful adversary.  When their representative is going to run the EPA, that is a disgusting state of affairs. If Rhode Island had to suffer this to save our country for some great goal, if Rhode Islanders had to go off to war again like my father and uncle and Rhode Islanders have since the first battles in Portsmouth, RI, the Revolutionary War, we would saddle up--sign us up--to take on whatever we need to defend this great country, but don't ask us to take a hit like this to protect a big special interest.  The arrogance and the greed of the fossil fuel industry and the dirty things it is willing to do to advance its interests knows no bounds. It lobbies Congress mercilessly against any action on climate change, and it has for years.  It runs a massive political electioneering operation of dark money and false attacks to prevent any action on climate change, and it has for years. It operates that giant array of front groups, a multi-tentacled, science-denial apparatus to put out streams of calculated misinformation. It does this all to protect what that International Monetary Fund report identified as a $700 billion annual subsidy.  What would big corporations do to protect $700 billion? Well, we are finding out. For years, the fossil fuel industry has been deliberately sabotaging[[Page S1337]]the honest and orderly operation of the legislative branch of America's government to protect its subsidy. With this appointment, it would be able to corrupt and sabotage the  I use the word ``corrupt'' because this is indeed the very definition of corruption in government. This is government corruption in plain view. In the Supreme Court decision Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce, here is how the U.Supreme Court described corruption. The Court described it as ``the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.''  Back we go to this network of false front operations, established by immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of a corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public support for the corporation's ideas.  We got some interesting polling recently. The George Mason University went out recently and conducted a poll of Trump voters. What did Trump voters think? It turns out that more than 6 in 10 Trump voters support taxing and/or regulating the pollution that causes global warming. In general, Trump voters were asked: Which of these two approaches to reducing the pollution that causes global warming do you prefer? Well, 16 percent said: I don't know; 21 percent said: Do nothing; but 13 percent of Trump voters said: Tax pollution; 18 percent said: Regulate pollution; and 31 percent said: Tax pollution and regulate pollution.  That adds up to more than 6 out of 10 Trump voters thinking that the pollution that causes climate change should be taxed or should be regulated or should be taxed and regulated.  When you go back to the Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce definition of corruption and look at the section that says that the policies pushed by the massive aggregations of wealth accumulated with the help of the corporate form want to go one way and the public wants to go another way and the corporate powers' views have little or no correlation to the public support for the corporation's political ideas, well, heck, we know Democrats support doing stuff about climate change.  It turns out Trump voters do too. The public is actually happy to get something done. It is this mess that is stopping us. It is groups that spend $700 million in a single election to influence Congress that is the problem, not the American public.  Teddy Roosevelt described corruption this way. He described corruption as a sinister alliance between crooked politics and crooked business, which he said has done more than anything else for the corruption of American life against the genuine rule of the people themselves.  If you look at the influence of Big Business--particularly the fossil fuel business--it has been something else around here. I was elected in 2006. I was sworn in, in the Senate, in 2007. When I was first here in those early years, there was a Republican climate bill floating around the Senate virtually all the time.  My recollection is that there were five Republican cosponsored climate bills during my time there. Susan Collins did a climate bill with Senator Cantwell; Senator John Warner of Virginia, Republican, did a bill with Senator Lieberman; Senator Graham worked on a bill with Senator Kerry; Senator Lamar Alexander had a bill of his own; and Senator McCain supported climate legislation and ran for President of the United States on a strong climate change platform. And then came 2010. Then came a decision called Citizens United, which the fossil fuel industry asked for, expected, and immediately acted on when it came out, and it said to the big special interests: Go for it, boys; spend all you want in politics. We five Republican appointees to the Supreme Court are going to make the comically false finding that nothing you can do with unlimited money could possibly ever corrupt American democracy or could possibly even be seen as corrupting by the American public.  Of course, that is such hogwash that right now the Supreme Court is viewed by people who have been polled on this question as not likely to give a human being a fair shake against a corporation.  If I remember correctly, the numbers were 54 to 6. In a polling group of 100, 6 Americans believe they could get a fair shot in the Supreme Court against corporations and 54 believed they could not get, as human beings, a fair shot in the U.Supreme Court against a big corporation, but with the big corporations at the Supreme Court, the fix was in--not a great place for the Court to be when by 9-to-1 American human beings think they can't get a fair shot in front of that Court against a corporation.  They did deliver, and they delivered Citizens United and opened the floodgates. The next thing out there was groups like Americans for Prosperity, the front group for the Koch brothers, Donors Trust, which launders away the identity of big corporations like ExxonMobil, and all of these other front groups we looked at earlier, and they are spending immense amounts of money. The result is, if there was a heartbeat of activity on climate change with Republicans before Citizens United, it has been a flat line since. That has been the story behind this.  Not only has dark money poisoned our conversation about climate change, this guy actually ran his own dark money operation. His Rule of Law Defense Fund, a 501(c)4 organization that does not disclose its donors have been linked to the Koch brothers, who run one of the biggest polluting operations in the country, but we don't really know. We don't really know. It has been kept absolutely quiet.  There is a black hole of secrecy around this nominee's dark money operation; whom he raised it from, what the quid pro quo was, what he did with it. Not allowed to know. Move along. Move along. It doesn't matter.  This is a test. This is a test of the Will this nominee ever tell us exactly what his relationship with the fossil fuel industry is? Will we get these emails in time to make an informed decision before his nomination is rammed through one step ahead of the emails that the judge said had to be released?  I can't get over the fact that this guy covered up the emails for 750-plus days for more than 2 years and a judge said: No, get them out And they are going to get them out The second chunk, you have 10 days to get them out. He sat there in our committee and acted as if this was some huge terrible task that he couldn't possibly get done; that with 2 years to do it, he couldn't get a single email out. By the time of our hearing, zero of those thousands of emails had come out. A judge took a look the same situation and said: Do it And they are doing it.  We have been so deliberately stonewalled, and it has been so painfully and plainly made clear by what the judge has ordered. We are not passing this test of how a Senate should act.  President-Elect Trump promised to restore genuine rule of the people themselves. Remember, Teddy Roosevelt's quote that the sinister alliance between crooked politics and crooked business has done more than anything else for the corruption of American life against the genuine rule of the people themselves. President Trump promised to restore genuine rule to people and themselves, and yet it is looking more and more like shadowy and industry-funded groups will really run our government.  This is a test also for the rest of corporate A lot of corporate America has good climate policy. Most of corporate America has good climate policy, but when are they going to stand up about an EPA Administrator who is the minion of the fossil fuel industry? What will Coca-Cola say to the Georgia Senators? What will Walmart ask of its Arkansas Senators? What will VF Corporation urge its North Carolina Senators to do? How will Rio Tinto advise its Senators from Arizona? All these companies have taken important stands on global warming. Why not now?  Let's talk about the due diligence that a nomination like this should get, particularly the due diligence about climate change that the present urgency demands. I wondered what due diligence my colleagues have done to[[Page S1338]]assess the reality of climate change before making this fateful and foul vote. The fossil fuel fox is on its way to the henhouse now, and I challenge the colleagues who will have put him there: Have you gone to your home State university for a briefing on climate science to understand what your own universities are teaching?  This nominee, Mr.Pruitt, never had. When we met in my office, he didn't even know who Berrien Moore was. Berrien Moore is the dean of the College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences at the University of He is a nationally renowned climate scientist. Before this nominee and I met in my office, for all this nominee's years of litigation against doing anything about climate change, he had never bothered to go to his own University of Oklahoma and find out from there, his home State expert, what climate change was, how it worked, and what it meant. Why not? The most logical answer is because he didn't care to know. He had already chosen sides and had been richly rewarded for doing so, although we don't know exactly how richly, since his dark money operation is still a secret, protected by the Senate Republicans who are shoving this nomination through.  Here is what Mr.Pruitt would have found out if he had bothered to go to the University of Oklahoma to ask the dean about climate change. The dean of the University of Oklahoma's College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences has said: ``On the increasing strength of earth sciences, we can now state that global warming is `unequivocal.' ''  The fact that the planet's warming and the fact that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and the fact that it is increasing in the atmosphere and that increases in the atmosphere due to humans--about those things? There is no debate.  He has said:       We know precisely how fast CO2 is going up in      the atmosphere. We have made a daily measurement of it since      1957. We have ice-core data before that.  He continued:       We know without any question, that it has increased almost      40 percent since the industrial revolution, and that increase      is due to human activity primarily fossil-fuel burning.  Those are the words of the dean at the University of Oklahoma, who is the expert in this subject. And Mr.Pruitt had never bothered to actually ever ask him. The fossil fuel industry had told him all he needed to know, and that is going to be a continuing problem with him as EPA  I thought to myself, have any of the Senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee, who voted for this nominee out of committee, done any better? Which Senator on that committee has been troubled to go for, say, half a day, to their own home State university and get a briefing on climate science? As I have said, this matters to Rhode Island because we are a downwind We have had bad air days where little kids and seniors and people with breathing difficulties are supposed to stay indoors in the air conditioning, not go outside. We are seeing warming rising, acidifying seas along our shores, hurting our fishermen, causing those families to lose those coastal homes I showed.  And the hits are just going to keep on coming. A child born today at Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, RI, can expect to see upward of 9 feet of sea level rise raging on Rhode Island shores in her lifetime, according to the University of Rhode Island and our State agencies.  Well, it seems to me the least a downwind State like Rhode Island might expect is some modicum of due diligence by colleagues who are blocking action on this subject. At the University of Rhode Island, the due diligence is very clear. URI is working with Rhode Island fishermen to help predict the harm from warming and acidifying seas and figure out what that means for our fisheries and our agriculture.  The Senator is from a State that has very distinguished fishing and agriculture himself, and I am sure his home State universities are doing similar research.  URI and our State agencies are drilling down to generate fine local data on sea level rise and storm surge, and we are starting to be able to predict, with specificity, which homes are likely to be lost in storms, which roads will become inaccessible in coming decades, what plan B is necessary to get emergency services to communities when flooding bars the way, and what water and sewer and other public infrastructure is at risk. These are all now the daily questions of Rhode Island coastal life, thanks to climate change, and our University of Rhode Island is at the forefront of studying that.  Of course, URI is not alone. You can go to every State university and find climate change concerns. They just understand this stuff. They are not actually just learning climate science, they are teaching about climate change. It is astonishing that Senators from those States will not listen to what their own universities teach.  Let's call the Republican roll of the Environment and Public Works Committee, all of whom voted to suspend the committee rules to jam this fossil fuel industry minion through to the Senate floor as Administrator of the EPA, notwithstanding the black hole of secrecy around his dark money dealings with the polluting fossil fuel industry, and notwithstanding his years of stonewalling dozens of Open Records Act requests, including the one that has just been ordered to be disclosed by the judge today--thousands of emails.  Let's see what our Environment and Public Works Committee colleagues, who cleared the way in committee for this nominee, would find at their home State universities, if they looked.  Chairman Barrasso could go to the University of Wyoming, where he would find the University of Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics reporting: ``Many of the most pressing issues facing the western United States hinge on the fate and transport of water and its response to diverse disturbances, including climate change.''  He would find University of Wyoming scientists publishing articles on ``The effects of projected climate change on forest fires' sustainability'' and the University of Wyoming awarding university grants to study the effects of climate change on pollinators, on water flow, on beaver habitat, and on whitebark pine growth, all work being done sincerely at the University of Wyoming on climate change.  Next down the line, we come to Senator Inhofe of The senior Senator from Oklahoma could also go, of course, and consult Dean Moore of the College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences at the University of But if he really wanted to dig in, he could also go over to Oklahoma State and get an update from Oklahoma State Professor Riley Dunlap, who has written in a peer review and scientific journal: ``Climate science has now firmly established that global warming is occurring, that human activities contribute to this warming, and that current and future warming portend negative impacts on both ecological and social systems.''  ``Portend negative impacts on both ecological and social systems''--that is science-ese for it is going to hurt people, as we Rhode Islanders already see all too plainly.  Oklahoma State's Professor Dunlap goes on to write something more. However, he goes on to say:       There has been an organized ``disinformation'' campaign . .      . to generate skepticism and denial . . . to ``manufacture      uncertainty,'' . . . especially by attacking climate science      and scientists.  Huh?  And he goes on:       This campaign has been waged by a loose coalition of      industrial (especially fossil fuels) interests and      conservative foundations and think tanks--  Look at that. He seems to be agreeing with Brulle at Drexel University--     that utilize a range of front groups and Astroturf operations      [to manufacture that uncertainty].  That is the research that Senator Inhofe would find at Oklahoma That organized disinformation campaign that Professor Dunlap reports on and the massive political muscle operation that supports it explains a lot of what goes on around here. And if you cross-reference the entities that Professor Dunlap puts into that organized disinformation campaign, you will find them on the record supporting this nominee. He is the nominee of the organized disinformation campaign. And that is because, behind this whole mess[[Page S1339]]of a nomination, is the fossil fuel industry.  Let's go back to the Environment and Public Works Committee and continue down the row on the majority side. We come next to Senator Senator Capito from West Virginia could go to West Virginia University, where the Mountaineers could show her their mountain hydrology laboratory, which tells us, ``Climate change has important implications for management of fresh water resources.'' These include, ``that the highlands region in the central Appalachian is expected to wet up.'' As warmer air, which carries more moisture, leads to what West Virginia University is calling ``intensification of the water cycle,'' the laboratory warns that, ``the implications of this intensification are immense.''  West Virginia University's Wildlife Conservation Lab publishes regularly on climate change effects, and one of West Virginia University's climate scientists, Professor Hessl, has been recognized by West Virginia University as West Virginia University's Benedum Distinguished West Virginia University even sends people all the way to China to study climate change. Some hoax.  My friend, Senator Boozman, is next in the line. His home State University of Arkansas has actually signed onto both the first and second university president's climate commitments. And the University of Arkansas has undertaken what it calls an aggressive and innovative Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help prevent climate change. The University of Arkansas explains the need to reduce greenhouse gases, particularly including carbon dioxide and methane. It is because these gases' ``absorption of solar radiation is responsible for the greenhouse effect.''  Explaining further, the University of Arkansas describes that the greenhouse effect ``occurs as these gases are trapped and held in the Earth's atmosphere, gradually increasing the temperature of the Earth's surface and air in the lower atmosphere.''  A University of Arkansas scientist predicts ``that the spread of plant species in nearly half the world's land areas could be affected by global warming by the end of the century.''  On down the EPW row is my friend Roger Wicker from Down in Mississippi, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, actually has an Office of The Ole Miss Office of Sustainability is there ``to further the university's efforts to combat global climate change.''  Believe it or not, Ole Miss is another signatory to that University Presidents' Climate Commitment just like It is moving toward net zero greenhouse gas emissions. By the way, so is the University of Southern The director of the University of Mississippi's Center for Hydroscience and Engineering explains why this matters.       Human influence and greenhouse gasses are the dominant      causes of the increase in global average temperature of the      earth. The impacts are observed in rising sea levels,      precipitation patterns, hydrologic regimes, floods and      droughts, and environmental processes.  He continues.       We must reduce our carbon footprint and take the necessary      steps to reduce our vulnerability to future climate change      impacts.  From the University of Also, at Ole Miss, anthropology professor Marcos Mendoza warns that ``climate change is the greatest environmental threat facing global society in the 21st century.'' Let me say that again--from Ole ``Climate change is the greatest environmental threat facing global society in the 21st century.'' But the fossil fuel machine is going to see to it that we put a climate denier into the EPA Administrator's seat.  So let's stay in Mississippi and go over to Mississippi State University, where several professors contributed to the American Society of Agronomy's report, ``Climate Change and Agriculture: Analysis of Potential International Impacts.'' The forward to that volume states that ``the threat of global climate change due to anthropogenic modification of the atmosphere--the so-called greenhouse effect--could potentially be one of the major environmental problems of our time.''  Down on the gulf, all three Mississippi universities are working together with Sea Grant, on what they call a climate team to assess ``the risk of environmental, economic, and societal impacts from rising sea levels and storm surges.'' My friend who is presiding knows well the effects in the gulf. When you are looking at the risk of environmental, economic, and societal impacts from rising sea levels and storm surges, you have something in common with Rhode Island as well.  Let's go on to Nebraska from where Senator Fischer hails. The University of Nebraska has published extensive reports on what they call ``Climate Change Implications for Nebraska.'' One University of Nebraska report leads with this blunt sentence: ``Climate change poses significant risks to Nebraska's economy, environment, and citizens.'' Well, Nebraskans, it turns out, agree. The University of Nebraska has published research that ``most rural Nebraskans believe the state should develop a plan for adopting to climate change, as do 58 percent of Nebraskans 65 and older.''  So even the elder Nebraskans by 58 percent believe it, and nearly 70 percent of young Nebraskans, from 19 to 29 years old. On the science, the University of Nebraska reports the following:       Is there debate within the scientific community with regard      to observed changes in climate and human activities as the      principal causal factor? The short answer here is no, at      least certainly not among climate scientists; that is,      scientists who have actual expertise in the study of climate      and climate change.  Let me repeat that again from the University of       Is there debate within the scientific community with regard      to observed changes in climate and human activities as the      principal causal factor? The short answer here is no, at      least certainly not among climate scientists; that is,      scientists who have actual expertise in the study of climate      and climate change.  The University of Nebraska goes on.       For more than a decade, there has been broad and      overwhelming consensus within the climate science community      that human-induced effects on climate change are both very      real and very large.  As to scope of those effects, the University of Nebraska warns:       The magnitude and rapidity of the projected changes in      climate are unprecedented. The implications of these changes      for the health of our planet and the legacy we will leave to      our children, our grandchildren, and future generations are      of vital concern.  The University of Nebraska has even published what it calls ``Key Climate Change Data for Nebraska.'' This is the list:  Temperatures have risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1895; frost-free season has increased 5 to 25 days since 1895; very heavy precipitation events have increased 16 percent in the Great Plains Region; projected temperature increase of 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit, low-emissions scenario, or 8 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit, high-emissions scenario, by 2100; projected summer of 2100 will have 13 to 25 days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; number of nights over 70 degrees Fahrenheit will increase by 20 to 40 by 2100; soil moisture is projected to decrease 5 to 10 percent by 2100; reduced snowpack in Rocky Mountains equals reduced streamflow in our rivers; increasing heavy precipitation events; increasing flood magnitude; increasing drought frequency and severity.  That is the University of Nebraska's list of coming attractions to Nebraska from climate change.  On to Kansas, where Senator Moran would learn from Kansas State University about climate change's effects on agriculture in his home Kansas State University Professor Charles Rice, Distinguished Professor of Agronomy, working with the National Science Foundation is using ``climate modeling tactics to predict the effects of climate change in the Great Plains, and to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies for agriculture in the region,'' to help meet what Kansas State calls ``one of the grand challenges of the 21st century: evaluating and predicting the biological and ecological consequences of accelerating global climate change.''  Kansas State brought the executive director of agricultural giant Cargill to talk about climate change. News reports describe what the Cargill executive stated; that ``climate change is real and must be addressed head-on to prevent future food shortages.'' Specifically, the Cargill executive said that ``U.production of corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton could decline[[Page S1340]]by 14 percent by mid-century and by as much as 42 percent by late century.'' This is a senior corporate executive in one of our leading agricultural companies, warning of a 14-percent decrease in these essential crops by midcentury, and as much as a 42-percent decrease by late century.  From an agricultural standpoint, the executive said, ``We have to prepare ourselves for a different climate than we have today.'' Maybe that is why Kansas State calls evaluating and predicting the biological and ecological consequences of accelerating global climate change one of the grand challenges of the 21st century.  Let's head out to South Dakota, where Senator Mike Rounds would hear from South Dakota State University about climate change on the Dakota South Dakota State's Leffler Lab calls climate change ``the signature challenge of the 21st century.'' So let's bear in mind, we have the Kansas State University calling climate change ``one of the grand challenges of the 21st century.'' We have South Dakota State's Leffler Lab calling climate change the ``signature challenge of the 21st century.'' We have an EPA nominee who is a climate change denier, wrapped so tight with the fossil fuel industry, you can't tell where one ends and the other begins, and he has the support of the Senators from Kansas and South  It is a riddle. South Dakota State scientists are not just saying that climate change is the signature challenge of the 21st century, they are out studying climate change around the globe. From the Upper Ghanaian forests of West Africa to the West Antarctica ice sheet. South Dakota State University Professor Mark Cochrane is working with the U.Forest Service to determine ``how a changing climate impacts forest ecosystems'' and reported that ``forest fire seasons worldwide increased by 18.7 percent due to more rain-free days and hotter temperatures.''  The South Dakota State University News Center has reported that season-shifting climate changes ``are all being affected by warming from an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activity''--``all being affected by warming from an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activity.''  South Dakota State University even brought in Harvard Professor and ``Merchants of Doubt'' author Naomi Oreskes, saying that her work ``has laid to rest the idea that there is significant disagreement in the scientific community about global warming.'' Somebody needs to translate between South Dakota State University and this EPA nominee.  So on we go to Iowa, continuing down the Environment and Public Works Republican roster, where Senator Joni Ernst could hear from an Iowa State University professor who told a United Nations conference not long ago that ``climate change was already affecting Iowa farmers. This is not just about the distant future,'' he said. Iowa State has published extensive reach and I will just quote the title of it. ``Global Warming: Impact of climate change on global agriculture.'' Iowa State's prestigious Leopold Center views climate change not merely as warming, but as a ``worsening destabilization of the planet's environmental systems.''  Climate change is not just warming, it is a ``worsening destabilization of the planet's environmental systems'' and yet the good Senator voted to move this climate-denying industry tool forward to be our EPA  A worsening destabilization of the planet's environmental systems, they call it, that will create ``an aggravated and unpredictable risk that will challenge the security of our agricultural and biological systems''--``aggravated and unpredictable risk that will challenge the security of our agricultural and biological systems.''  That is Iowa State talking. They conclude: ``The scientific evidence is clear that the magnitude of the changes ahead are greater, the rate much faster, and [the] duration of climatic destabilization will last much longer than once thought.''  Now we come to the end of the row of the Republicans on the Environment and Public Works  As an Alaskan, Senator Dan Sullivan would get double barrels from the University of Alaska, first about climate change and second about ocean acidification.  ``Alaska is already facing the impacts of climate change,'' the University of Alaska reports.  This question of ``facing the impacts of climate change'' matters enough to the University of Alaska that, on global warming, the university has stood up the Alaska Climate Science The Alaska Climate Science Center has been established to help understand ``the response of Alaska's ecosystems to a changing climate.''  The Alaska Climate Science Center of the University of Alaska is charting the recordbreaking, year-over-year warming in Alaska, analyzing temperature trends, and receiving awards for ``modeling and evaluating climate change impacts in the Arctic.''  ``One thing for sure,'' the center says, is that the climate ``will continue to change as a result of various natural and anthropogenic forcing mechanisms.''  Then there is the other climate change punch coming at Alaska, from the sea. In addition to its Alaska Climate Science Center, the University of Alaska is serious enough about this to have also stood up an Ocean Acidification Research Center to address what it calls ``growing concerns over increased acidity in the ocean and the impacts this phenomenon will have on Alaska's marine ecosystems''--``growing concerns over increased acidity in the ocean and the impacts this phenomenon will have on Alaska's marine ecosystems.''  Alaska's seafood industry is an enormous asset to Alaska's economy, and it depends on Alaska's marine ecosystems. Well, the University of Alaska's Ocean Acidification Research Center warns that ocean acidification ``has the potential to disrupt this industry from top to bottom''--``to disrupt this industry from top to bottom.''  The Ocean Acidification Research Center identifies the culprit of this phenomenon as ``the transport of CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean.''  Indeed, as we have loaded up the atmosphere with more and more CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, the ocean has actually absorbed chemically about a third of that  In addition to all that heat I mentioned earlier that the ocean had absorbed--more than 90 percent of the added heat--it actually absorbed one-third of the carbon dioxide. Of course, when carbon dioxide interacts with seawater, there is a change that takes place.  Indeed, why don't we see about doing a demonstration of that change. It will take a minute to get that organized. While we are getting that organized, let me continue.  Here is a description--thank you to the University of Maryland for the graphic--of how atmospheric carbon dioxide turns the ocean acidic.  When you add additional CO2 to the atmosphere, at the surface, where it meets the sea, there is a chemical exchange, and the CO2 can be absorbed by the ocean. As I said, one-third of it has been. That dissolved carbon dioxide joins with the water chemically, and it creates carbonic acid. The carbonic acid, in turn, creates bicarbonate ions, hydrogen ions, and carbonate ions, and those ions interfere with the makeup of marine creatures, which make their shells out of free carbon in the oceans, and some of those effects are pretty apparent.  This is the shell of an ocean creature called a pteropod. It is at the base of a great deal of the ocean food chain. There are studies off the northwest coast that show that more than 50 percent of this creature have experienced what the scientists who them caught them and studied them called severe shell damage. Here is what happens when you expose them to high concentrations of acidified seawater, higher than usual. That is what it looks like day 1. That is a healthy shell. Fifteen days later, it is starting to gray. Thirty days later, beyond just starting to gray, it is starting to actually come apart. And by 45 days, the shell is a wreck. That is not an animal that is capable of surviving.  So let's see how this works. This is a glass of water, and I have just put 20 drops of a pH test into it. That shows what the acidity is of the water. As you can see, it has turned the water rather blue, which matches roughly this level of pH.[[Page S1341]]  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to continue with this little demonstration.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy). Without objection, it is so ordered.

1105,topic-id,1393,"Mr.President, this is a very simple bubbler that anybody with an aquarium will recognize. All you simply do is you put the bubbler in. I produce carbon dioxide as I exhale. So I am exhaling one breath into this same glass. I will do one more. It was not even a full breath, but there it is.  It used to match that color; do you remember? Now look at what color it matches. Just breathing carbon dioxide through the water has changed its pH and has made it more acidic.  I can do that right here with a breath. It is happening on a global scale, as the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans transports CO2 into the oceans. When that happens, the same chemical effect that we modeled here takes place, and the oceans become more acidic, and the effects continue to be damaging.  The previous shell that I showed was the pteropod, a humble creature, but an important creature in the food chain. It is actually called the ocean butterfly by some because its snail foot has been transformed by God's law of evolution into an oceanic wing that allows it to fly in the seas.  This is an oyster. The Senator's State of Louisiana does a lot of work with oysters, as does Rhode Again, exposing oyster larvae to ocean water with heightened levels of acidity--day 1, day 2, day 4, and then we see exposure to acidity. Here is what a healthy larva looks like; here is what one exposed looks like. Here is what the healthy one looks like; here is what the exposed one looks like. Here is a healthy one; here is one exposed.  You will see that the healthy larva is growing day after day. It is getting bigger. It is going to become an oyster. Somebody is going to have a great oyster stew some day with that oyster with any luck.  This one is shrinking and deforming, and the reason is that the little creature is trying to take the carbon out of the ocean to make its shell--the calcium. And because of those ions that I pointed out, it is bound up, and they can't get it. So they deform this way.  When you are at a point where more than 50 percent of ocean pteropods are experiencing severe shell damage, if you are not paying attention, you are going to take a big punch.  Now I know around here we don't give a darn about God's creatures as being God's creatures. I probably sound funny to some people talking about a funny little creature in the ocean called a pteropod. The things we care about here are things that we can monetize because this is Mammon This is the temple where gold rules.  These little creatures are a little bit away from the gold. But who cares about the pteropod? I will tell you who cares about the pteropod. Salmon care about the pteropod, and people care about the salmon, and Alaska has a pretty good salmon fishery. The Pacific Northwest has a pretty good salmon fishery. If you drop out the pteropod from the bottom of the oceanic food chain because it can't grow because the ocean has acidified, there is a big collapse to take place.  As scientists would say, the upper trophic levels fall as the lower trophic levels collapse. So this is serious.  As I went through all these different Republican Environment and Public Works Committee Senators' home State universities, maybe you could say that all those home State universities are part of the climate change hoax that our President is so pleased to tweet about.  If so, my colleagues really ought to call their home State universities out about that. If they think their home State universities are in on a hoax, I think it wouldn't be right, and they ought to call out their home State universities. If the home State universities are part of a big old hoax, say so. Say so. But if all of my Republican colleagues' home State universities right down the line on the Environment and Public Works committee aren't in on a hoax, if what they are doing is good science, why not listen to them? Why not listen to them? What is the dark star in this firmament that causes the real science from the home State universities of these Senators to warp and twist around as it comes to this body? What is the power? What is the force that is causing every single one of these home State universities to be ignored by their home State Senators?  Let me go back and review very briefly what they said. Home State universities of the Republican Senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee warn of ``pressing issues'' related to climate change. That is Wyoming--pressing issues.  Assert that the science of climate change is ``unequivocal,'' ``without any question.'' That is from  Foresee ``immense'' implications related to climate change. That is West  Making anti-greenhouse gas ``climate commitments'' to fight climate change. That is the University of  Warn that ``climate change is the greatest environmental threat facing global society.'' That is  Find the ``significant risks'' from climate change to be ``of vital concern.'' That is That is the one that had the hit list of coming attractions from Nebraska of climate change  Describe climate change as ``one of the grand challenges of the 21st century.'' That is  Call climate change ``the signature challenge of the 21st century.'' South  Predict ``aggravated and unpredictable risk'' from climate disruption. That is  Prepare for fisheries risk that could shake the State's seafood industry ``from top to bottom.'' That is  Right down the row of Republican Senators who voted for this climate denying nominee, you have home State universities that say the opposite, that say that it is real, that it is beyond scientific debate at this point, that its effects are here, that its effects are worsening, and that it is going to shake industries like the fishing industry from top to bottom and create significant risk and disturbances in agriculture. But not one of those Senators stood up against the nominee who is the shameless tool of the industry that is causing all that harm.  So I have to ask, how does that end? If you listen to what all your home State universities are saying, this is a pressing and immense grand challenge. This greatest environmental threat--it doesn't go away. This is truth measured by science, God's and nature's truth, and truth always demands a reckoning.  If we listen only to the fossil fuel industry as it lies and prevaricates and propagandizes and disassembles and does all its nonsense to protect its all-important right to pollute for free, how do we expect this turns out in the end? Do you think these acidifying shells give a red hot damn what a fossil fuel industry lobbyist says? They are responding to laws of chemistry and nature that we don't get to repeal or amend.  Let me make one last point in closing, as I saw Senator Carper here, our distinguished ranking member, and I am sure he wants to speak.  Our Republican friends claim to support market economics. They are big on how you have to trust the market. You shouldn't regulate. Markets are the way to go. Market economics is the most efficient tool for allocating resources. Market economics are how we create wealth. Actually, I agree. So let's look at market economics.  What I believe and what economists say on all sides of the political spectrum is that it is market economics 101 that for the market to work, the harm of a product has to be built into the price of a product.  The fossil fuel industry, the dark star of our politics, absorbing and bending all of this home State information, absorbs and bends even conservative market principles so that they disappear here in Congress, at least wherever those principles conflict with what appears to be our first principle: the well-being and the power of the fossil fuel industry.  The fact that Senators do not hear or do not care about this science from their home State universities tells you all you need to know about the brute political force of the fossil fuel industry here in  (",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1823,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February

963,topic-id,962,"Mr.President, I am delighted to rise this afternoon in support of Scott Pruitt, nominated for EPA Administrator, and to congratulate the leadership of this Senate and the administration for persevering on this nomination to the point where we will get a vote tomorrow afternoon and I think be able to end the week on a positive note.  My good friend, the Senator from North Dakota, had just called for a good bipartisan day on the Senate floor, and I support many of the remarks she made in that regard. I would hope we could begin having some good bipartisan days with regard to the administration's nominations for these important positions.  Sadly, it looks as though we will not have a bipartisan vote for Scott He will be confirmed but not nearly with the vote he should receive from Members on both sides of the aisle who know that there has been extreme overreach on the part of the EPA leadership under the Obama administration. The EPA needs a change in direction, and they need to become more sensible with regard to stopping pollution, while at the same time being friendly on job creation. So we will get this nomination finished tomorrow and we will have a good Administrator, but regrettably it will not be on a very bipartisan basis.  This is the Scott Pruitt whom I have had a chance to learn about since he was nominated in  The Scott Pruitt I have had a chance to learn about took on the polluters as attorney general for his State of Oklahoma and finalized multistate agreements to limit pollution, and he did so working with Democrats and working with Republicans on a bipartisan basis across the political spectrum. I think we need that sort of person as EPA Scott Pruitt negotiated a water rights settlement with the tribes to preserve scenic lakes and rivers, and I think he is to be congratulated on that, not scolded. He stood up to oil companies and gas companies as attorney general for the State of Oklahoma and challenged them when they were polluting his State's air and water. Then--something I applaud--when the EPA overstepped its bounds and its mission and ceased to follow the law, he challenged the I submit to my colleagues that that is exactly the sort of balance we need to return to as Administrator of the  In the hearing, which was rather extraordinary because of its length, Attorney General Pruitt demonstrated his knowledge, he demonstrated his intellect, and he demonstrated his patience. He was available all day long--an extraordinarily long hearing--answered more than 200 questions propounded at the hearing, and then beyond that he has now answered more than 1,000 questions for the record. Yet, in spite of this, it is disappointing that some of my colleagues, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, have taken not only to disparaging his qualifications and his suitability for this position but also engaged in a slow-walking process designed to keep this nomination from even coming forward.  Every Democrat boycotted the committee meeting that was called to report this nomination to the floor so that we could even have an up-or-down vote. They walked out of the meeting. This is the sort of tactic we were able to overcome on a parliamentary basis, but it has given us what we now know is the slowest confirmation process in 225 years. The only President to have a slower confirmation process was the one who was getting it all kicked off to start with; George Washington's was a bit slower. We will see. Maybe if this keeps going, we could surpass the slowness of the confirmation process that occurred for our first  We need a change at The American people are ready for a change at We need an EPA Administrator who will listen to the environmentalists but also listen to the job creators.

That is what Scott Pruitt believes.  I would quote from a recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal which William McGurn wrote in support of Mr.Pruitt but also generally in support of other nominations. With regard to Pruitt, Mr.McGurn says this: ``The fierce opposition to Mr.Pruitt speaks to the progressive fear that he might help restore not only science to its rightful place but also federalism.'' I think that is what Scott Pruitt is going to be about when he is confirmed tomorrow and finally gets down to working for us, the taxpayers, as Administrator of  This is about the 1-month mark in this administration, and we are slowly getting past this unprecedented slow-walk effort by our colleagues. I certainly hope that with the 1,100 other appointments that have to be submitted and have to be spoken to by this Senate, we can hasten the process so we can pass legislation and be about the business our constituents sent us here to do.

797,topic-id,3514,"Mr.Speaker, we see so much on I was watching the President's press conference a little while ago. We see so much discord out there, and this opportunity that we have in the afternoon to really delve deep into the issues is so valuable to me. It is one of the only opportunities that the American people get to see us delving deeply into the issues.  You and I know that we are in the committee room, we are behind closed doors in a bipartisan way grappling with all of the hardest issues that face American families, but folks don't see it and they don't feel it. Why it is we celebrate the discord instead of celebrating the discourse is a mystery to me.  I bring, Mr.Speaker, today some stories about the Affordable Care Act from my district at home. It is not going to be a surprise to you that these are stories of challenges.  In Cumming, Georgia--it is up in Forsyth County, Georgia, just north of[[Page H1293]]Atlanta--I heard from a single mom. She has two kids, ages 11 and 13. They have a family physician that they want to hang on to.  She says: I work part-time as a paralegal. I earn $25,000 a year, and I also receive child support payments.  She said that she was encouraged by a health insurance company to go out and enroll in Medicaid instead, but neither of her children's doctors accept  How often do we hear that?  The solution for everything is to dump everyone into Medicaid is not a healthcare system. It is a healthcare payment system. You have to find a doctor who will accept a payment. This young woman's doctors do not.  She said she went on healthcare.gov, filled out an application, and was offered a plan for $464 a month with a $12,600 deductible. She makes $25,000 a year, and what we have offered her is a $500-a-month policy, $464 a month, with a $12,000 deductible. That is not affordable, she said. She called an insurance broker and looked for a similar policy. They were priced the same way.  She said: I have decided to pay the ObamaCare fines instead.  Mr.Speaker, I tell this story because I know that every single Member of this body wants to serve the constituency that sent them here. Every single Member of this body wants to find solutions for folks back home.  As we look at the numbers across the country, we find that more Americans that we purported to help with the Affordable Care Act have decided to pay a fine instead of join the exchange system.  Mr.Speaker, we have more Americans opting out of the system than opting into the system because we have failed those very people we purported to help.  From Buford, Georgia, Mr.Speaker: I'm a full-time student with a part-time job that doesn't offer health or dental insurance. I can't get health insurance through my parents because they are on I shopped for health plans, but all of the ones on the exchange are out of my budget. I shouldn't have to pay a fine because I can't afford health care.  Now, think about that, Mr.This young student says: I shouldn't have to pay a fine because I can't afford the health care. If I can't afford the health care, I certainly can't afford the fine.  These are the people that we purported to help with the Affordable Care Act, and they are not being served.  Back in Cumming, Georgia, Mr.Speaker: Today I have been in my office for hours trying to find affordable health care that accommodates my primary care physician. Prices start for me at $750-plus. Before ObamaCare, I was paying $365 with more access to doctors.  It is not just about the money, Mr.These networks, as you know, are closing. More than one-third of the counties in America have no choice of insurance whatsoever. The networks are narrowing. Folks are not just finding it hard to pay for care, but they are finding it hard to choose their physician.  A retired couple in Peachtree Corners, Mr.Speaker: I retired last year, and my husband retired this year. Both of us are in our sixties. We knew we would have to pay a lot for health insurance, but I was stunned when we signed up for the Affordable Care Act to the tune of more than $1,200 per month. I recently received a notice from our insurer that premiums for 2017 will go to over $2,000 per month.  This family played by the rules their entire life, Mr.They retired, needed access to health care, and went to the exchanges that were purported to help people find affordable health care. They found a $1,200-a-month policy that this year rises to $2,000 a month.  I say this to the young people planning for their retirement and thinking about putting something away for a rainy day: This couple pays $2,000 a month simply for their premium.  Another family in Cumming, Georgia, Mr.Speaker: Six years ago, we had a perfectly acceptable high-deductible plan with an HSA for $300 a month. As ObamaCare has been implemented, it has gone from $300 to $450 to $950 per month, and our only remaining option is a $1,450-per-month plan that provides effectively the same coverage.  Mr.Speaker, I added that one because these folks weren't looking for help. These folks weren't uninsured. These folks didn't have a problem finding insurance. They had it under control themselves. In the name of helping the uninsured, the Affordable Care Act came in, re-regulated the entire insurance industry, even for people who already had health care, and drove this family's premiums from $300 a month to $1,400 a month.  Mr.Speaker, who defends these things? Who defends these things?  I tell you, I will not have a colleague from the Democratic side or the Republican side who would say that any of these consequences were intended when the Affordable Care Act was passed. They might have been inevitable, but they were not intended.  So we can agree there is a problem. We can agree there is a problem. And if you don't think that we can agree, let me refer first to former President Barack Just last fall, he said this: Despite this progress, too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles or pay their monthly insurance bills. They struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering system, and they remain uninsured.  That's right. They remain uninsured. The trillion-plus dollars that we spent to solve the issue of the uninsured solved nothing. We continue to have a problem with the uninsured, yet we have added problems to those who are insured.  Democratic Governor Mark Dayton from Minnesota in October of last year, Mr.Speaker: The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.  The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable--these are words of folks who supported the Affordable Care  Former President Bill Clinton: ``So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled with their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.''  There is a group of people, mostly small-business owners and employees, who make just a little too much to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can't get Affordable Care Act premiums in a lot of places.  Former President Bill Clinton says that there are guys out there busting 60 hours a week trying to make it work for their families, and we have failed them.  It is not that they had a problem to begin with. Many of these folks had insurance that they liked to begin with. We failed them when we re-regulated them into problems instead of solving problems.  Mr.Speaker, the broken promises began right away. You will remember the fact check organization that named ``If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan'' as the Lie of the  Overpromising and underdelivering has been the nature of We were promised premiums would decline by $2,500. The average family premium has increased by $4,300. We were promised the cost of health care would go down, but deductibles have risen more than 60 percent. We were promised you can keep your doctor, but 70 percent of us find ourselves in narrower networks today than we did before. Middle class Americans were promised we wouldn't see a tax increase, but as we just heard from this young student, when you can't find a plan that meets your needs, then you are fined by the You are paying taxes right then.  Now, Mr.Speaker, I am not blaming these systemic problems on President I am not blaming these systemic problems on the Affordable Care What I am doing is pointing out that we passed the Affordable Care Act with $1 trillion in new tax increases and with a re-regulation of all of the insurance plans that people liked before in the name of solving these problems, which we did not solve.  I will take you to my home State of Georgia, Mr.On average, 32 percent is the increase that we are seeing in premiums on our exchange--32 percent this year alone. Of the folks[[Page H1294]]who are participating in the exchange, Mr.Speaker, 80 percent of them receive a government subsidy.  Let me say that again: Of the folks who participate in the $1 trillion Affordable Care Act exchange program in the State of Georgia, 80 percent of them do so because the government is paying for their health care. That is a pretty good incentive to get in the system. If you're going to get a subsidy payment, folks are in the system. Eighty percent require that subsidy in order to be enticed into the system.  As you know, Mr.Speaker, more people rejected going into the system opting instead for no health care than went into the system with the Affordable Care  The average wage earner in Georgia, Mr.Speaker, gets no subsidy from the government. Four hundred percent of the poverty line, as you know, is where that subsidy kicks in. That is about $48,000 a year in the State of I am telling you, if you earn $48,000 a year, you have bills, obligations, and responsibilities, and you find yourself in one of these $2,000-a-month premium situations that this retired couple in Georgia did, you cannot afford health insurance--or at least you cannot afford the health insurance that the government today is requiring that you have.  Let's think about those requirements, Mr.The government, in its wisdom, decided it was going to force folks into plans that it deemed appropriate. Many of those came in the form of healthcare CO-It was certainly a reasonable idea: let's allow folks in States back home to join together and provide health insurance.  We sucked folks into those CO-OPs, Mr.Again, an unsustainable system, this death spiral of One million folks were sucked into CO-OPs that went belly up, Mr.They lost their insurance once when ObamaCare came into business, and they lost their insurance again when these CO-OPs failed.  As you can see on this map, the orange CO-OPs have failed. Only a few remain in business today. It remains to be seen if they will make it through the year.  When we talk about choice, Mr.Speaker, five States have only one insurer in the exchange. That was the whole point of the exchange. That is why we spent literally billions upon billions to set up these exchanges so that consumers could compare and choose.  Now, two things went wrong. Number one, we set up this list of mandates that every insurance plan had to comply with, which disincentivized folks to join those plans to begin with. Then, number two, by setting up what you had to have in a plan, you, by definition, restricted the choice of individuals to choose what they want. So you end up with five States with only one insurer under  Now, that is before the announcement this week from Humana that it is withdrawing from all of the ObamaCare plans at the end of 2017. That was before the announcement this week from the Aetna CEO that he sees the death spiral that ObamaCare is involved in--his words--and it remains to be seen whether they will participate next year or not.  I don't need to find consensus among 218 Members or even 435 Members about whether or not ObamaCare is succeeding or failing.                              {time}  1745  What I need is for folks to look at the 19 million uninsured Americans who had an opportunity to go into this trillion-dollar system; an opportunity to reach for the golden ring, as it was described by its authors and its proponents, and they said: They said: It doesn't work for me. They said: It is not the right thing for me. They said: It doesn't fit into my families' needs and desires and expectations.  Of these 19 million, Mr.Speaker, 6.5 million paid a tax penalty. That is 6.5 million Americans failed by their government in a trillion-dollar healthcare regulation, failed by their government in an expansion through ObamaCare and Medicaid, and failed by their government yet again when they received a bill because the trillion-dollar program we put together didn't work for them and their families.  Can't we agree that if our goal was to solve the problem of the uninsured American, having 19 million Americans who would rather stay uninsured than participate in the Affordable Care Act is the definition of failure?  We can do better. There is a better way, Mr.Speaker, let there be no mistake about that.  I know there is a lot of anxiety out there. I don't want to minimize that. Fear is a corrosive emotion to have. I want to do my very best to allay the fear of anyone in America, Mr.Speaker, who is benefiting from the Affordable Care As these numbers have demonstrated, there are not many. But if you spend a trillion dollars and re-regulate an entire industry, I certainly hope there is at least one family out there who got something out of it. I know that there are.  I quote Greg Walden, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr.Speaker, who, as you know, has wide jurisdiction for re-regulating health care. He says this in January of this year: ``We want to make sure that people with pre-existing conditions continue to get covered.''  Mr.Speaker, it is a myth that Congress didn't care about preexisting conditions. It was Republicans in Congress, led by Republican Newt Gingrich of the great State of Georgia, who abolished preexisting conditions in every federally regulated plan back in 1996. He did that in partnership with Bill  What you have heard from our chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee is that we are committed to dealing with preexisting conditions. Take that anxiety off your list.  From Tom Price, now the Secretary of Health and Human Services: ``Nobody is interested in pulling the rug out from anybody.''  We believe that it is absolutely imperative that individuals who have health care be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunity for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and their families.  There has been a lot of talk about individuals losing health care. That is not our goal, nor is it our desire, nor is it our plan. The new Secretary of Health and Human Services said that this year.  Now, Mr.Speaker, I don't want to overpromise and underdeliver. ObamaCare is failing. The exchanges are failing. Insurance companies are leaving. Plans are being canceled.  I am not saying that if you like your plan, you can keep it. Your plan may be one of the overly regulated, overly priced plans that is collapsing across this country. What I am saying to you is, our commitment is to help and not hurt in that area.  I cannot prevent ObamaCare from failing. I cannot prevent your plan from going away, but I can provide an off ramp for you and your family so that you can find, as Secretary Price says, better choices and better opportunities.  From the United States Senate, Mr.Speaker, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: ``There will be a stable transition period, and once repeal is passed we will turn to replacement policies that cost less and work better than what we have now.''  Some contend that, by fulfilling our promise to the American people, we are somehow going to go back to the way things were before ObamaCare, which we all know is untrue.  If your family grappled with preexisting conditions because your State didn't address it the same way the Federal Government did back in 1996--folks are committed, if you are playing by the rules, to stick with you and your family through this transition.  If your family benefits from the raising of the lifetime caps that was a part of the Affordable Care Act, you have won that debate. You needn't worry as we go through this transition.  If you like the fact that your kids are unemployed and staying on your policy until they are 26 years old, I think you have won that debate. I think that is absolutely going to be a part of that conversation in this transition.  If you have a fear, if you have a worry, if you have a concern, I don't want to minimize it. I want to allay it. But come and share it with your Member of Congress, share it with your United States We have a group of leaders committed to addressing those concerns.  Finally, Paul Ryan, our Speaker of the House: ``We can and should have a[[Page H1295]]system in this country where everybody can have access to affordable health care, including people with pre-existing conditions.''  There are things that unite us in this body, and one of those things is caring for people, caring about people, wanting folks to get a fair shake. If you have played by the rules, you deserve a fair shake. That brings us all together in this institution.  I don't want any family to find themselves in fear that they are being forgotten in this transition, but there is a very real fear that, if you are in an Affordable Care Act plan today, that plan will fail.  Mr.Speaker, there are two things we can do. We can pretend that failure is not imminent. You can look at all the insurers withdrawing from ObamaCare, you can look at all of the rate increases going up in double digits, you can look at all of the folks who are opting out because it has gotten too expensive and doesn't serve their families' needs.  You can see the failure of But the number of options that we have, the number of plans under discussion to replace it is numerous, Mr.We have got the Better Way healthcare plan, we have got the American Health Care Reform Act, we have got the Empowering Patients First, we have got our Rules Committee chairman's The World's Great Healthcare Plan Act, the Patient Freedom Act, the ObamaCare Replacement  Mr.Speaker, we have options. To begin to get to those options, we need to be honest with ourselves, whether we opposed ObamaCare from the beginning or whether we hoped it was going to be the best thing since sliced bread, that ObamaCare has failed.  With that recognition, we can repeal those costly mandates, we can repeal those constrictive agreements, we can repeal those things that have isolated us from choice, that have separated us from our doctors, and we can begin to restore a patient-centered, family first system.  Mr.Speaker, I have no doubt that you are a smart man. I have no doubt that you work hard from dawn to dusk every day. But no matter how hard you work, I promise you that you will not know better than the families in my district which healthcare plan is best for them, and I appreciate you not trying to second guess them.  I cannot make everybody in America happy, Mr.Speaker, but I can give everybody in America the choice to make themselves happy. I can't empower families in America to make their own choices, their own decisions about what works best for them.  Put your mind at ease. For folks who have concerns, we hear you. For folks who have been hurt, we are coming for you. And for folks who know there is a better way, we stand with you.  It is going to be a long spring and summer, Mr.Speaker, because this is only heavy lifting, but it is the right thing to do, and we have got the right group of men and women here to do it.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1292.txt,2008,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February
220,topic-id,1265,"Mr.President, I listened carefully to my colleagues on the[[Page S1146]]other side, and I want to make sure people really understand what this debate is all about. This debate is about background checks. It is about mental health. It is not about taking away constitutional rights. I am struck--and I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has taken part in a lot of these debates as well--that whenever there is a discussion about guns in the U.Senate, Senators get up and say: We shouldn't be debating guns, we ought to be debating mental health. That is what we are talking about today--mental health and background checks.  The fact is, we can go into townhall meetings in any part of America and hear extraordinary support for the whole idea of background checks. Background checks are right at the heart of this morning's debate and supporting background checks is not some extreme far-out position to hold. In fact, opposing background checks is the view that is way out of the mainstream of American political thought.  A recent poll found that 92 percent of gun owners supported expanded background checks. Let me just repeat that 92 percent of gun owners in America support expanded background checks. As the courts continue to interpret the language of the Second Amendment, one matter has been made clear: background checks are a constitutional part of the exercise of those rights.  So what I am going to do is describe what this is all about, but I want to, as we get going, make sure people understand that fundamentally this is about background checks, and it is about mental health. It is not about taking away somebody's constitutional rights.  Here is how the proposal under discussion works. If there is an individual with a severe mental impairment that means that another person--perhaps a family member--is in charge of their Social Security benefits, then the background check is to be informed by Social Security that the person with a severe mental impairment is ineligible to buy a gun. The fact is, we can always talk about tailoring the rule in a slightly different way. It is critically important that individuals who wind up in the background check system are not treated unfairly, but the fact is, anyone who thinks they have been unfairly affected by this proposal can appeal, and they are most likely going to win, as long as they are not a danger to themselves or anyone else. If the Social Security Administration says no, that person has the power to take their case to court.  What we are talking about here is, in my view, not about Democrats or Republicans, liberals and conservatives; I think we are just talking about plain old, unvarnished common sense. We want to, all of us--all of us--stop shootings by those who are in danger of hurting themselves or other persons.  The rule came out last year, but it goes back to the shootings at Virginia Tech and Sandy What the previous administration sought to do was to find some commonsense gun safety steps that could be taken under laws on the books. I want to emphasize this as well because whenever we talk about guns, what Senators always say is: Let's use the laws on the books. Let's use the laws on the books. We don't need to chase new laws and the like.  So the administration sought to use the laws on the books--the previous administration--to prevent the horrendous acts of violence that have so scarred our country in recent years. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer knows something about that from his own  I hope my colleagues will oppose the resolution. I think we are all aware in the Senate that whenever you have an issue that even touches on guns, everybody goes into their corners. They go into their respective corners.  My own view is--and I represent a State with a great many gun owners. I have had more than 750 townhall meetings at home. A lot of them--a lot of them--involve debates about guns. Overwhelmingly, in a State like mine, where there are a lot of gun owners, gun owners support making sure there are background checks. They want to address this as a mental health issue. Gun owners overwhelmingly say they have just had it with Congress doing absolutely nothing when it comes to practical, commonsense gun measures like background checks. They look at what goes on in Washington, DC--and I have had so many gun owners--and this comes up not just at town meetings. We have an icon in our State, Fred Meyer, a store. I think I have had chicken in every Fred Meyer in the State of People come up and talk about issues like this in a Fred Meyer, and they ask: Why in the world can't there be Democrats and Republicans who just come together and do something that helps make our country a little bit safer? That is what this is all about.  I am not here to say this measure is a panacea; that somehow this is a magical elixir that is going to reduce gun violence in That wouldn't be right and certainly not part of how I see these debates. I see this as addressing a commonsense, practical measure relating to background checks and mental health.  I listened to my colleague, my friend from the Finance Committee, Senator If Members of the Senate feel so strongly that this particular rule needs addressing, then there ought to be a debate. The Senate, Democrats and Republicans, should get together and figure out how to improve the rule.  What is important is that is not going to be possible if this resolution passes. If this rule is struck down under the Congressional Review Act, it wouldn't just scrap this particular background check, it would salt the It would prevent this issue from being addressed for quite a number of years.  I am going to close by talking a bit personally for a minute about why I feel so strongly about this. My late brother Jeff, who passed at the age of 51, suffered from schizophrenia, a serious mental impairment. He started to withdraw in his teens. His condition got worse over the next few years. We were close. He was just a couple of years younger than I watched the continuing odyssey that Jeff went through of various mental health facilities, run-ins with the law on the streets.  I will say to the Presiding Officer that not a day went by in the Wyden household when we weren't worried that Jeff was going to hurt himself or somebody else. That was the reality for the Wyden family, and that is a fear that I know is felt in households all across the country, day in and day out.  My brother received benefits from public programs while he struggled with a mental impairment. My dad wrote a book about it because we were so hopeful at one time. He wrote a book called ``Conquering Schizophrenia.'' We thought there was a breakthrough drug known as olanzapine.  We always felt during those years that it would be a big mistake if Jeff Wyden could buy a gun. He would have been a danger to himself. He would have been a danger to others. I don't think Americans should have to carry that burden and experience that kind of worry that comes along with the danger we felt week after week for years in the Wyden household and that I know other families across the country feel as well.

531,topic-id,535,"Mr.President, whenever the discussion in the Senate turns to gun violence, we often hear Senators say: We shouldn't be talking about guns; we ought to be talking about mental health. That is exactly what we are trying to make sure is the focus of this debate because this proposed rule is about mental health, and it is about background checks; it is not about taking away anyone's constitutional rights.  Here is how the proposal works. If there is an individual with a severe mental impairment--that means that another person, perhaps a family member--is in charge of their Social Security benefits, then the background check is to be informed by Social Security that the person with a severe mental impairment is ineligible to buy a gun.  Having listened to the debate yesterday, I think everybody is going to be a little confused about what happens then because the reality is that anyone who thinks they have been unfairly affected can appeal, and the likelihood is substantial that they are going to win. If the appeal goes the other way and the individual believes the decision is wrong, then that person can take the matter to court. It is not true to say this rule deprives any American of due process. It is a rule aimed directly at the two areas in this debate--mental health and background checks--where there is enormous support from the American people.  The reality is you can talk to people in virtually any community--you can go to a townhall meeting in any part of the United States--and you will hear enormous support for background checks. One recent poll found that 92 percent of gun owners supported expanded background checks. Ninety-two percent of gun owners supported background checks. So not only is the position I am articulating not extreme, opposing background checks is the position that, in fact, has become increasingly out of the mainstream.  As the courts continue to interpret the language of the Second Amendment, one matter has been clear: Background checks are a constitutional part of the exercise of those rights.  I have heard some saying that the rule can be improved, that it ought to be tailored. I am very open to having a debate around those kinds of questions. That is not going to be possible if this resolution passes. This will preempt debate. The resolution doesn't just scrap the rule, it blocks any further step on this issue for years. In my view, that would be the wrong way to go, even if you have suggestions for improving the rule.  So to wrap up the debate, I want colleagues to know that this rule, this proposal that has been described on the floor--this resolution--ought to be opposed because for those who want improved mental health, for those who want background checks, for those who are just saying what we need to do in this area as it relates to gun violence--it is not about Democrats and it is not about Republicans; it is about common sense. The commonsense position today for background checks, a focus on mental health, and, most importantly, common sense is to oppose the resolution.  I yield the floor.

566,topic-id,1633,"Mr.President, I think Senator Murray has said it very well, and I want to pick up on what I think is really at stake with this nomination. In effect, if confirmed, Congressman Mulvaney would be the numbers guy for the Trump team, the architect for the President's fiscal plan for the Nation's future.  I want to start by way of saying that, when you look at the President's promises that he made on the campaign trail to protect Medicare and Social Security from draconian cuts, Congressman Mulvaney's nomination and his record would be one of the biggest bait-and-switch schemes inflicted on America's seniors that I can imagine.  I am going to start by taking a minute to read some of what the President said on the campaign trail. He said:       Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social      They want to do it on Medicare . . . and we can't      do that. It's not fair to the people.  The President said: ``It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is, not increase the age, but to leave it as-is.''  The President said:       You can't get rid of Medicare's a program that      works . . . people love Medicare and it's unfair to them. I'm      going to fix it and make it better, but I'm not going to cut      it.[[Page S1188]]  So those are just some of the promises that President Trump made with respect to Social Security and There are quotes like that from rallies and campaign events and debates over a period of some months. I think it would be fair to say that, for a lot of seniors, when they heard that--when they heard these promises that these vital programs would be protected--that was a political litmus test for many American older people. So I describe this contrast between the promises of President Trump and Candidate Trump and Congressman Mulvaney as a bait and switch, but I think the Senate needs to know a little bit more detail with respect to specifics.  In 2011 Congressman Mulvaney said: ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' He added in another interview: ``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' He proposed raising the Social Security age to 70. He called the program a Ponzi scheme. While he was a State lawmaker, he even voted to declare Social Security unconstitutional.  My sense is it will be a while before seniors get over the whiplash from the 180-degree turn the administration has pulled on Medicare and Social Security cuts.  Now, with respect to the days ahead, for me, a lot of this debate starts in my days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray The seniors that I worked with knew what those programs meant. It was their grandparents who faced old age without Social Those seniors with whom I worked during those Gray Panther days remember what happened before we had the safety net. Before there was Social Security and Medicare, you would have needy older people shunted off to poor farms and almshouses. Even if you had meager savings, you were on your own for income or you had to rely on family, and lots of family members were not exactly well off. If you came down with a serious illness, it really meant that you would be living in poverty and squalor. Social Security and Medicare changed those unacceptable terms of the social contract between this country and older people--and changed it for all time. Those programs were about saying that in America--for the older people who fought our wars, strengthened our communities day in and day out, made America a better place because they were always pitching in to help and be constructive--Medicare and Social Security meant that older people and seniors would not face a life of destitution.  That is why I believe every Member of this body--and I heard Senator Murray talk about this--ought to find what Congressman Mulvaney has said against Medicare--his anti-Medicare and anti-Social Security agenda--so troubling. I want to be very specific about the days ahead. Medicare, at its core, has always been a promise. It has been a promise of guaranteed benefits. It is not a voucher. It is not a slip of paper. It is a promise of guaranteed benefits. We made the judgment--I just went briefly through some of the history--because no one would ever know how healthy they would be when they reached age 65. We talked about it in the Budget Committee and in a number of meetings here in the I am definitely for updating the Medicare promise, updating the Medicare guarantee, and improving it, for example, to include chronic care services, cancer services, diabetes, services dealing with a whole host of chronic illnesses. That is going to consume much of the Medicare budget. We can have more home care and we can use telemedicine, and we can use nonphysician providers.  Senator Murray knows that in our part of the country we really have found a way to get people good quality care in an affordable way, but we are keeping the promise. We are keeping the promise of the Medicare guarantee.  Congressman Mulvaney would break the promise of If confirmed, he would join his former House colleague who just became Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price, who said in really very blunt terms over the years that he wanted to privatize the program. He wanted to privatize and cut the program. He basically indicated with his legislation that he didn't really believe in Medicare, and he didn't believe in the guarantee of services that Medicare provided. If you look at Congressman Mulvaney's record, it certainly indicates he shares the views of our former House colleague who just became Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom  With respect to Social Security, this year nearly 62 million Americans and their families count on receiving retirement, survivors, and disability benefits to stay afloat. This is a program that keeps tens of millions of seniors out of poverty. It is unquestionably one of the most popular programs in American history. It has changed the fabric of the country for the better.  Again, I think about the days when I worked with older people. We had millions of older people who month in and month out would just walk an economic tightrope. They would try to balance their food costs against their fuel costs and their fuel costs against their medical costs. Social Security and Medicare came along to make sure those older people wouldn't be pushed off that economic tightrope. So Social Security has changed the fabric of the country for the better without doubt, and yet Congressman Mulvaney proposes to raise the Social Security age to 70, which would be a 20 percent cut to benefits.  Let's picture what this means, particularly for the millions of older people who might not have had a job where they could work on their laptop, and they had a physical job. They worked hours and hours on their feet day in and day out. Ask the single mom who spent decades working multiple jobs that way to put food on the table and send her kids to school what it is going to mean to cut their benefits that way--or the loggers or the dock workers, the miners, and all of those people who have worked hard and have been on their feet with physically grueling work. Ask them about raising the Social Security age this way. I think you are going to get a pretty good sense of how strongly Americans oppose this kind of Mulvaney approach.  So by way of summing up, I think it would be hard to find a more significant task for the Congress at this time than protecting Social Security and Medicare, advocating for the two as great achievements in the history of American policymaking. They are right at the center of our safety net.  Now you have to give Congressman Mulvaney credit for one thing. He has been blunt, he has been explicit, and he is not shy about essentially his vision of hollowing these programs out and dismantling them. When asked about whether he was going to stick to his proposal to cut the programs, he said:       I have to imagine that the President knew what he was      getting when he asked me to fill this role. I would like to      think it is why he hired me.  That is why I say--and Senator Murray touched on this--what kind of a bait-and-switch game are we talking about here? You have the President--Candidate Trump--saying: Nothing doing; nobody is going to mess with Social Security and Medicare--off limits. I want older people in America to know they are going to be safe if they elect me.  It was almost like a litmus test for America's older people. Then Congressman Mulvaney comes along and he basically calls the bluff on the whole thing. He describes the bait and switch in very blunt terms, where he says: ``I have to imagine the President knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill this role''--that the President knew what the Mulvaney record was all about, which was about ending Medicare as we know it.  So I will just close by way of saying that I see that a big part of my job, and what Oregonians sent me here to do, is to defend Medicare and Social Security for generations of Americans to come. That is why I am a no on the Mulvaney nomination. I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February
609,topic-id,710,"Mr.President, today I, along with my colleagues Congressmen Chaffetz from Utah and Conyers from Michigan, am introducing the Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act, a bill that protects Americans from seeing their phones and other devices turned into location trackers without so much as a warrant or a warning. While law enforcement agencies can and have obtained, and should obtain, probable cause search warrants from a neutral judge authorizing them to track the location of Americans, in many other cases, government agencies obtain sensitive location information without a warrant. My colleagues, Mr.Chaffetz and Conyers, and I intend to fix that.  This is a situation where government agencies' use of new technology has gotten ahead of the laws in ways that would surprise many Federal, State, and local agencies routinely track Americans' locations through a variety of methods, most of the time without people knowing they are being tracked. Some tracking demands go directly from the government to phone companies. In the first 6 months of 2016, law enforcement agencies submitted at least 86,000 demands to telephone companies for subscriber location data. Some of these demands were for the records of hundreds or even thousands of customers at a time.  Law enforcement agencies also regularly track cell phones with the use of a surveillance technology known as a cell site simulator or A recent bipartisan report by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the House of Representatives found that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have spent more than $95 million to buy over 430 Although Federal agencies now obtain warrants before using this technology, many State and local agencies do not.  There is currently no uniform legal standard that regulates how Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies are able to spy on the location of Instead, there exists a confusing patchwork of State laws, policies adopted by law enforcement agencies, and legal precedents set by Federal and State courts. As a result, Americans in one part of the country may enjoy less privacy, based on the policies adopted by their local police department, privacy laws passed by their State legislatures, or the willingness of their phone provider to push back in court, than Americans who happen to live in a privacy-superior jurisdiction. This patchwork quilt of rules and regulations has led to confusion among law enforcement, prosecutors, and service providers, who waste valuable time and resources litigating and appealing what should be clear-cut rules--clear-cut rules that start from the premise that privacy is an inviolable right, not a convenience granted by local law enforcement.  Under President Obama, there was a policy in place that required Federal law enforcement officers to get a probable cause warrant before tracking an American's location. Under the current administration, we do not yet know if this policy will remain, which makes this bill even more critical.  This bill has three main components.  First, it requires the government to show probable cause and get a warrant before acquiring the geolocational information of a U.person, while setting out clear exceptions such as emergency or national security situations or cases of theft or fraud. This probable cause requirement would apply to all law enforcement acquisitions of the geolocational information of individual Americans without their knowledge. This requirement will include indirect location information acquisition from commercial service providers and direct acquisitions using Stingrays and similar devices, including tracking devices covertly installed by the government. This bill would regulate both real-time tracking of a person's movements, as well as the acquisition of records of past movements.  Second, the bill creates criminal penalties for secretly using an electronic device to track a person's movements that parallel those for wiretapping. Currently, if a woman's ex-husband taps her phone, he is breaking the law. This legislation would treat hacking her cell phone to track her movements as a similar offense.  Finally, it prohibits commercial service providers from sharing customers' geolocation information with outside entities without customer consent.  Passage of this bill would provide much needed privacy protections to Americans and ensure that location data is adequately protected from warrantless surveillance by law enforcement agencies.  I thank my colleagues Chaffetz and Conyers for their efforts on this bill, and I hope the Judiciary Committee will consider our proposal quickly.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1219.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February
1079,topic-id,559,"Mr.President, today I, along with 13 of my Senate colleagues, am introducing the Presidential Trade Transparency Act of 2017. This bill establishes new reporting requirements directing the President to disclose foreign income, assets, and liabilities when initiating or continuing trade or investment negotiations with a foreign country, taking or refraining to take certain trade enforcement actions, or granting or modifying preferential tariff treatment under statutory trade preference programs. Each of these decisions may have significant commercial implications, both as to a foreign country's economy as a whole and with respect to particular investments within a foreign country. Given the complexity and lack of transparency with respect to the President's finances, additional country-specific reporting is necessary for Congress to properly exercise its oversight responsibilities and assess whether the authority it has granted to the President is the subject of undue influence due to a business relationship between the President and one or more foreign entities. Reporting of this information will also help address questions regarding improper influence by foreign entities when the President exercises trade authorities granted by  Americans have a right to know if the President is looking out for the good of the country or just his own bottom line when he negotiates a trade deal, decides whether or not to enforce our trade laws, or decides whether to cut tariffs on imports from a developing country. The President has business interests around the world, but he continues to keep the full nature of those ties secret.  Under the Constitution, Congress is responsible for regulating foreign commerce, including setting U.tariff rates applicable to imports from foreign countries. However, Congress has granted the President limited authority to modify U.tariffs in certain circumstances, including to enforce U.laws protecting U.industry from harmful trade or to address foreign trade barriers, to negotiate trade agreements that eliminate foreign barriers to U.exports, and to grant developing countries preferential access to the U.market.  In many instances, the President himself is granted this authority and does not exercise it through a Cabinet official. While Congress has granted such authority to the President, it retains the responsibility to ensure that the President uses the authority in a manner consistent with congressional objectives.  The bill directs the President to report to Congress information regarding foreign income, assets, and liabilities, consistent with the information required to be disclosed under the Ethics in Government Act, specifically as to any country that is the subject of a trade negotiation, trade enforcement action or inaction, or decision to grant or deny tariff preferences, and to describe in detail the nature of the connection between the income, asset, or liability and the foreign country. The bill specifies deadlines for disclosure of the information with respect to each action that generally track existing deadlines for Presidential reporting under U.law.  Failure to timely submit a report would render without legal effect a Presidential proclamation modifying U.tariffs with respect to the country and, with respect to a trade agreement, would disqualify the agreement from eligibility for expedited consideration under trade promotion authority.  Passage of this bill would close a key loophole in congressional oversight authorities over trade and shine much needed daylight on the financial relationship between the President and America's trading partners.  I thank my colleagues for their efforts on this bill, and I hope the Finance Committee will consider our proposal quickly.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1306.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,16.0,February
1139,topic-id,1067,"Madam President, last month I stood here to express my serious concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the U.Environmental Protection  As the vote draws closer, I want to reiterate those concerns and give voice to the thousands of individuals and groups in Oregon who have sent letters and made calls and spoken up in my town hall meetings. Oregonians have expressed their fears that Pruitt will steer us into a ditch when it comes to protecting the environment and public health. I share their concerns, and I cannot support this nomination.  In my view, the importance of the EPA cannot be overstated. The EPA is[[Page S1371]]at the heart of maintaining clean air and clean water for every person in this country, but Mr.Pruitt has made a career of denying climate science, attempting to weaken or even get rid of worker protections, air quality standards for toxic air pollutants, and basic environmental standards. Those rollbacks would hurt us all.  One prime example of how the EPA has stepped in to protect Oregonians is during a recent air quality scare in In 2015, researchers with the U.Forest Service discovered that heavy metals including cadmium and arsenic had been emitted for decades into the air of Portland neighborhoods and schoolyards at dangerous levels.  I called on the EPA to take action, and within days they were on the ground in Portland, testing the air quality and helping our community wrap our heads around the public health risks. It wasn't long before they identified the root of the problem and corrected course.  I am not confident that a Pruitt EPA would have jumped to the aid of my community in a time when parents wondered if they had been poisoning their own children simply by feeding them vegetables grown in their backyards.  Mr.Pruitt's career is defined by repeated attempts to weaken or eliminate health-based environmental standards, weaken or eliminate limits on carbon emissions that would help address the challenge of climate change, weaken or eliminate air quality standards to fight the kinds of toxic air pollutants we saw in Those rollbacks hurt us all.  Mr.Pruitt has a history of attacking the very Agency he now wants to lead. As attorney general of Oklahoma, he has been involved in more than 20 lawsuits against the EPA, and he has failed to give Congress any kind of assurances that he would recuse himself from matters related to those lawsuits.  Mr.Pruitt has clear connections with big businesses who profit from polluting--oil and gas companies and coal-hungry electricity giants, among others. He has a history of siding with these special interests at the direct expense of the health of our families and communities.  According to news reports, as Oklahoma's Attorney General and head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, Pruitt helped raise millions from industries he is now expected to regulate.  More and more of this shadowy history is coming to light. Particularly after a judge has ordered him to release thousands of his emails as Oklahoma's Attorney General just days from now, the Senate should not hold a vote on a nominee when more information may come to light about an alarming association with the very industries he would be regulating as head of the  However, Mr.Pruitt has until next Tuesday to release those emails--4 days after Senate Republicans are forcing a confirmation vote. In the interest of transparency, the Senators should be able to read these emails before voting so we can make a fully informed decision.  By jamming this nomination through today, Senate Republican leadership is forcing the Senate to vote on a nominee without knowing the content of the full background of this nominee. In my view, that is legislative malpractice.  So I join my Democratic colleagues in asking that the vote on Mr.Pruitt's nomination to lead the EPA be delayed until those thousands of emails are released and Members of the Senate have the opportunity to review their contents.  The American people are demanding that Senate leadership delay Mr.Pruitt's confirmation until this important information is disclosed and questions about his possible conflicts of interest are answered.  On even the most basic level, Mr.Pruitt has a troubling history. He has denied the fundamental science that should be used to inform public policy.  Time and time again, Mr.Pruitt has argued against the reality of climate change, going so far as to dispute the EPA's rigorous science-based finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.  The EPA cannot be run by an individual with a career founded on alternative facts; yet that is much of what Scott Pruitt is promoting.  As I have said to Oregonians about this nomination and others, policymakers ought to come together and find the truth, not fall back on alternative facts.  Nearly 800 former employees of the U.Environmental Protection Agency expressed opposition to Pruitt this week in an open letter. These are 800 public servants who are dedicated to the Agency's core mission.  I think Oregonians and the American people need to hear what is in this letter. It states, in part:       Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that      requires EPA to set national standards attind gives states      latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum      criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that      Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no      matter where they live, and allows states to compete for      business without having to sacrifice public health or      environmental quality.       Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to      allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which      is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is      reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even      when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,      EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit      the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its      harmfulness to public health was erased. His action spared      much of the harm that some countries still face as result of      the devastating effects of lead on human health. Similarly,      early action to reduce exposure to fine particle pollution      helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from heart and      lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those risks did      not become apparent until much later.       Mr Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest      that he does not share the vision or agree with the      underlying principles of our environmental statutes.

1734,topic-id,535,"Mr.6 years ago this month, more than 100,000 Bahrainis of all ages and backgrounds joined together to protest their government. Although these men and women took to the streets peacefully, they were met with violence as the regime unleashed its state security forces. Using threats and intimidation, tear gas, live ammunition, and even torture, the regime brutally repressed the peaceful demonstrations. Following widespread international condemnation, the regime agreed to create an independent body to look into the crackdown and propose reforms--the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry or BICI--and when the BICI came back with 26 recommendations, the KING promised to urgently implement them all.  Six years later, the regime has not upheld that commitment. When our own State Department last reported on each BICI recommendation, it could only identify a handful that had been fully implemented--a far cry from the regime's claim of full implementation. The chairman of the BICI admitted last year that most recommendations have not been fully implemented. NGOs following these issues have been even more critical, noting with alarm that the regime has actually reversed BICI recommendations. Earlier this year, for example, the regime restored the power to arrest and detain Bahrainis to Bahrain's National Security Agency--a power that had been stripped following the BICI report's recommendation in 2011.  That decision follows a year in which the regime has moved aggressively to close the space for peaceful opposition. Since last February, the regime disbanded the largest opposition party, al-Wifaq, doubled the prison sentence of the party's leader, Sheikh Ali Salman, and detained numerous human rights advocates like Nabeel Rajab simply for speaking out. Advocates told my staff recently that the regime's escalating violence over the past year reached levels unseen since the 2011 protests.  The United States should not hesitate to raise its voice when foreign governments clamp down on speech and expression. This is even truer when the government in question is a U.ally, as the Bahrain regime is. I was disappointed that more administration officials did not appear to share this view with respect to Bahrain Indeed the State Department chose to lift self-imposed holds on weapons sales to Bahrain in 2015, a decision that I and many in the advocacy community saw as rewarding bad behavior and incentivizing more of it. In fact, I introduced bipartisan legislation last Congress that would have reinstated the ban on certain weapons sales until the administration could certify that the regime had implemented all 26 BICI recommendations. Congress adjourned last December without passing our bill, but I intend to resume my efforts this  As I sometimes remind my colleagues here, my goal here is neither to insult nor to undermine a U.ally. My hope is that someday I will be able to stop reading these statements into the record every February because the Bahraini regime has stopped repressing its citizens and has instead entered into a real and inclusive dialogue with them. Unfortunately, this regime has shown itself so unwilling to pursue dialogue and reconciliation that I must continue my calls for accountability. For that reason, I speak out today, on the sixth anniversary of the peaceful uprising, to call again for reform in Bahrain and an end to further oppression.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgS1494-2.txt,1247,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,28.0,February
312,topic-id,213,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the many veterans and the work that Congress is doing to support and represent them on the House floor this week. These are the heroes who keep us safe and secure each and every day.  This week, this body passed a few important bills to streamline access to care for veterans as well as provide new and better opportunities for veteran-owned businesses and veterans seeking employment.  Last month, the unemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans increased to 6.3 percent, marking the fourth time in the last 7 months that group's percentage has been higher than the overall veteran unemployment rate. That means that about 211,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are still looking for work. That is 211,000 too many.  That is why one of the bills we passed this week establishes a Federal program recognizing private businesses that employ veterans and engage in community service to help our veterans.  Mr.Speaker, helping our Nation's veterans who have sacrificed so much for us is a critical priority and remains one of the most important objectives of this I will continue to use my time and effort to fight for every opportunity to support them when they return home to give them the hero's welcome they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1192-5.txt,2021,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,15.0,February

347,topic-id,374,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.42, and I thank Chairman Smith for taking the lead in fighting for American workers with this commonsense piece of legislation.  I believe there has been a misconception about the intent of this Congress is not acting because we have a malicious intent to punish American workers. We are not even trying to disincentivize them from participating in the program.  My colleague, Mr.Davis, said we should strengthen our programs, and what we are attempting to do is exactly that: strengthen the system that is intended to help unemployed Americans and allow them to prepare to reenter the workforce.  The 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made commonsense reforms to the unemployment insurance system with the goal of assisting Americans in returning to gainful employment. Yes, this included allowing States, like my own of Florida, to determine whether or not they wanted to include drug screening and test unemployment insurance applicants. And, yes, the law specifically stated two conditions: if the applicant had lost their job due to drug use and if they were seeking a new job that regularly required new employees to pass a drug test.  Now, when the Department of Labor drafted the rule, they clearly went beyond the intent of Congress and tailored it too narrowly. This will only hurt prospective employees in the long term.  The rule covers occupations such as those that require the employees to carry firearms, flight crews, transportation, and the like.                              {time}  1400  The problem here is that employers in occupations outside of this narrow scope also regularly require drug testing of their employees.  So under this rule, unemployed Americans who are using and looking for employment outside of the specific occupations outlined in the rule could potentially find employment in a different industry, be drug tested, and subsequently terminated.  How is this helping American workers? It doesn't make sense to me, and it shouldn't make sense to any of my colleagues either. This is a bad rule, and it needs to be repealed so the Department of Labor can go back to the drawing board and craft a rule that will actually strengthen the unemployment insurance, help the American worker, and ultimately strengthen the economy.

1558,topic-id,536,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today not only to celebrate African American History Month, but to celebrate two stories lost to mainstream history. The first story is the original Underground Railroad, and the other story is of Josiah  Students across the country have heard stories about the Underground Railroad during the Antebellum Period; however, there was a Road to Freedom that existed before the United States was even established, and that road went south to the free territory of Spanish In fact, the National Park Service held its sixth annual Underground Railroad Conference in Augustine in 2012 to highlight this very story which started with eight recorded families seeking freedom in 1608 in  During this period, thousands of men, women, and children fled from the colonies of North Carolina, South Carolina, and These individuals headed to Florida to gain their freedom thanks to the Edict of 1693, which was issued by the then-Spanish Government that stated that any man, woman, or child who found their way to Spanish Florida would be granted freedom.  The people at the heart of this story are the Gullah Geechee who trace their lineage to West Once free in Florida, the Gullah Geechee people thrived, establishing communities, forts, and deep roots throughout Florida's Third Congressional District, roots that still can be felt today.  The second story is of Josiah He was a man who was born into slavery in 1842 in He worked as a slave. The Civil War broke out, and he was conscripted by the Confederate Army to serve as a cook in the Civil He got freed by the Union soldiers, served with the Union soldiers, and after the war, he moved to Florida to fight in the Seminole American wars. During that time period, the war ended, and he moved to Gainesville, Florida, where he became the first African-American mayor of our city where I come from.  During that time, he became a very successful businessperson. He was elected to the Florida Assembly, and then later he was elected to the U.Congress, serving in this very body here today. His elections got challenged, and he lost his role as a Representative in the He ran again the next year, won again, and served a full term. Then the third term he ran, he won again. His election got challenged by a Confederate soldier, and he lost his seat.  He went on to become a prominent businessman in north central Florida, owned a farm, and was very successful until the freeze of 1906, which put him out of business. He moved to Tallahassee and became a newspaper owner and printed a local newspaper.  He rose to prominence, but at his death, he was but a footnote in the histories not just of our State, but of our country. Here is a man that was born into slavery, rose to prominence, and was forgotten by history.  I tell these stories because these stories, like many stories in our early history, must never be forgotten and must be remembered by our history lest we repeat it. It must also be taught to our children so that they are inspired and they see themselves in the history books like these other folks.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1361.txt,2115,MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEMBRANCE OF KANSAS SHOOTING VICTIMS,2017.0,28.0,February

The United States is the greatest Nation in the world, and one of the reasons why is Brookhaven National Their science research is aggressively pursuing cures to illnesses, protecting our national security, and increasing our energy independence.  Imagine being able to witness a recreation of the very beginning of our universe, a replica of the primordial soup which once comprised all that had existed right before your very eyes. Also imagine that this very same equipment could be used to find cures to illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.  I am proud that Brookhaven National Laboratory is located in the greatest congressional district in America, the First Congressional District of New  For nearly three-quarters of a century, Brookhaven has stood as a world-class research center that conducts groundbreaking studies within the scientific community. Brookhaven asks the big questions that scientists have been researching for generations, and has allowed us to look into the building blocks of our world.  Between preservation of our ecosystem, studies on the environment, and researching new forms of sustainable energy, Brookhaven is a world leader in scientific research.  There is also incredible cultural and historical relevance of the site of Brookhaven National There was once a World War I Army training center called Camp Upton located where Brookhaven stands today. It was at this camp that Irving Berlin wrote ``God Bless America'' while serving in the U. Brookhaven is not only a local and regional treasure, but also a national asset. The machines in Brookhaven have been utilized by the most brilliant minds in America, from the scientists of MIT and Yale to the engineers at GE and  While there are 17 national labs across our great country, Brookhaven is a unique user facility which focuses in a number of disciplines, not limited to particle physics, chemical engineering, and systems engineering and integration.  In previous Congresses, critical funding has been provided in support of the ARPA-E program for several of Brookhaven's phenomenal projects on energy production and storage, and so much more.  There has been discussion in the past to cut funding for Brookhaven's nuclear physics program to levels that haven't been seen since 2008. This would be a mistake.  Brookhaven features some of the most important scientific efforts in the world, with assets like the National Synchrotron Light Source II, or NSLS-NSLS-II has allowed for incredible advancement in the research and development of super conductors, which have the potential to revolutionize energy consumption in the U.and save into the billions for the American people and American businesses.  Another program in need of our continued support is the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, or This multi-faceted machine is essential for studies on matter and has key practical applications, like figuring out[[Page H1132]]how to best protect our homeland using detector technology.  There is also the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer, or BLIP, which has been recently upgraded to advance the field of medical science. This upgrade allows BLIP to better diagnose and treat illnesses, including heart disease and many forms of cancer, such as leukemia and melanoma.  With Congress' continued support, there is limitless potential for needed discovery and advancement.  I thank the Speaker for allowing me to discuss this amazing national treasure.
