                       TRIBUTE TO DAVID RADCLIFFE

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 
tremendous service of David Radcliffe, who joined our staff as a 
Brookings fellow this year. David's expertise in defense, veterans, and 
homeland security issues was invaluable, helping to ensure we met the 
needs of Maryland. David came to our office with a wealth of policy 
knowledge from his civilian work at the Department of Defense and his 
military service as an Army Ranger. He not only adapted quickly to his 
work in the Senate, he helped define his role in a new office. His 
versatility, kindness, and equanimity endeared him to constituents 
across the State. David was unfazed by any change in plans or new last-
minute requests, simply responding, ``Semper Gumby''--always be 
flexible. His strong principles, willingness to pitch in wherever 
needed, and sense of humor made him a great colleague and terrific 
staffer in my office. We owe him a debt of gratitude, and we will miss 
him greatly. My whole staff and I wish him well as he embarks on his 
next journey in service to our country.
