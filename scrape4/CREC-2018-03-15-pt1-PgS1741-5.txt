                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN McCAIN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this week marks an important 
anniversary for an exceptional American. Forty-five years ago 
yesterday, our friend and colleague John McCain was released after more 
than 5\1/2\ years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
  The ``Hanoi Hilton'' was the site of unspeakable brutality, but it 
was also a crucible of character, where a brave patriot was tested and 
grew into a generational leader.
  Here in the Senate, we are not only grateful that John McCain was 
welcomed home, we are especially grateful that he answered yet another 
call to serve, bringing that leadership to this body for more than 30 
years. His leadership and his example are as important today as they 
have ever been.
