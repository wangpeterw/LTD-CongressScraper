           By Mr. COLE:
       H.R. 133.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Amendment XVI to the United States Constitution.
       Additionally, since the Constitution does not provide 
     Congress with the power to provide financial support to U.S. 
     political parties, the general repeal of the Presidential 
     Election Campaign Fund for this purpose is consistent with 
     the powers that are reserved to the States and to the people 
     as expressed in Amendments IX and X to the United States 
     Constitution.
       Further, Article I Section 8 defines the scope and powers 
     of Congress and does not include this concept of taxation in 
     furtherance of funding U.S. political parties within the 
     expressed powers.
