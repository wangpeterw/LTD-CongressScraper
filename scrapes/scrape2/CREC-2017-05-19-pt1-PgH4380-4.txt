                 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS

  (Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th 
anniversary of the National Association of Home Builders.
  For three-quarters of a century, the NAHB has been fighting for 
homeowners, home builders, and communities across the country. Today, 
the federation includes over 700 local and State home builder 
associations who are committed to fostering a pro-growth climate and 
sensible, cost-effective housing policies.
  How do I know? Because my family has been involved in our local 
chapter for decades.
  The NAHB has long supported the builders who create beautiful homes 
in west Michigan--my home--as well as across the Nation. Many of these 
builders are small-business men and women who represent the backbone of 
the American economy.
  By standing up to regulatory overreach and promoting a pro-growth 
environment, the NAHB is helping these entrepreneurial small businesses 
to have a voice. Thanks in part to the efforts of the NAHB, builders 
and consumers throughout the country are back on their feet, housing 
production has increased, and builders are increasingly confident in 
the market.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the National 
Association of Home Builders as they work to keep the home building 
industry moving forward.
  Congratulations for those 75 years.
