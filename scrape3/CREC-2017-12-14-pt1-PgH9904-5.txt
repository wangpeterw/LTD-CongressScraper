                          A PARTISAN TAX BILL

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, how do you make a bad, partisan tax bill 
better? For my Republican colleagues, apparently that means cutting tax 
rates for the wealthy even more than the original bill, as we have 
heard over the last couple days.
  Where is the fairness for average, hardworking Americans?
  Medical expenses are no longer deductible.
  Student loans and tuition waivers are no longer deductible.
  Interest is not deductible for families, but it is for business.
  The mortgage interest deduction is reduced.
  State and local taxes are not fully deductible.
  Small businesses don't get the same tax cuts that big businesses do.
  No help for capital gains.
  No help for dividends, advertising, or entertaining.
  Other business expense is no longer deductible.
  Renewable energy tax credits go away.
  Private activity bonds that help veterans and many others are also 
gone.
  Worst of all, individual tax cuts flip back and are rescinded in a 
few years, while corporations go on forever.
  Where is the fairness for seniors, for our youth, for our families, 
and for small businesses? Not in this partisan tax bill.
