                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, the fountain of wisdom, as our lawmakers do the work of 
freedom, give them the assurance of Your provisions and prevailing 
presence. Remind them of Your promise to never leave or forsake Your 
people. Nourish our Senators this day with spiritual truths and moral 
qualities that will make our Nation strong and good.
  Lord, surround our legislators and their loved ones with the shield 
of Your Divine favor, being for them a shade by day and a defense by 
night.
  And, Lord, in this land we love, draw together the diverse men and 
women from every race, creed, and culture, forging us into a united 
force for good. Empower us to accomplish Your purposes on Earth, as we 
remember that words matter and that out of the abundance of the heart, 
the mouth speaks.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
