                     HOW THE FIRST AMENDMENT WORKS

  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TROTT. Madam Speaker, over the weekend, I spent a little time 
watching football. I am happy to say that my Michigan Wolverines won 
their game; sad to say that the Detroit Lions lost to the Falcons, but, 
hopefully, they will have a good season.
  There was also quite a bit of controversy this weekend about who was 
standing and sitting for our National Anthem at sporting events. We do 
not need to concern ourselves with this issue, and the reason is 
because the First Amendment works.
  Here is how the First Amendment works: A little over a year ago, a 
quarterback in the NFL chose not to stand for the National Anthem. I 
personally disagree with that statement, but it was his choice under 
the First Amendment. The fans booed. The fans could have clapped; they 
could have booed. Many fans booed. The owners listened, and now that 
quarterback is not employed in the NFL.
  That is how the First Amendment works. What we should concern 
ourselves with is how soon 3 million people in Puerto Rico are going to 
get water and electricity, why millions of Americans are uncertain 
regarding their healthcare, and what we are going to do about North 
Korea.

  Madam Speaker, that is what we need to focus on in this House. That 
is what we were sent to do.
