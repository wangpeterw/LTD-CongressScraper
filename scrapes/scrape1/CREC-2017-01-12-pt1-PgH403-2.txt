                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, to know how high the stakes are in the 
Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you onlyhave to 
listen to your constituents. One of the many I have heard from is Kevin 
Wittbrodt from Warren, Michigan, who writes:``I'm a Marine Corps 
veteran, and I'm covered by the VA system, but my wife isn't. She has 
kidney disease and I've found it hardto get coverage for her with the 
preexisting condition . . . but I found an affordable plan under the 
ACA. This allows forcontinued treatment and she's still with me.''
  ACA is not collapsing, contrary to what the Speaker is saying. The 
Republicans are trying to sink ACA while it is very muchafloat and 
alive for Kevin, his wife, and millions and millions of others. 
Republicans have been promising a plan for 7 yearsand never delivered. 
They will not deliver now for all of America.
