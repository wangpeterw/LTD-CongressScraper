                        TRIBUTE TO WILL JANKLOW

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Will Janklow, one 
of my Washington, DC, interns, for all of the hard work he has done for 
me and my staff at the Senate Republican Conference.
  Will is a graduate of Northland Pines High School in Eagle River, WI. 
Currently, he is attending the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, 
MN, where he is majoring in mathematics. Will is a dedicated worker who 
has been committed to getting the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Will Janklow for all 
of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the 
years to come.
