           By Mr. BRAT:
       H.R. 5000.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 3: ``To regulate Commerce with 
     foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the 
     Indian Tribes''.
       The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution 
     includes granting Congress the power to regulate interstate 
     commerce and commerce with foreign nations, which would 
     therefore include air commerce such as interstate and foreign 
     air travel.
       Article I, Section 8, Clauses 14 and 15: ``To make Rules 
     for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval 
     Forces'' and ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to 
     execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and 
     repel Invasions''.
       The Military Regulations and Militia Clauses give Congress 
     the power to regulate the military or military components and 
     make rules for war, giving Congress the power to authorize 
     and amend programs like the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 18: ``To make all Laws which 
     shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the 
     foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this 
     Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in 
     any Department or Officer thereof.''
       The Necessary and Proper Clause further recognizes that 
     Congress has the legal authority to exercise powers 
     enumerated under Article I.
