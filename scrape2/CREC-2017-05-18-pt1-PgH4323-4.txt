                         PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise yet again to challenge you 
to put country before political party. For too long, candidate and now 
President Trump has been playing a game of dangerous liaisons with 
Vladimir Putin and his Russian regime.
  He called on Russian spies--that is right, the KGB--to hack his 
opponent. He fired the Acting Attorney General who warned him. He fired 
the FBI Director investigating him. And he has shared highly classified 
intelligence with Russia, posing a direct threat to our brave assets on 
the ground.
  When is enough enough?
  Mr. Speaker, how much longer before you do your job and bring up the 
bipartisan Protecting Our Democracy Act that is cosponsored by 199 
Members of this House?
  Show us that you have the courage to put country before political 
party. Show us that you meant it when you said ``against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic.'' Show us that you will do what is right by our 
country and stand up to this President.

                          ____________________
