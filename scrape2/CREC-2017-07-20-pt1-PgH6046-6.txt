                   LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON HEALTHCARE

  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, many health insurance executives say they are 
raising premiums and leaving exchanges because of uncertainty and the 
threat of not paying the cost-sharing reductions and not funding them.
  Brad Wilson, CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina told The 
Washington Post in May: ``The failure of the administration and the 
House to bring certainty and clarity by funding CSRs has caused our 
company to file a 22.9 percent premium increase, rather than one that 
is materially lower.''
  We need a bipartisan solution to stabilize exchanges. We need to stop 
threatening not to pay the CSRs.
  I introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act, which provides stability 
by permanently funding and expanding eligibility for these subsidies. 
This is pragmatic, commonsense legislation to stop premiums from 
skyrocketing, keep insurers in exchanges, and help people struggling to 
afford healthcare.
  I urge Republicans and Democrats to put people over partisanship and 
solutions above ideology by working together, by sponsoring my bill, 
and helping American families afford healthcare.
