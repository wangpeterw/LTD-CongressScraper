                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, it is a distinct honor to rise today to 
recognize National Police Week, honoring our heroes of the thin blue 
line. During this week each year, our Nation joins together to honor 
our brave men and women in blue.
  In their mission to serve and protect, our law enforcement officers 
put their lives on the line each day, keeping our families and our 
communities safe from harm. Day in and day out, we witness the 
countless sacrifices made by the men and women who serve as our front 
line of defense here at home.
  We stand to recognize their service this week. We also pay tribute to 
those who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty. Their 
bravery and sacrifice will never be forgotten.
  I would like to specifically thank the dedicated officers serving 
throughout the State of New York. From the New York State troopers to 
the county sheriffs and to our local law enforcement, the heroism and 
bravery of the
