MOMENT OF SILENCE TO HONOR VICTIMS OF TRAGIC PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE COLLAPSE 
                  AT FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY

  (Mr. DIAZ-BALART asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I am joined here today by members of 
the Florida delegation to honor the victims of the tragic pedestrian 
bridge collapse at Florida International University.
  Last week, a pedestrian bridge that was designed to protect students 
and other campus personnel and visitors from the traffic on one of our 
busiest thoroughfares collapsed, taking the lives of six innocent 
people and leaving others gravely injured.
  So many of us, particularly in south Florida, have a close and 
meaningful relationship with FIU, or Florida International University, 
and its students. This tragedy has hit our community exceedingly hard. 
We also know that, today, six grieving families are mourning in the 
wake of this horrific event.
  Mr. Speaker, I know I speak on behalf of my colleagues when I say we 
are truly heartbroken after Thursday's horrendous bridge collapse. We 
are thinking of the victims, those injured, and are mourning with their 
families during this very difficult time.
  This Florida delegation, Mr. Speaker, and this Congress, will leave 
no stone unturned to ensure something like this never happens again 
anywhere in our great country.
  Alexa Duran;
  Navaro Brown;
  Brandon Brownfield;
  Rolando Fraga-Hernandez;
  Osvaldo Gonzalez; and,
  Alberto Arias.
  We will never, ever forget them. We will remember them and grieve the 
lives cut short by this tragedy.
  Mr. Speaker, may their legacy live on with all of us, with our 
community, and in the hearts of their loved ones.
  Mr. Speaker, I would respectfully ask that the House observe a moment 
of silence in honor of these victims.
