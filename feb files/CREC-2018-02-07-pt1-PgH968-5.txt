   RECOGNIZING OLYMPIC ATHLETES FROM THE CENTRAL COAST OF CALIFORNIA

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a couple of 
Olympic athletes from my district on the central coast of California.
  Brita Sigourney and Nick Cunningham will be representing Team USA at 
the Olympics in South Korea.
  Brita attended the same schools I went to, Carmel High and UC Davis. 
She is a freestyle skier, and she is the first woman to land a 1080 in 
competition at the halfpipe run, and she is one of the top female 
freestyle skiers in the world.
  Nick is a bobsledder. He also went to one of the schools I went to: 
Monterey Peninsula College. He is a sergeant in the Army National Guard 
and a member of the Army's World Class Athlete Program.
  Starting this Friday, Brita and Nick will compete on the world stage 
under the stars and stripes of our flag.
  As we know, the Olympics is an event where many different people from 
different places come together and compete with one another for the 
thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, and in doing so, they 
provide their opponents with dignity and respect.
  Hopefully we here in Washington will not only watch the Olympics, but 
we will learn from Olympians like Brita and Nick, because it is our 
hometown athletes who not only understand what it takes to win, they 
know what it takes to represent the best team at the Olympics and the 
best country in the world.
