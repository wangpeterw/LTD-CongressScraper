            RECOGNIZING FORMER-REPRESENTATIVE XAVIER BECERRA

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible 
work of former-Congressman and now California State Attorney General 
Xavier Becerra.
  Attorney General Becerra holds nearly three decades of elected public 
service as a State legislator, a Member of Congress, and now as 
California's attorney general.
  I am proud to call Xavier Becerra my friend. It has been a pleasure 
to work alongside him as he courageously fought for all Americans, for 
women, LGBTQ communities, minorities, and comprehensive immigration 
reform.
  He is the first Latino to serve as a member of one of the powerful 
committees in our House, and he is also the first Latino chairman of 
the Democratic Caucus. Through his leadership and guidance, our 
priorities have become more defined and have driven the legislative 
process.
  Attorney General Becerra, thank you for your tireless service and 
commitment to our country as you have certainly become one of the most 
influential leaders of our time.
