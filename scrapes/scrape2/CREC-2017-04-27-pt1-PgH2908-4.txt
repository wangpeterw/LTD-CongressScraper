                      CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Representative Fitzpatrick and 
I introduced a bipartisan resolution calling on the House to commit to 
the removal of political gerrymandering from congressional 
redistricting and to improve the public confidence in our electoral 
process.
  Every citizen in every State deserves to have the same ability as 
citizens in States like California, Arizona, Hawaii, and Ohio, who now 
have to draw their Congressional district boundaries without the 
influence and gamesmanship of politics.
  The political gerrymandering of our congressional districts, which 
attacks at the very bedrock the right of every American to fair 
representation, has seriously undermined the public's trust in our 
democratic system.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time to get the back room out of the ballot box 
and let the people decide.
