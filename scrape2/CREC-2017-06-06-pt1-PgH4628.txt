             50TH ANNIVERSARY OF REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, on the 50th anniversary of the reunification 
of Jerusalem and on behalf of Hoosiers from Indiana's Sixth 
Congressional District, I rise today to send my prayers and best wishes 
to the Jewish state.
  It is our hope that the special relationship between America and 
Israel continues to be strengthened and to grow. Israel is our most 
important friend in that region of the world and among America's 
strongest allies anywhere in the world. On this anniversary, let it be 
reaffirmed that Indiana and America stand with Israel.
  The Holy City is a place of prayer for all people, and this day 
provides us with an opportunity to pray for the Jewish state. May it 
remain a beacon of light, representing democracy and freedom, and may 
peace and prosperity reign for its people.
  The eternal capital of the State of Israel, Jerusalem, is also a seat 
of parliament; and from one representative body to another, we say 
``Shalom'' and ``God bless.'' Our prayers are with Israel today, 
tomorrow, and always.
