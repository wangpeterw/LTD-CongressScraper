                       TAX REFORM LISTENING TOUR

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, last week in Minnesota, I conducted a tax 
reform listening tour, visiting small businesses in our community about 
why tax reform is so important. Throughout the tour, it was evident 
that these small businesses were enthusiastic that tax reform means 
more jobs, higher wages, and a stronger economy.
  Diversified Plastics in Brooklyn Park, an employee-owned company that 
manufactures and assembles plastic injection products, said that being 
able to immediately expense new equipment will allow them to invest 
more in their company and hire more people.
  Northstar Balloons in Plymouth, which manufactures and distributes 
foil party balloons, said that a Tax Code that provides stability and 
predictability will allow them to invest in their company with 
confidence.
  Mr. Speaker, the message was clear: fixing a broken Tax Code will 
help small businesses hire more people, give their employees a raise, 
and create a growing and a more competitive economy.
