                 RECOGNIZING MONTANA'S OLYMPIC ATHLETES

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three Montana 
athletes who will join Team USA and compete in the 2018 Winter 
Olympics. Darian Stevens of Missoula, Maggie Voisin of Whitefish, and 
Brad Wilson of Butte will represent not only Montana, but our great 
Nation.
  This is the second Olympics where Maggie has qualified, and she will 
compete in the women's slopestyle skiing. Darian, who began skiing when 
she was 4 years old, will also compete in the women's slopestyle 
skiing. Brad, who also started skiing when he was just 4 years old and 
who competed in the Sochi Games four years ago, will compete in the 
men's mogul skiing.
  I look forward to cheering on these outstanding Montanans. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in wishing Maggie, Darian, and Brad success in 
the 2018 Winter Olympics.
