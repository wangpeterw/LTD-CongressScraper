              THE IMPACT OF REPEALING TITLE X REGULATIONS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the 
title X resolution of disapproval that will be on the floor later 
today.
  This misguided resolution will limit access to critical healthcare 
services by allowing States to cherry-pick which family planning 
providers they want to participate in the title X program.
  Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans rely on family planning clinics 
for cancer screenings, well-woman exams, birth control, and sexually 
transmitted disease screenings and treatment. Eighty-five percent of 
the people served by these clinics have incomes below 200 percent of 
the Federal poverty level, and 48 percent of them are uninsured. 
Furthermore, at least half of family planning clinics are located in 
rural and underserved communities already with limited access to health 
care.
  If this resolution passes, politicians in any State or community will 
be able to interfere with eligible and competent title X providers who 
care for the most vulnerable and underserved in our country. The only 
factors that should ever dictate eligibility to provide family planning 
health services are professional competency and State licensure.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 43 and protect 
healthcare access for 4 million Americans who rely on the title X 
clinics for their care.
