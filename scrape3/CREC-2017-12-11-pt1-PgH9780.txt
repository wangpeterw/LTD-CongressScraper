                             NET NEUTRALITY

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, in 3 days, the internet as we know it could 
change forever.
  On December 14, the FCC will be taking a vote on whether or not to 
get rid of net neutrality protections that keep the internet open, 
fair, and equal for everyone. Repealing these protections will allow 
internet service providers like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T to control 
the levers of the internet--stifling access, deciding which websites 
you and I can visit and use, and making it virtually impossible for 
small businesses to compete against industry giants.
  It will hurt our students, entrepreneurs, working families, and all 
who rely on the internet for things from education to healthcare to 
employment as a level playing field of opportunity.
  The FCC must protect the people it is supposed to be serving, not big 
corporate interests, and make sure that the internet remains a place 
where everyone has a seat at the table.
