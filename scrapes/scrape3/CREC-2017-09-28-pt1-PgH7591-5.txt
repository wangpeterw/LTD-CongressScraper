                    WELCOMING PASTOR J. TODD MULLINS

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast) 
is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today especially pleased to have had my 
personal pastor, Todd Mullins, give our opening prayer this morning to 
the House of Representatives.
  I am honored to welcome Pastor Mullins onto the floor of the House of 
Representatives as our guest chaplain this morning, and I thank him for 
sharing those very important words with our colleagues and that 
scripture as well.
  Todd Mullins is the senior pastor of Christ Fellowship in Palm Beach 
Gardens, Florida, where he served since his father founded the church 
in 1984.
  I can say a great deal about my friend, Pastor Todd Mullins, but the 
most important thing that I could say about him is that he is a man of 
God, and that he works every single day to try to help and change 
lives.
  I think that is the most important thing any one of us can do. That 
is why I am so proud to call him a friend. He is a person who has 
devoted his life to working on the lives of others.
