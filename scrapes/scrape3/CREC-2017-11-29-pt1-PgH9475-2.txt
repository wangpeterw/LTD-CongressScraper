                      THANKING DR. ROBERT MARTINO

  (Mr. McKINLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Dr. Robert Martino 
of Clarksburg, West Virginia.
  In 2013, Dr. Martino began a unique program, generously providing one 
day of free dental services to local Active-Duty military and their 
families. He wanted to give back to those who have sacrificed so much, 
and he has continued to do so each and every year, thereafter, and has 
spread this idea throughout his professional network.
  This day of service has now swept across the Nation, with over 500 
businesses now offering our soldiers everything from dental services to 
accounting. It has become known as Freedom Day.
  But that isn't enough. I want to challenge more businesses to 
participate. Visit freedomday.usa.org to find out how to get involved.
  Dr. Martino, thank you for the example you set for America. You are 
truly a great American.
