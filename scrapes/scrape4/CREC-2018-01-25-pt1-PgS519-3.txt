                        TRIBUTE TO COLTON MEEHAN

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Colton Meehan, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Colton is a graduate of the University of California, Santa Cruz, 
having earned a degree in politics. He is a dedicated worker who has 
been committed to getting the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Colton Meehan for all 
of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the 
years to come.
