                          UCR VETERANS PROJECT

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, the Riverside National Cemetery is the final 
resting place for nearly 300,000 former military personnel and their 
family members. Each of them have a story that deserves to be told.
  I rise today to applaud the University of California, Riverside, on a 
new grant that will be used to research and tell these stories.
  With support from the Department of Veterans Affairs, UC Riverside 
faculty and students will document the lives of those who served and 
partner with K-12 schools to help teach young people about the value of 
service and sacrifice. Our duty to honor those who sacrificed for this 
Nation is not limited to Memorial Day or Veterans Day.
  This project will help our community understand and appreciate the 
individuals whose service has kept this Nation safe and free. I am 
proud that UC Riverside has been selected for this important initiative 
and look forward to seeing the meaningful work it will produce.
