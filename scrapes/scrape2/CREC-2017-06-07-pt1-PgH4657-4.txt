                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  As we begin the 84th year since the heroic efforts of our troops and 
our allies on D-day, help us to be mindful of the freedoms we enjoy and 
must be vigilant in protecting.
  Bless our allies throughout the world and all those who stand with us 
in confronting the dangers and evils of our time. In all things, may 
the United States continue to be a beacon of light and hope.
  Bless the Members of this people's House. Give them the wisdom and 
patience to do the work of Congress even in times of complexity both at 
home and abroad.
  God bless America, and help us all to be our best selves. May all 
that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
