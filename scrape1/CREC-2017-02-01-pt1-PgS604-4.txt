 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--READING OF WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS

  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that not 
withstanding the resolution of the Senate of January 24, 1901, the 
traditional reading of Washington's Farewell Address take place on 
Monday, February 27, 2017, at a time to be determined by the majority 
leader in consultation with the Democratic leader.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
