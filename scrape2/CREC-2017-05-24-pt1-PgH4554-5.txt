                     JUDICIARY SYSTEM IN NICARAGUA

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today, the Western Hemisphere 
Subcommittee passed a bill that I authored, the Nicaraguan Investment 
and Conditionality Act, the NICA Act.
  I thank Chairman Duncan and Ranking Member Sires for working with me 
to pass this important bipartisan measure that seeks to promote 
freedom, anticorruption, the rule of law, and supports an independent 
judiciary system in Nicaragua.
  This measure sends a strong message of support to the people of 
Nicaragua that they are not alone. We in the United States Congress 
recognize their plight and aspirations for a better future of freedom 
and opportunity. We share their values of a free and fair electoral 
system, of justice and liberty

for all Nicaraguans, and we support their pursuit of a more open and 
democratic society.
