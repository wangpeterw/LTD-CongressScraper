                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gene Hemrick, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Lord God, as we approach the season of spring, please bless our 
Congress and country with fruitful planting resulting in a horn of 
plenty to nourish us and those who don't have it as well as us.
  May our country and Congress continue to share its bountiful food 
with the starving in this world. Please grace them with the strength 
needed to shoulder this awesome responsibility.
  Amen.
