                                 PRAYER

  Reverend William Lynn Nash, Glad Tidings Pentecostal Church, Mangham, 
Louisiana, offered the following prayer:
  Our eternal God, may divine direction be upon the Members of the 
people's House.
  The psalmist pleaded for Thy saving health among the nations. May the

[[Page H7497]]

Representatives from Chicago to San Francisco, from New York to New 
Orleans, O God, be granted the wisdom of Solomon and the strength of 
the great apostle Paul.
  May the anointing of Thy Holy Ghost bless this body, from committee 
rooms where compromise is made, to this very floor, may grace and peace 
become our banner.
  Forgive us, O Lord, of backsliding. Empty out our arrogance. Fill the 
Members of Congress with the very best of heavenly manna. Repair the 
breach, and may the House of Adams, Lincoln, and Rayburn become renewed 
with the best fruits of labor.
  Lead this House to the mountaintop of victory today, so that 100 
years from this very day, it may be said: It was good to have been 
here.
  I pray in the name of Jesus.
  Amen.
