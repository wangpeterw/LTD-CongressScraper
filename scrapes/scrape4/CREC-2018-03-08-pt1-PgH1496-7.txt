                          NO HELP FOR DREAMERS

  (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, March 5, the President's self-imposed 
deadline, has come and gone, and there is still no solution for 
Dreamers.
  We know them as Dreamers. The President knows them as human 
bargaining chips. They make up the fabric of our country. They sit next 
to our children in classes. They are our neighbors, our friends, and 
our families.
  I am here to tell a story about my family, one you may not know.
  My son joined the Army and was stationed in South Korea, where he met 
a lovely young lady. He finally and she finally got together, and they 
were married and stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, together, where my 
granddaughter was born. It was a very proud day.
  Later that same year, I got a call in the middle of the night from my 
son, who was crying, saying that his wife was going to be deported. I 
said: Deported where?
  Apparently, some misfiled paperwork had shown up. My daughter-in-law 
is a Dreamer. She served our country and would give her life up.
  Pass the Dream Act now so the current generation of Dreamers can 
obtain the same thing as my daughter-in-law did.
