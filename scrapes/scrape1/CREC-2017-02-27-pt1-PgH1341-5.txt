                             THE 2020 PLAN

  (Mr. CRIST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an innovative 
effort in my hometown of St. Petersburg, Florida. Known as the 2020 
Plan, its goal is simple: to reduce poverty by 30 percent in south St. 
Petersburg by 2020. The plan connects all aspects of society to promote 
investment, create jobs, and support families, and it is working.
  In 2015 alone, the poverty rate in the community dropped by 8.5 
percent, compared to 1.6 percent nationally. This effort is truly 
inspiring. I salute the leadership of Gypsy Gallardo; the Pinellas 
County Urban League and its president Watson Haynes, my brother; the 
city of St. Petersburg; and over 100 grassroots community organizations 
that are working together to reduce poverty in this historically 
underserved community. Thank you and God bless you.
