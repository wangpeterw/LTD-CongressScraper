                RECOGNIZING WINFIELD SCOTT ``BUD'' JONES

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Winfield Scott 
Jones, affectionately known as Bud, a respected constituent of the 22nd 
Congressional District, who dedicated his life to improving our 
community.
  After graduating from Syracuse University in 1963, Bud Jones worked 
as a physical education teacher at Pulaski High School for 33 years. 
During his tenure, Bud also served as the track and field coach and the 
basketball coach. Bud was named New York State Coach of the Year and 
was inducted into the Central New York High School Basketball Hall of 
Fame.
  Bud Jones was a shining example of the tremendous impact that one 
individual can have on an entire community. He was a gracious leader 
and a positive influence on the young men and women he taught and 
coached, always motivating them to strive for excellence.
  Winfield Scott Jones, affectionately known by all of us as Bud, 
passed away peacefully on November 4, 2017. It is with sadness that we 
mourn his passing, and we extend our condolences to his beloved family.
  We know that his spirit will live on in all those who had the 
privilege of knowing him. Our community is forever grateful for his 
service and profound impact on all of us.
