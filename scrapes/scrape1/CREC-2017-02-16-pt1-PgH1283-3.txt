                         U.S.-ISRAELI RELATIONS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the relationship between the United States 
and Israel is a very important one, a moral one, and one beneficial to 
both sides.
  I was very glad to see this week the President, so early on in his 
term, inviting and making welcome Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 
this country and showing that the U.S. relation with Israel is as 
important to us as it is to them.
  Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state, through much of its 
history of this Earth has been a very strong one for their assertion 
for their rights to be part of the fiber of the Middle East. The United 
States needs to be on their side and a firm partner in what they need 
to do.
  So, again, kudos to President Trump for making this establishment of 
this relationship early on in his term and sending that assurance to 
Prime Minister Netanyahu, the people of Israel, and the importance to 
the people of this country of that relationship.
