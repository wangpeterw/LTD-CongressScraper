                           HELP THE DREAMERS

  (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, last week, when I was home in my district, 
I hosted an event called DREAMers Demand Answers. It was an opportunity 
for DREAMers in my community to come and have a conversation with me in 
the wake of the President's decision to rescind DACA, to let me know 
what questions and concerns they had so that I could come back here and 
pass those concerns along to my colleagues here in Congress.
  Of all the questions, one really stood out to me: Can you help us? I 
was especially struck by this question because the answer is yes. Yes, 
I can help them; and, yes, we in this body can help them.
  By passing the bipartisan Dream Act, we can help these young people. 
We help them stay in their homes. We can help them keep their jobs. We 
can help them keep their families together. This is not a hard question 
to answer.
  These are young people who grew up here that are as American as any 
one of us in this room, and they aren't asking for much. Mr. Speaker, I 
am on the floor today to ask my colleagues on the other side: Please 
help them. Join me in supporting the bipartisan Dream Act.
