          MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY MARKS ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud Bobcat to 
recognize Montana State University, which is celebrating its 125th 
anniversary tomorrow on Founders' Day.
  Montana State University, a land-grant university in my hometown of 
Bozeman, was formed in 1893. Originally, the agricultural college of 
the State of Montana, the school started with eight students in a small 
classroom in a local high school.
  The college quickly grew to include many other degree paths, 
including engineering and nursing; two programs for which the school is 
particularly known.
  Today, Montana State University serves over 16,000 students each 
year. This year's spring enrollment set a new record for the tenth year 
in a row.
  Montana State University is a cornerstone of the Bozeman community, 
and we are fortunate to have such an institution in our State.
  The fact is that the success of my business, as well as that of many 
others, would not have been possible without Montana State University.
  Go, Cats, go.
