                 PASS TAX CUTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, we have an incredible opportunity to pass 
tax cuts for the American people. I appreciate President Trump's 
leadership on this issue as well as the leadership of Chairman Brady in 
working to pass the President's tax plan.
  While we are working on tax cuts, I rise today to urge the chairman 
and the Ways and Means Committee to also eliminate tax credits for 
illegal immigrants. Most Hoosiers get it: we can't continue to reward 
people who come to our country illegally while those who work hard and 
play by the rules struggle to get ahead.
  I have authored legislation to close the loophole that allows $7 
billion in refundable child tax credits to be paid out to illegal 
immigrants every year. This money should be used to increase the child 
tax credit for law-abiding American families. President Trump included 
this proposal in his budget request to Congress, and I believe it 
should be included in the President's broader tax plan.
