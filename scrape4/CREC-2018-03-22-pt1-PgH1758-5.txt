 HONORING THE SEVEN U.S. MILITARY MEMBERS KILLED IN IRAQ ON MARCH 16, 
                                  2018

  (Mr. KINZINGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of our fallen 
heroes, the seven U.S. military members killed in the helicopter crash 
over western Iraq on Saturday, March 16, 2018.
  As an airman, I had the privilege of flying with Captain Andreas 
O'Keefe. His Air Force service included three tours in Iraq, serving in 
Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa and, most recently, in Texas to help 
out during Hurricane Harvey. And still, he wanted to do more.
  Andy was a fellow air guardsman, a Long Island guy, and served with 
the 106th Rescue Wing of the New York Air National Guard. Like many who 
join the service, Andy did so voluntarily, with a servant's heart, 
eager to serve his country and to help others. Without question, he 
lived by the 106th credo: ``That others may live.''
  As a nation, we mourn for the families and loved ones of those fallen 
heroes. We send them our prayers, deepest condolences, and deepest 
gratitude for their service to the country.
  While we grieve this tragic loss, I know Andy died doing what he 
loved and what he was called to do and what he wanted to do: serve his 
country.
  Mr. Speaker, we stand in this Chamber because of the sacrifices of 
men and women like this. We have the freedom to debate and vote and use 
our voices because of their sacrifice.
  With that, it is with a heavy heart that I say Godspeed to my friend, 
Captain O'Keefe.
  May God bless our troops every day.
