                   OBAMACARE FAILED TO MEET ITS GOALS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because ObamaCare, 
though well intentioned, has failed to meet its own goals and promises.
  There is a lot of passion on both sides of the aisle, I know. I just 
sat through 27 hours of debate in the Energy and Commerce Committee 
last week. It is clear that Republicans and Democrats have shared goals 
when it comes to health care. We want lower premiums, more choices, 
high-quality health care, the best in the world. But ObamaCare did not 
get us there. And if we continue on the current path, health care in 
this country is only going to get worse.
  Premiums this last year alone have risen, on average, across this 
country by 25 percent. One out of three counties only has one plan 
available to them. Networks are collapsing.
  That is why we are working to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We are 
committed to creating a better healthcare future for every person in 
America. No back-room deals, no ramming through bills no one has had 
time to read, and no surprises.
  Every step of the way, we want to hear from you, the American people. 
Visit readthebill.gop and give us your feedback. Health care should be 
an open, transparent process through regular order, and that is exactly 
what we are doing with the American Health Care Act.
