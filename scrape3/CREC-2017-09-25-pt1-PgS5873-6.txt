                     NOMINATION OF WILLIAM EMANUEL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for more than 80 years, the NLRB has 
been responsible for the impartial resolution of labor disputes and for 
ensuring stable labor relations.
  Under the Board majority appointed by the Obama administration, 
however, the NLRB moved from fair administrator of the law to partisan 
activist--one that put leftwing ideology, deep-pocketed union bosses, 
and other special interest friends ahead of middle-class workers.
  It pursued an ambush election rule that would weaken workers' rights. 
It implemented a joint employer mandate that would disadvantage small 
businesses. The list goes on, and the Obama administration pulled out 
every stop to get its way on the Board as well--everything from 
illegally appointing its Members to refusing to allow a Republican 
vacancy to be filled for nearly 2 years.
  A new majority on the NLRB can begin to undo this severe damage and 
restore the Board's neutrality.
  Confirming the nominee before us today, William Emanuel, is sure to 
mark a turning point in the NLRB's direction. His experience in labor 
law is deep, his credentials are impressive, and his confirmation will 
finally allow the NLRB to return to its important work with a full 
slate of Senate-confirmed Board Members--for the first time since 2015.
  The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to be a neutral umpire 
in labor disputes. It is time it get back to that important original 
mission. Confirming Mr. Emanuel today will allow it to do just that.
  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
