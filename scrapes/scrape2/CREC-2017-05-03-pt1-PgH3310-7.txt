                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize this week as National 
Small Business Week and to applaud the vast contributions of small-
business owners and entrepreneurs across my district--the 10th 
Congressional District of New Jersey.
  National Small Business Week is the perfect opportunity to recognize 
the

importance of small businesses, entrepreneurs, and the diversity of 
businessowners.
  In New Jersey, small businesses employ nearly 2 million people and 
make up 99.6 percent of all businesses in the State. Over the last 
decade, women-owned businesses have increased by 45 percent and 
generated over $1.6 trillion in revenue. Minority-owned businesses have 
produced over $1.3 trillion and created 7 million jobs.
  Small businesses are truly the backbone of our Nation and economy. As 
Members of Congress, we must do our part to support all efforts to open 
the doors of opportunity for small business growth. Their success is 
our success.
