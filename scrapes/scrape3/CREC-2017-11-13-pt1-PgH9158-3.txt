  CPI is recognized throughout Pennsylvania as a premier provider of

is today.

  Mr. Speaker, there has been no greater champion for CPI than Hank 
Yeagley for the past two decades, earning him the title of Mr. CPI 
among faculty, staff, administrators, as well as past and present 
students alike. I wholeheartedly congratulate Hank Yeagley on a well 
deserved retirement and wish him the best.
