                                 ETHICS

  (Mr. CICILLINE askedand was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker,yesterday, just a few hours after they 
attempted to kill the independent Office of Congressional Ethics and 
strip it for parts,Republicans backed down in the face of public 
outrage. It speaks volumes that the first thing Republicans attempted 
to do wasweaken ethical standards and that they only changed course 
once their efforts were exposed to the public. This is not what 
theAmerican people sent us here to do.
  It seems that, contrary to rhetoric, Republicans don't want to drain 
the swamp. Theywant to fill it up. This is wrong, and it is critical 
that Members of Congress be accountable and adhere to the highest 
ethicalstandards.
  In the weeks ahead, it is critical that all of us hold the majority 
accountable and prevent them from going backto the days when thinly 
veiled bribes, kickbacks, and worse were commonplace in this town.
  We need more ethical reforms inCongress, not less. That is why I have 
introduced the ETHICS Act, to require every Member of Congress to 
undergo the same annualethics training that their staffs have to 
complete. That is why I am asking Members of both parties to demand 
better from ourelected officials than what we saw over the last 48 
hours.
