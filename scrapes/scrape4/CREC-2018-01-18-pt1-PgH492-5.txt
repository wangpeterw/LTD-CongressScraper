                          RECOGNIZING ED GORIN

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend 
Magistrate Ed Gorin, in the First District of Kentucky, for his decades 
of service to the residents of Taylor County.
  Ed has served his fellow citizens in many capacities throughout the 
years, from his membership on the local school board to spearheading 
local committee projects. He has always been guided by his personal 
motto of ``working for the community.''
  Through the years, he has maintained a singular focus and worked 
tirelessly to better the lives of his fellow Taylor Countians by 
consistently searching for the most fiscally responsible solution for 
the greatest number of citizens--even spending money out of his own 
pocket for community events.
  During his career, he has secured numerous benefits for Taylor 
County, including a volunteer fire department and a recycling program 
which will impact the lives of those in his community for years to 
come.
  Ed Gorin has established an outstanding legacy as a revered public 
servant, and I join with his family and friends, as well as all those 
he has impacted during his career, to express our dedication and 
gratitude for his contributions to Taylor County.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent him and wish him well in his 
recovery efforts.
