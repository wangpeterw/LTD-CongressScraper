                 SOUTH CAROLINA IS RIGHT FOR BUSINESSES

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week The Boyd Company 
released their annual report confirming that South Carolina is the best 
State to locate or expand a business for jobs.
  As reported in The Spartanburg Herald-Journal on Monday, the Palmetto 
State ranks the lowest in the Nation in annual operating costs for 
advanced manufacturing companies. This success is also improved by low 
property taxes and being a right-to-work State, which has helped 
recruit high-quality jobs for South Carolina families by remarkable 
companies, including BMW, Michelin, Boeing, Volvo, MTU, and more.
  South Carolina is also a competitive State to create jobs because of 
our educated workforce. Working with readySC and Apprenticeship 
Carolina, businesses have technical colleges to close the skills gap 
and hire employees for highly technical jobs, enhanced with positive 
Federal legislation.
  I appreciate the leadership of local chambers of commerce in creating 
jobs, working with Governor Henry McMaster and Secretary of Commerce 
Bobby Hitt.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
