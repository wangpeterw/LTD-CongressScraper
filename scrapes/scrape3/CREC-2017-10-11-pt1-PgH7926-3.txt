                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Molly Fraser, Gig Harbor United Methodist Church, Gig 
Harbor, Washington, offered the following prayer:
  God of many names, we give thanks for the opportunity to serve. 
Remind us that we are servants of our country, our people, and the 
land. Let us not forget all the blessings You have given us so that we 
might use our power and influence to help order the country in ways 
that allow each and every person to find life and liberty and to pursue 
happiness.
  We come, perhaps, already weary from an onslaught of emails, texts, 
tweets, phone calls, and meetings where people make demands on how we 
vote and assumptions about every decision that we put forward. Help us, 
O God, to do the right thing, not just for a few, but for the many. 
Help us work together diligently so we might see the fruit of our 
effort grow into good throughout our country, which can serve to make 
this world more livable for all.
  Amen.
