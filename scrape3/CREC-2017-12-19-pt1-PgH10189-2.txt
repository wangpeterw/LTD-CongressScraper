                 WORK WITH US TO DELIVER A BETTER DEAL

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, since Donald Trump became the leader of the 
Republican Party, they said they would start standing up for America's 
workers. There were promises to stop outsourcing and bring millions of 
manufacturing jobs back home.
  But the two big items on Paul Ryan's agenda have been cutting 
healthcare and is a tax scam that is a direct attack on America's 
middle class. It raises taxes on 86 million middle class households. It 
hands 83 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent. Perhaps 
worst of all, it is a job killer that will help big corporations move 
jobs overseas.
  They claim it does just the opposite, but why are they trying to ram 
this thing through so fast?
  Because they know that in the fine print are new loopholes that make 
it easier for companies to shift our work out of America and pay less 
taxes.
  Sure, this bill will create jobs. It will create them over in China 
and Mexico and Malaysia.
  Mr. Speaker, this tax scam is a huge broken promise. We can do 
better.
