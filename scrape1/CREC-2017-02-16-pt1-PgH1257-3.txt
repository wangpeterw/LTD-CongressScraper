                             GENERAL FLYNN

  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, this week, after news came 
out that General Flynn lied to the people and even to the Vice 
President, Donald Trump was forced to fire yet another adviser because 
of their inappropriate ties to Russia.
  That brings the total since he first launched his campaign to at 
least three. This includes former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who 
resigned after secret records showed he worked with, and profited from, 
the corrupt pro-Russian Government in Ukraine before it was ousted.
  As we suspected, it turns out that Trump's campaign was in near 
constant contact with Russia.
  Now we ask the questions: Why? Did Trump know? How will these secret 
talks influence our foreign policy?
  We deserve answers. Republicans have said that they don't want to 
politicize this, and I agree. That is why I support an independent 
investigation conducted by experts who will provide a more public 
report.
  We have a responsibility to the people to unearth the truth.
