                          BENEFITS OF TAX BILL

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act.
  With Chairman Brady's leadership, my colleagues and I worked hard to 
combine our ideas to help Americans across the Nation have lower taxes, 
better careers, and more money in their family budget.
  Over the past year, it has been a collaborative effort. I have 
listened to and worked with people and businesses about their ideas on 
tax reform from all across the Second Congressional District of 
Arkansas. With today's vote, we are one step closer to reforming our 
broken Tax Code.
  Over the past several months, we have worked to reduce taxes on 
families and let them keep more of their money. For businesses, we want 
to have a more competitive tax system that promotes investment, which 
will spur our economic growth and family prosperity.
  According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, H.R. 1 will raise after-
tax incomes for hardworking Arkansans by over $2,000. Furthermore, H.R. 
1 benefits families by increasing the child tax credit to $1,600, 
instead of $1,000. That helps over 50,000 taxpayers in my district.
  By passing this bill, it could lead to the creation of an additional 
5,000 jobs.
