                           THE TRUMP SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, this is day three of the Trump shutdown. 
How many more extensions are Republicans going to ask for before 
passing a long-term budget? Yes, as we speak right now, the Senate is 
getting ready to pass yet another temporary continuing resolution until 
February 8. At the end of this month, we will hear from the President 
at the State of the Union without having addressed the critical needs 
of the American people.
  The White House and the Republicans in Congress are failing the 
American people by kicking the can down the road and not passing a 
budget that will reauthorize CHIP while also funding community health 
clinics and teaching hospitals, not ensuring protections for 800,000 
DREAMers, and not providing disaster relief.
  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me take a strong opposition to the racist 
comments made previous to me by a Member who is one of my colleagues 
from California. He tried to equate immigration with violent criminals.
  Shame on him. Shame on him. DREAMers are not violent criminals. They 
are members of our Armed Forces, they are teachers, they are workers, 
and they are aspirations to our Nation.
  Shame on him for equating DREAMers with violent criminals.
