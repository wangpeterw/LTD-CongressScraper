                               TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, this is day 49 of the Trump 
administration, which has been characterized by chaos, crisis, and 
confusion. Donald Trump promised to bring the jobs back, but the jobs 
bill must be in the witness protection program because, for the life of 
me, I can't find it.
  Instead, we get TrumpCare, a bill that would destroy health care in 
America as we know it. TrumpCare will increase premiums on the American 
people. TrumpCare will increase copays on the American people. 
TrumpCare will increase deductibles on the American people. TrumpCare 
will increase the cost of prescription drugs on the American people. 
TrumpCare will reduce coverage for the American people. TrumpCare will 
be a disaster. And that is why House Democrats are going to do 
everything in our power to stop this reckless version of health care 
for America.
