                          HUNGER ACTION MONTH

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, September is Hunger Action Month, a 
month where people all over America stand together with the nationwide 
network of food banks to fight hunger. Hunger can affect people from 
all walks of life.
  Too many Americans are one job loss or one medical crisis away from 
food insecurity, and some people, like children and seniors, stand at a 
greater risk of facing hunger. That is why I am proud of the Bucks 
County Fresh Connect program, a free farmers market bringing fresh and 
healthy food to our hungry neighbors. The Fresh Connect program 
provides reliable and needed food to the 57,000 residents of Bucks 
County facing hunger, about a third of whom are children.
  This month I participated in the Fresh Connect program at Solly Farm 
in Ivyland, where fresh produce was collected and delivered to the 
Bucks County Community College in Bristol for distribution.
  I want to thank Philabundance, the Bucks County Opportunity Council, 
the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger, St. Mary Medical 
Center, United Way of Bucks County, Rolling Harvest Food Rescue, and 
Solly Farm for all of their hard work in making this program possible. 
Mr. Speaker, these organizations and all of their generous volunteers 
are a tribute to our community and to our Nation.
