                          REPUBLICAN TAX BILL

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Republicans continue to rush their tax scam 
through Congress, raising taxes on tens of millions of people, 
borrowing over $1 trillion, just to give massive tax breaks to the 
people at the very top of the economy.
  For the last 3 months since we passed the temporary spending bill, 
what has been their focus?
  Has it been to deal with the lack of reauthorization and full funding 
for children's health? No.
  Have they focused at all on the need to deal with the Dream Act and 
those DREAMers who are here, knowing no other place than the United 
States? Have they done anything on that? No.
  They have an obsession about one thing: tax cuts for the wealthiest.
  Have they done anything at all to deal with this opioid crisis? The 
President talked about it, declared an emergency.
  What have we seen from the other side? Nothing, except an obsession 
to give tax breaks to the people at the top. For 3 months since we 
passed that temporary spending bill, that has been the singular 
obsession of the Republican majority.
  That is not what the American people are looking for. That is not 
what they sent us here to do. We should do the work of the American 
people.
