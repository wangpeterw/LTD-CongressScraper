                   CONGRESS NEEDS TO GET BACK TO WORK

  (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, this is about Members of Congress 
doing their job.
  The number one function of a Congress is to put out a budget. This 
Congress spent the last 6 to 8 months giving away $2 trillion to the 
wealthiest people in the country, and now we come to do a budget and 
say: Well, we don't have any money.
  We have priorities here, and it is about taking care of people who 
are getting hurt.
  It is about a gentleman who drove a truck for 40 years, missing 
baseball games and soccer matches because he was on the road. Now that 
he needs his pension, it is cut in half, and this Congress isn't doing 
a damn thing about it.
  It is about the coal miner who climbed into a dirty hole for 40 years 
and now wants a pension. The Republican leadership here is absent.
  It is about healthcare for kids, and it is about 11 million kids who 
are going to law school, going to college, going to med school, and all 
they want is a chance to sleep good at night.
  This Congress needs to get back to work.
