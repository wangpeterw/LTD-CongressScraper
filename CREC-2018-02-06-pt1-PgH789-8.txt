                     TREASON IS NO LAUGHING MATTER

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make it clear that treason 
is not a laughing matter. It is a serious crime embedded in the 
Constitution, punishable by death. But since your Commander in Chief 
chose to raise it at a political rally, let's have a discussion about 
treason.
  Is it treason for a Presidential campaign to meet with a hostile 
foreign power to sell out our democracy and rig the election?
  Is it treason for a Presidential campaign to meet with Russian spies 
who promised information that was negative about a political opponent 
and then failed to report that meeting to law enforcement officials?
  Is it treason for your former National Security Adviser to be a 
Russian asset sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue doing the bidding of 
Vladimir Putin?
  How dare you lecture us about treason. This is not a dictatorship. It 
is a democracy, and we do not have to stand for a reality show host 
masquerading as President of the United States of America.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
