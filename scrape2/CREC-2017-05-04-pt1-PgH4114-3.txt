               OPPOSITION TO THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the 
so-called American Health Care Act. It was a bad deal for America 
before, and it is a worse deal today. It is an offense to working 
families. You are going to pay more for your premiums, co-pays, and 
deductibles, and you are going to get less.
  Preventative services, gone. Mental and behavioral health services, 
no more. Prescription drugs, gone or, at best, a whole lot more 
expensive.
  It is a life-and-death proposition for the 326,000 people in my 
district with preexisting conditions, segregated into expensive high-
risk pools, facing mind-boggling premium increases if you happen to 
have asthma, diabetes, cancer, or become pregnant.
  It is a broken promise to America. President Trump promised not to 
cut Medicaid; broken. He promised insurance for everybody; broken. He 
promised preexisting conditions would be covered; broken.
  Mr. Speaker, I won't be complicit in this broken promise. I won't 
uninsure 24 million Americans. I am resisting. I am voting ``no.''
