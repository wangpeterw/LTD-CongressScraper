           REMEMBERING 49 AMERICANS GUNNED DOWN AT THE PULSE

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, on June 12, 2016, 49 Americans were 
gunned down at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando. Tonight we remember the 
beautiful lives lost and all those who suffered injury in this horrific 
attack.
  Sadly, LGBT Americans continue to be the target of horrific hatred 
and violence here and around the world. Don't let anyone tell you that 
we have full equality in this country. We don't. There is too much 
hatred in this country.
  Anytime an LGBT American is mocked or treated as less than equal, it 
is an attack on the values that all of us share as Americans. These 
expressions of bigotry and intolerance only serve to exacerbate hatred 
and violence. We cannot let them go unanswered.
  Over the last few days, so many have joined in showing their support 
for the LGBT community and remembering the victims in Orlando. We are 
strongest when we stand united toward a common purpose of equality for 
all Americans.
  It is my sincere hope that we will build greater understanding toward 
one another and move closer toward ensuring that every American can 
live free from discrimination and violence of any kind and in a world 
where everyone is valued and treated with dignity and respect.
