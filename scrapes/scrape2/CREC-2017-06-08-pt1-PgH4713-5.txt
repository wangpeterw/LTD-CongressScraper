                              FREE SPEECH

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, people who are the loudest in 
proclaiming their tolerance are often the most intolerant people of 
all.
  This has been proven in spades this year at the most liberal leftwing 
college campuses all over this country. Almost all colleges and 
universities now have programs or offices supposedly promoting 
diversity. However, this diversity apparently does not apply to 
conservatives.
  Probably the least diverse groups in this Nation today are the 
faculties of our universities. And while almost everyone in higher 
education will say they are for freedom of speech, conservative 
students know they can express their views only at the risk of lower 
grades.
  In addition, almost no leading conservatives are invited to be 
college commencements speakers. This year, we have even seen very 
hateful demonstrations and some violence at universities when 
conservative speakers have been invited to speak at these supposed 
bastions of free speech. Some of the young student haters conducting 
their far-left demonstrations would have fit right in during the book-
burning, anti-free speech days in Nazi Germany.
