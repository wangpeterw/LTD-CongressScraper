             HONORING THE LATE CONGRESSMAN ENI FALEOMAVEGA

  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, as chair of the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, or CAPAC, I rise today to 
honor our former colleague, the Honorable Eni Faleomavega of American 
Samoa, who passed away last month.
  Eni was a true patriot, leader, and friend who dedicated his life to 
serving our country. His unwavering commitment to improving the lives 
of all Americans was integrally woven into the fabric of his 
distinguished military and public service career.
  As a founding member of CAPAC, he was also a strong champion for the 
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community across 
the country.
  Throughout his nearly three decades in Congress, he led notable 
efforts to secure critical funding for American Samoa and worked 
tirelessly to cultivate stronger U.S. relations throughout the Asia-
Pacific region.
  It was a privilege to work with Eni, and I will never forget his 
warmth and strong dedication to bettering our community and our 
country.
  I thank Eni for his lifetime of leadership and service and send my 
thoughts to his family during this difficult time.
