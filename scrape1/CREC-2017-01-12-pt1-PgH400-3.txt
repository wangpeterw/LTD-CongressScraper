                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Lord, God of history and ever present, You sent Your prophet Isaiah 
to Your people when they were in need of hope andvision.
  May Isaiah's prophetic words guide the Members of this people's 
House. Send Your Spirit upon them and our Nation, that wemay be open to 
hearing Your word and actively seeking the salvation You alone can 
bring.
  Make of us a people of compassion and holiness. In pursuing the 
avenues of justice for all, may we be a sign to thecommunity of 
nations. Help each Member to work toward the complete fulfillment of 
the deepest human hopes and Your inspiringpromises.
  With humility, let them embrace their calling; to be truly prophetic, 
as Your servants of old, but earnestly fulfilling Yourcommands. May all 
that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
