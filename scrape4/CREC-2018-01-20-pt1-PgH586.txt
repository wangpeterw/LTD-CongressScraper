                     IT IS TIME WE GET BACK TO WORK

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we are about 9 hours into the Schumer 
shutdown, which is basically Senate Democrats holding the United 
States--320 million people--hostage over an executive order made by 
President Obama to benefit 690,000 people here illegally, the DACA 
program.
  The DACA program has nothing to do with funding the government for 
the next 4 weeks. There is plenty of time to continue to address the 
conversation on DACA, which is underway on a bipartisan basis, for 
something that is due in 2 months.
  President Trump rightly decided to rescind what was done by a 
previous executive order so we can abide by the law and put a good law 
in place that addresses border security; chain migration; and what to 
do with those here illegally, which there is a lot of sympathy for 
across this country for those minors who are here under DACA.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time we get back to work and put this country to 
work again and not hold 320 million Americans ransom in order to do 
this for a handful of illegal immigrants in this country.
  We need to get back to work and reopen the government so we are not 
shutting down the CHIP program we passed, the National Guard, et 
cetera.
