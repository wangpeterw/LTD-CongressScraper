              AMERICAN DOLLARS FOR AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I just introduced 
legislation that would require all federally funded transportation and 
infrastructure projects to use materials made right here in America.
  The Buy America 2.0 Act would bolster American manufacturing and 
create quality, family-sustaining jobs right here in our country. 
Democrats have been long fighting for these policies, but this effort 
should be bipartisan.
  American infrastructure projects should start supporting American 
workers. This is a wonderful opportunity to create millions of jobs 
right here at home while investing in critical infrastructure needs 
that have been long neglected.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members of this House, both Democrats 
and Republicans, to cosponsor my Buy America 2.0 Act. Let's put the 
American people back to work.
