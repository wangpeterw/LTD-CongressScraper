                  RECOGNIZING CHANCELLOR KEITH CARVER

  (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Chancellor Keith Carver and celebrate his appointment as chancellor of 
the University of Tennessee at Martin.
  I have known Keith Carver for more than 30 years, and I could not 
think of anyone more deserving of this prestigious role. We met during 
college at the University of Memphis. And during that time, I was 
always impressed by his energy, his creativity, and his focus. Most 
importantly, he was and certainly still is an incredibly strong leader; 
and that is the most important part.
  I believe that Dr. Carver is the right person at the right time--a 
time when this university needs strong, responsible leadership.
  I am so excited for the town of Martin, for the University of 
Tennessee system, and the entire Volunteer State in this prosperous new 
era under Dr. Carver's strong leadership. I can't wait to see what 
great things we can accomplish together.
