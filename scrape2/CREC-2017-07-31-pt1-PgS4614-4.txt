                        TRIBUTE TO SAMUEL FRENCH

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Samuel for his hard work as 
an intern in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. I 
recognize his efforts and contributions to my office, as well as to the 
State of Wyoming.
  Samuel is a native of Wilson, WY, and a graduate of Boston College. 
He studied environmental studies. He has demonstrated a strong work 
ethic, which has made him an invaluable asset to our office. The 
quality of his work is reflected in his great efforts over the last 
several months.
  I want to thank Samuel for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
