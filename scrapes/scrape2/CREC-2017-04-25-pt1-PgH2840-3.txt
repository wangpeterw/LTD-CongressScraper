                            COAL REGULATIONS

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk lately about 
President Trump's first 100 days in office.
  The first 100 days of an administration offer a chance to watch a new 
President turn proposed policy changes into reality. In southwestern 
Pennsylvania, we are seeing President Trump fulfill his pledge to end 
the war on coal, and we are seeing real change.
  For example, the very day that President Trump signed legislation 
overturning one of former President Obama's anti-coal rules, a coal 
company in Somerset County announced it would open a brand-new coal 
mine that will create at least 70 new middle class jobs. It would be 
great if President Trump can make it out to the mine's grand opening 
ceremony scheduled for June 8.
  I have met with miners as their mines were closed during the previous 
administration, and I listened to their stories as they worried about 
their kids and paying their mortgages.
  It is a new day, Mr. Speaker, and I look forward to more employment 
opportunities being created as we begin to roll back the job-killing 
regulations in Washington, D.C.
