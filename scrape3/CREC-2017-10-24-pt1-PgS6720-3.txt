                        PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, good morning.
  Before I get into everything, I have just seen that President Trump 
has resumed his Twitter war with another Member of this body, our 
friend from Tennessee. It is long past time for the President to quit 
his daily compulsion of engaging in Twitter feuds and, instead, get to 
work for the American people. We have a lot of serious issues to deal 
with in this country. Our challenges are too entrenched and complex to 
be solved if the President spends his time in a meaningless war of 
words on Twitter--today with this person, tomorrow with another.
  We need President Trump to roll up his sleeves and get to work--to 
stop tweeting and start leading. Let me repeat that. Maybe the 
President will hear it. For the good of America, we need our President 
to roll up his sleeves and get to work--to stop tweeting and start 
leading.
