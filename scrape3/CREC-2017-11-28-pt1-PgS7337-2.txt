                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, You are the source of life and peace. Praised be Your Name 
forever. We know that it is You who can turn our thoughts toward peace 
and unity. Use Your power to transform our minds and hearts.
  Lord, as our Senators face the challenges of today and tomorrow, give 
them a faith that will find opportunities in every adversity. May they 
cast their burdens on You, trusting Your loving kindness and tender 
mercies. Give them an understanding that puts an end to strife, mercy 
that quenches animosity, and forgiveness that overcomes resentment. May 
each day be for them a building block for making America a nation that 
glorifies You.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
