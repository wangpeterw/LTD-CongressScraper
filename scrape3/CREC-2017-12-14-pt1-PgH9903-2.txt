                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  During these cold, early-darkening days, we ask Your special blessing 
upon those who labor in the Nation's Capitol.
  Help the Members of the House and those of the Senate to act wisely 
and carefully in the important work they do. In the waning days of the 
session, may they continue to heed the voices of all their 
constituents, both those who voted for them and those who did not.
  May all that is done within the people's House be for Your greater 
honor and glory.
  Amen.
