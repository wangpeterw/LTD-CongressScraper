                             SIESTA SENATE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Harvey hammered the great 
State of Texas in August. It devastated over 300,000 homes in the 
Houston area, not including businesses.
  Last year, the House passed a crucial $81 billion disaster relief 
bill. This funding will not only help repair the devastation caused by 
the hurricane, but it will also go toward disaster prevention in the 
future. But Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico are still waiting to see 
this hurricane relief money.
  Why?
  Because the ``Siesta Senate'' still hasn't taken any action. And the 
reason they haven't is because the Senate still uses an archaic, 
outdated 60-vote rule to pass simple legislation.
  The people of Texas are still suffering in their wait. The Senate 
needs to change the 60-vote rule and go back to 51. The Gulf Coast is 
in Hurricane Alley. Maybe the Senate doesn't realize hurricanes come 
around every year.
  Mr. Speaker, there are also over 401 House bills awaiting Senate 
action, and this bill is one of them. The Siesta Senate must vote. Nap 
time is over.
  And that is just the way it is.
