                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, thank You for giving us another day. We thank You on this 
day for the example of St. Nicholas, who fed the hungry, brought hope 
to the imprisoned, gave comfort to the lost, and taught the truth to 
all.
  May all who work here in the people's House strive to imitate him by 
putting You first in all we do.
  Give us the courage, love, and strength of St. Nicholas so that, like 
him, we may serve You through our service to all our brothers and 
sisters.
  May all that we do be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
