                        TRIBUTE TO KATIE MURRAY

  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize Katie Murray for all of 
her hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the citizens of South 
Dakota while working in my Rapid City and Sioux Falls, offices.
  Katie is a joy to work with, and she has been an excellent public 
servant. We wish her the best in all of her future endeavors.
  The citizens of South Dakota, my staff, and I are grateful to Katie 
for her service. We are a better State because of her hard work.
