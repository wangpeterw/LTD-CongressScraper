                          HONORING JERRY RUELF

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Mr. Jerry Ruelf, an 
American hero from Ocala, Florida, who passed away this year on January 
7.
  At the age of 17, Mr. Ruelf joined the 101st Airborne Division during 
World War II and received many decorations for his courageous actions 
overseas, among which are the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple 
Heart. I had the distinct honor several years ago to present him with a 
collection of medals, which required him to get a larger jacket.
  Following the end of the war, Mr. Ruelf continued to serve the 
American people as a teacher at Dixie Hollins High School in St. 
Petersburg, Florida, where he led the school's swim team through an 
undefeated season in 1971. Mr. Ruelf is honored in the Swimming Hall of 
Fame for his accomplishments at both Boca Ciega High School and Dixie 
Hollins High School in Florida.
  Mr. Ruelf was an outstanding patriot, and he will be dearly missed by 
all in his community. His example of leadership through service is one 
we can all learn from.
  To Mr. Ruelf, along with the others from that Greatest Generation 
era, I thank you, my family thanks you, and our Nation thanks you for 
the life you lived, for your service to your country, community, and 
for making this world a better place.
