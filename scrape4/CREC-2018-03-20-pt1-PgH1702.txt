                    OUR JOB IS TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Messer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, as a parent with kids in school, I believe 
that no parent should have to worry if their child will come home safe 
at the end of the day. That is why I rise today to join President Trump 
in urging the Senate to immediately pass the STOP School Violence Act. 
The House overwhelmingly passed this legislation last week, and now it 
is time for the U.S. Senate to act and pass this bipartisan, 
commonsense bill.
  Among other positive steps forward, this bipartisan bill would 
provide funding to enable local schools to make physical and 
technological improvements to keep students safe.
  Southwestern High School in my district has been called the safest 
school in America because of its focus on security, training, and 
coordination with local law enforcement. I have had the opportunity to 
visit Shelby County's Southwestern High School and speak with the 
leadership there and the Shelby County Sheriff's Department leadership 
as well, and, frankly, I could not have been more impressed.
  If the STOP School Violence Act is enacted, more schools could follow 
the example set by Southwestern High School. The U.S. Senate needs to 
do its job now and act quickly to pass this commonsense legislation to 
secure our schools and keep America's children safe.
