                          OPPOSE THE TAX BILL

  (Mr. NOLAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, the simple truth is that the rich are getting 
richer in degrees unparalleled in human history in this country, the 
poor are getting poorer, and the middle class are getting crushed.
  And now our Republican colleagues have offered a proposal to the 
Congress of the United States to make it worse. The fact is that, under 
the Republican tax bill, the upper 1 percent will be getting a $1.7 
trillion tax deduction. At the same time, independent reports tell us 
the middle class will be getting--millions of them--will be getting an 
increase in their taxes, and we will be passing on $1.5 trillion in 
debt to our children and our children's children.
  Mr. Speaker, this tax bill is a scam. It is traditional old-fashioned 
trickle-down economics that has never worked and has been the ruination 
of every great economy in every great country in the world. We have to 
oppose it and stop them from succeeding in this tax scam.
