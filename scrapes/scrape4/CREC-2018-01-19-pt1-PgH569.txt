           RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE

  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise to a question of the 
privileges of the House and offer the resolution previously noticed.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.
  The Clerk read as follows:

                              H. Res. 705

 Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, of high 
                             misdemeanors.

       Resolved, That Donald John Trump, President of the United 
     States, is unfit to be President, unfit to represent the 
     American values of decency and morality, respectability and 
     civility, honesty and propriety, reputability and integrity, 
     is unfit to defend the ideals that have made America great, 
     unfit to defend liberty and justice for all as extolled in 
     the Pledge of Allegiance, is unfit to defend the American 
     ideal of all persons being created equal as exalted in the 
     Declaration of Independence, is unfit to ensure domestic 
     tranquility, promote the general welfare and secure the 
     blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity as lauded 
     in the preamble to the United States Constitution, is unfit 
     to protect government of the people, by the people, for the 
     people as elucidated in the Gettysburg Address, and is 
     impeached for high misdemeanors, and that the following 
     article of impeachment be exhibited to the Senate:
        Article of Impeachment exhibited by the House of 
     Representatives of the United States, in the name of itself 
     and of the people of the United States, against Donald John 
     Trump, President of the United States, in maintenance and 
     support of its impeachment against him for high misdemeanors 
     committed as President constituting harm to American society 
     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States:


                               article i

       In his capacity as President of the United States, 
     unmindful of the high duties of his high office, of the 
     dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony, and 
     respect necessary for stability within the society of the 
     United States, Donald John Trump has with his bigoted 
     statements done more than simply insult individuals and 
     groups of Americans, he has harmed the American society by 
     attempting to convert his bigoted statements into United 
     States policy and by associating the presidency and the 
     people of the United States with bigotry on one or more of 
     the following occasions:
       On January 27, 2017, Donald John Trump issued Executive 
     Order 13769 providing for a partial shutdown of immigration 
     from mainly Muslim countries to fulfill a bigoted campaign 
     promise that read as follows: ``DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON 
     PREVENTING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION (New York, NY) December 7th, 
     2015--Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete 
     shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our 
     country's representatives can figure out what's going on,'' 
     thereby attempting to convert a bigoted campaign promise into 
     United States policy, associating the presidency and the 
     people of the United States with bigotry, thereby casting 
     contempt upon Muslims, inciting hate and hostility, and 
     sowing discord among the people of the United States on the 
     basis of religion.
       On July 26, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement 
     substantially as follows: After consulting with my Generals 
     and military experts, please be advised that the United 
     States Government will not accept or allow Transgender 
     individuals to serve in

[[Page H570]]

     any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be 
     focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be 
     burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption 
     that transgender in the military would entail, thereby 
     attempting to convert his bigoted statement into United 
     States policy, associating the presidency and the people of 
     the United States with bigotry, thereby casting contempt on 
     transgender individuals, inciting hate and hostility, and 
     sowing discord among the people of the United States on the 
     basis of gender.
       On August 15, 2017, Donald John Trump made a widely-
     published statement characterizing a group of anti-Semites, 
     bigots, racists, white nationalists, and Ku Klux Klansmen who 
     rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia, as ``very fine 
     people,'' thereby associating the presidency and the people 
     of the United States with bigotry.
       On October 7, 2017, hate groups returned to 
     Charlottesville, Virginia, at the statue of Robert E. Lee, 
     the Confederate general, chanting ``You will not replace 
     us!'' after having chanted in their August Charlottesville 
     rally that ``Jews will not replace us!''. Since this event on 
     October 7, the President has made widely-published statements 
     about many issues, including the National Football League, 
     but has not made one widely-published statement condemning 
     the hate groups for returning to the place where an innocent 
     person lost her life at the hands of hate.
       On January 11, 2018, Donald John Trump held a meeting with 
     a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders that focused 
     primarily on legislation that would provide a statutory 
     protected status for individuals brought to the United States 
     without documentation. At this meeting, as has been widely-
     published, Donald John Trump made references to people from 
     s-h-i-t-h-o-l-e (or s-h-i-t-h-o-u-s-e) countries. He also 
     questioned why we need more Haitians or people from African 
     countries, proclaiming that we should take them out. Donald 
     John Trump then suggested that Norwegians were better suited 
     to be immigrants to this country, thereby casting contempt on 
     citizens and noncitizens who were welcomed here by previous 
     Presidents due to natural disaster and civil unrest, thereby 
     attempting to convert his bigoted statements into United 
     States policy, associating the presidency and the people of 
     the United States with bigotry, inciting hate and hostility, 
     and sowing discord among the people of the United States on 
     the basis of national origin.
       In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump has, 
     by his statements, brought the high office of President of 
     the United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace and 
     disrepute, has sown discord among the people of the United 
     States, has demonstrated that he is unfit to be President, 
     and has betrayed his trust as President of the United States 
     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States, 
     and has committed a high misdemeanor in office.
       Therefore, Donald John Trump by causing such harm to the 
     society of the United States is unfit to be President and 
     warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office.

                              {time}  1045
