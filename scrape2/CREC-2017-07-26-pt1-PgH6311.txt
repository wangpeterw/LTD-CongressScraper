                          BORDER WALL FUNDING

  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, the inclusion of $1.6 
billion to fund an ineffective divisive border wall is a direct attack 
on immigrant communities across our Nation. Funding this immoral wall 
does nothing to help our country. It only helps to promote President 
Trump's campaign of fear.
  The wall itself mirrors President Trump's approach to policy: 
divisive, ineffective, and motivated by hate.
  This is exemplified by the Trump administration's reckless disregard 
of the humanitarian cost of building a border wall, which will force 
immigrants and asylum seekers to take greater risks and more dangerous 
routes that will likely result in more deaths. Furthermore, this wall 
will literally divide immigrant households and tear families apart.
  Instead of funding ineffective efforts to protect our homeland from 
dangerous threats, this administration would rather fulfill a campaign 
promise that does the exact opposite. It makes us less safe by 
targeting immigrant communities and closing off America from our 
neighbors.
  American taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for 
President Trump's xenophobic anti-immigrant agenda.
