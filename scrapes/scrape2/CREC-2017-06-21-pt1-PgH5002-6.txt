                     NATIONAL ASKING SAVES KIDS DAY

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, today, June 21, is National Asking Saves 
Kids Day, or ASK Day.
  Every 6 days in our country, a child under the age of 15 dies from an 
accidental gunshot. Each year, more than 600 children sustain nonfatal 
injuries from an unintentional gunshot, and 80 percent of all 
unintentional firearm deaths of children under the age of 15 occur in a 
home. This is a national crisis, and we need to stop it.
  Since 2000, the ASK Campaign has encouraged parents to ask before 
their child visits another home whether there is an unlocked gun in the 
House.
  Today is the first day of summer, the season when kids spend more 
time at a friend's house, so later today I will be introducing a 
resolution to officially designate June 21 as National ASK Day, to 
promote children's health and gun safety.
  This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is an 
issue important to every family all across our country. Let's get the 
job done and do something that will save the lives of children all 
across our country. Just ask.
