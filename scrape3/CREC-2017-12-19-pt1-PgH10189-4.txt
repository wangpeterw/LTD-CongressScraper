                     THE REPUBLICAN TAX BILL IS BAD

  (Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, in a few hours from now, the Republican 
Conference is going to bring forth a tax bill. This bill will 
redistribute wealth from working Americans up to the very richest 
people in our country. It will result in massive deficits. It will 
result in a starvation of the government to stop it from doing critical 
things that it needs to do to afford the expenses of our country and to 
help Americans lead better lives.
  But after it is all said and done, after that is done, Mr. Speaker, 
it is going to do at least three more things that are very, very bad.
  One of them is that the corporations that get all this money and the 
wealthy individuals will, one, do stock buybacks and promote their 
personal wealth. They will give each other bonuses to give each other 
greater personal wealth.
  They will have more money to do more mergers to concentrate markets 
even more so that we have more monopoly and oligopoly around, and they 
will buy political influence to further corrupt our democratic 
government.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a bad thing, and I am looking forward to a big, 
strong ``no.''
