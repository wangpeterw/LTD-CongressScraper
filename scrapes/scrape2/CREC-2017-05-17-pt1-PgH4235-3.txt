                      THE UNITED STATES AND TAIWAN

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the mutual relationship between the United 
States and Taiwan--enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 and 
reinforced by the Six Assurances of 1982--has endured, due to our 
shared beliefs in democratic government, freedom of expression, the 
rule of law, and a market economy.
  It is my hope that this relationship will continue to deepen and 
strengthen in all areas. I hope the Trump administration will move 
expeditiously with a military sales package that will help to guarantee 
Taiwan's security and freedom for the future.
  The people of Taiwan have great friends in the people of the United 
States. I know many of my colleagues will join me in expressing our 
shared desire to work together with our friends on the old and new 
challenges that Taiwan faces.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish President Tsai and the people of Taiwan all the 
best on their first anniversary of her administration.
