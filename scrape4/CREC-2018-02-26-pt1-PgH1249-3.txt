                  RECOGNIZING MONSIGNOR WILLIAM LINDER

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, there are few Americans who dedicate their 
lives completely to rebuilding an inner-city community.
  Imagine a person who seeks no personal recognition but is imbued with 
deep faith and a future they help guide. Imagine their drive arising 
from their mission to serve others.
  One of these rare souls is Monsignor William Linder of Newark, New 
Jersey, the founder of the New Community Corporation, which celebrates 
its 50th anniversary this year. Monsignor Linder's adult life is a 
powerful and pioneering example of a modern wise man who planted a 
church in the public square to transform America.
  As a young priest in the 1960s, he was assigned to Newark's Central 
Ward amidst riots and racial tension. This was a divisive and uncertain 
time, yet he took it upon himself to walk hand in hand with the people 
of Newark who desperately needed someone to believe in them and inspire 
a better way forward.
  Linder listened to the people, and together they organized for 
affordable housing, civil rights, and a better way of life for all. His 
determination and boundless faith helped New Community achieve major 
revitalization.

  Without question, New Community provides a reliable blueprint for 
rebuilding America's most neglected spaces. America is blessed, indeed, 
humbled, and filled with gratitude for Linder's life of service.
  Thank you, Monsignor Linder. You are a good and faithful servant and 
living example of the commitment real progress requires.
