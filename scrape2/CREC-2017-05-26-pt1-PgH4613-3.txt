                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We thank You also for the many blessings we enjoy as Americans. While 
listening to constituents, may the needs of all citizens be made known, 
so that the laws and policies to be enacted by the Members of this 
people's House might best serve the Nation.
  Bless the families of those men and women who have served our Nation 
in uniform, and paid the ultimate price of defending the ideals of the 
United States. May all Americans be inspired to be of service however 
we might be able.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
