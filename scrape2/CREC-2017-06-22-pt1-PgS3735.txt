     Commerce, and Navigation;
       Whereas the United States-Republic of Korea alliance was

     alliance, while it plans to implement the domestic procedures 
     to uphold democratic, legal, and procedural legitimacy and 
     transparency;
       Whereas the People's Republic of China has engaged in an 
     unprecedented campaign of economic pressure on the Republic 
     of Korea in retaliation for the decision by the United

     official visit to the United States since his election as 
     President; and
       Whereas the United States Government looks forward to 
     continuing to deepen our enduring partnership with the 
     Republic of Korea on economic, security, and cultural issues, 
     as well as embracing new opportunities for new partnership 
     and cooperation on emerging regional and global challenges: 
     Now, therefore, be it
