  HIGHLIGHTING THE WORK OF THE CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA DIGITAL LEARNING 
                               FOUNDATION

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this morning I was at the 
Central Pennsylvania Digital Learning Foundation in Duncansville to 
speak about my work on the House Committee on Education and the 
Workforce.
  The Central Pennsylvania Digital Learning Foundation Charter School 
offers a customizable cyber education for students throughout 
Pennsylvania. Its learning experience connects, engages, and empowers 
every student to be successful in reaching their academic and personal 
goals for today and tomorrow.
  This school was developed from the ground up by the area 
superintendents in collaboration with Intermediate Unit 8. The IU8 was 
created to furnish a broad range of educational services to the 35 
public schools, 5 area vocational-technical schools, 2 charter schools, 
and approximately 81 non public schools in west central and 
southwestern Pennsylvania.
  Mr. Speaker, we must understand that there are numerous educational 
environments, and many students thrive in a cyber school-style setup. 
The IU8 is doing tremendous work to ensure that students who choose a 
cyber school education are receiving the same quality education as 
their peers who attend brick-and-mortar schools. I am proud of the work 
they are doing.
