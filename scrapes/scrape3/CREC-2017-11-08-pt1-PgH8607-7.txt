                   79TH ANNIVERSARY OF KRISTALLNACHT

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House

for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, November 9 marks the 79th anniversary 
of Kristallnacht. Referred to as the ``Night of Broken Glass,'' the 
German high command issued orders to target Jews because of their 
faith.
  Disguised as normal citizens, members of the SS and the Gestapo 
destroyed hundreds of synagogues, looted and vandalized thousands of 
businesses, arrested tens of thousands of innocent civilians, and 
killed nearly 100. This atrocity was a harbinger of one of history's 
darkest periods, the Holocaust.
  The anniversary of this grave tragedy serves as a constant reminder 
of what happens when hatred and bigotry flood the minds of our world. 
When evil is met with silence and indifference, all of mankind suffers.
  Unfortunately, the world has not learned a lesson from the past. 
Anti-Semitism has seen a troubling rise across the globe, and we must 
continue our fight toward ending this brutal chapter of intolerance.
  Mr. Speaker, November 9 serves as a reminder of this tragedy, but 
also as an opportunity to fight this hatred and all forms of hatred, 
and vow to never let such an atrocity to ever occur again.
