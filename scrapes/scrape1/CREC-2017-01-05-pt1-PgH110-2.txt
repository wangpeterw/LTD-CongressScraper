                             ACA AND WOMEN

  (Ms. DelBENE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, at this very moment, House and Senate 
leaders are working on a dangerous plan to dismantle the Affordable 
Care Act and strip more than 20 million Americans of their health 
insurance. And if they succeed, it will have devastating consequences 
for our constituents, particularly women.
  Repealing the ACA means allowing insurance companies to charge women 
more, simply for being a woman; endangering access to care for 65 
million women with preexisting conditions; and stripping more than 55 
million women of free preventative care, like birth control and cancer 
screenings.
  It is easy to forget how broken the system was before the Affordable 
Care Act. But make no mistake: dismantling it now means being a woman 
will once again be treated as a preexisting condition. It will mean 
fewer options, less access, and higher costs for tens of millions of 
women.
  We should be building on the progress we have made, not turning back 
the clock. Women deserve better.
