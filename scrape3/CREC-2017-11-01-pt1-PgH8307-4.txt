                CONGRATULATING OAKWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Oakwood Elementary 
School in Wayzata for being recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School 
for academic excellence.
  This is a big honor. It is a big deal. I visited Oakwood myself, and 
only eight schools in Minnesota have received this recognition this 
year. That is because exemplary, high-performing schools like Oakwood 
rank among the highest performing schools with top scores in State 
assessments.
  One important note worth mentioning is that Oakwood Elementary School 
has done significant work addressing the achievement gap in their 
community so that every one of their students has what they need to be 
successful.
  Mr. Speaker, every one of Oakwood's teachers, staff, students, and 
parents should be commended for this accomplishment. Congratulations, 
again, to Oakwood Elementary School for being named a National Blue 
Ribbon School.
