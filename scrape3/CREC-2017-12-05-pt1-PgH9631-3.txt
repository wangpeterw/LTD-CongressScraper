                            OPEN ENROLLMENT

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind every American 
that the window to purchase health insurance on healthcare.gov will 
close in 10 days. I encourage anyone who doesn't get insurance through 
a job or government program to apply before December 15.
  Financial assistance is available, and the Department of Health and 
Human Services has said before that 8 out of 10 consumers qualify for a 
plan that costs less than $75 a month.
  Although the signup period was cut in half by the Trump 
administration, nearly 2.8 million people have already enrolled so far 
this year compared to 2.1 million this time last year. That is an 
increase of 33 percent, and this doesn't include numbers from States 
that have their own exchange.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land, 
and I urge my Republican colleagues not to harm the ACA by including 
provisions in the tax bill and, instead, work with Democrats to improve 
the law.
  Millions of Americans depend on us to do the right thing, Mr. 
Speaker.
