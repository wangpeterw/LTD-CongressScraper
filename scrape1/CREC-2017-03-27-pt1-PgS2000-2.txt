 SENATE RESOLUTION 99--RECOGNIZING THE 11 AFRICAN-AMERICAN SOLDIERS OF 
   THE 333RD FIELD ARTILLERY BATTALION WHO WERE MASSACRED IN WERETH, 
        BELGIUM, DURING THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE IN DECEMBER 1944

  Mr. MANCHIN (for himself and Mr. Cotton) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:

                               S. Res. 99

       Whereas, in December 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge 
     in Belgium, soldiers of the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion, 
     an African-American unit of the Army, were operating in 
     support of the 106th Infantry Division when the 106th 
     Infantry Division and the soldiers from the 333rd Field 
     Artillery Battalion were overrun;
       Whereas, months after the Battle of the Bulge, the frozen 
     bodies of 11 soldiers from the 333rd Field Artillery 
     Battalion were found near the Belgian hamlet of Wereth;
       Whereas the bodies of the 11 soldiers were--
       (1) identified as James Stewart of West Virginia, Due 
     Turner of Arkansas, Curtis Adams of South Carolina, Mager 
     Bradley of Mississippi, George Davis, Jr. of Alabama, Thomas 
     Forte of Mississippi, Robert Green of Georgia, James 
     Leatherwood of Mississippi, Nathaniel Moss of Texas, George 
     Motten of Texas, and William Pritchett of Alabama;
       (2) examined by Army Medical Corps officials; and
       (3) found to have been stabbed, shot, and struck by blunt 
     force;
       Whereas the massacre of the 11 African-American soldiers of 
     the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion in Wereth remains unknown 
     to the vast majority of the people of the United States;
       Whereas, in 2004, a permanent monument in Wereth was 
     dedicated to the 11 African-American soldiers of the 333rd 
     Field Artillery Battalion who lost their lives in Wereth 
     during the Battle of the Bulge in the effort to defeat 
     fascism and defend freedom; and
       Whereas the 11 patriots have become known as the ``Wereth 
     11'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate, on behalf of the United States, 
     recognizes the dedicated service and ultimate sacrifice of 
     the 11 African-American soldiers of the 333rd Field Artillery 
     Battalion who were massacred in Wereth, Belgium, during the 
     Battle of the Bulge in December 1944.
