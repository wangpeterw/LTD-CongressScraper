                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, You are our strength and always ready to help us. 
Uphold our lawmakers with Your powerful hands. Lord, let Your presence 
be felt by them as You guide them in these challenging times.
  Give them the wisdom to do Your will, finding nourishment and 
reassurance in their fellowship with You. Help them to do their best in 
life's daylight, for the night comes when no one can work.
  Empower our Senators to grow in grace and in a deeper knowledge of 
You. May they continue to prosper and be in health, even as their souls 
prosper. Inspire them to be strong and full of courage, ever confident 
in Your grace and mercy.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
