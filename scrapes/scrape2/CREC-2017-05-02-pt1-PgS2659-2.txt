                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God of love and laughter, we thank You for all of Your benefits. Your 
mercies to us are new each day. You send the sunshine and the rain. You 
provide us with seed time and harvest. You protect us from dangers and 
inspire us with Your abiding presence.
  Lord, thank You for providing our lawmakers with the gift of Your 
peace, even in the midst of life's storms. Supply all their needs from 
the abundance of Your celestial riches. Transform their gratitude into 
service to those who must daily experience the pain of privation and 
despair. Help us all to express our faith in You with deeds of love.
  And, Lord, please be with the Larkin family during this season of 
grief.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
