     RECOGNIZING MONTEREY COUNTY AND SANTA CRUZ COUNTY FARM BUREAUS

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Farm Bureaus 
of Monterey County and Santa Cruz County.
  This year, those farm bureaus will mark 100 years of serving our 
agriculture communities across the central coast of California. We know 
that those in agriculture are consistently evolving as they constantly 
contend with Mother Nature, mandates, immigration, and the ever-
changing market.
  Fortunately, the local farm bureaus' leadership and consultation has 
always been there to help our over 600 farmers stay competitive and 
keep our communities strong. The farm bureaus are an essential 
ingredient as to why our number one industry on the central coast is 
agriculture and why my home can claim the title of being the berry bowl 
and salad bowl of the world.
  I thank and recognize the Santa Cruz County and Monterey County Farm 
Bureaus for their past, present, and future work for our agriculture 
industry and for our communities that feed our families throughout our 
Nation and the world.
