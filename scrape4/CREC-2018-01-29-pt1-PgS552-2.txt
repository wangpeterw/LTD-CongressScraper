     United States to an ally, the Republic of Korea, to support, 
     participate in, and help ensure the safety and security of

     verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean 
     Peninsula; and
       (5) wishes every success in preparing and hosting the 
     Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 to the government and
