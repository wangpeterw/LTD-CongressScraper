              RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF COMMITTEE ON ETHICS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following 
resignation as a member of the Committee on Ethics:

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2018.
     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Ryan: Thank you for the privilege of serving 
     for the past 5 years on the House Ethics Committee. While 
     few, if any, members seek this assignment, the collegiality 
     of the members coupled with the

     seriousness of the jurisdiction have made it an experience I 
     will treasure.
       When I became Chairperson of the Committee on Oversight and 
     Government Reform I knew I would not be able to keep all 
     other committee assignments to include Judiciary, 
     Intelligence and Ethics. Four committee assignments, 
     including a Chairmanship, is a challenging workload.
       I was happy to finish out the calendar year and conclude 
     some matters then pending before the Committee.
       Accordingly, I tender my resignation from the House Ethics 
     Committee pending your designation of a replacement. Thank 
     you again for this opportunity and thank you to my colleagues 
     on the Committee for their hard work and friendship.
           Sincerely,
                                                       Trey Gowdy,
                                               Member of Congress.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the resignation is 
accepted.
  There was no objection.
