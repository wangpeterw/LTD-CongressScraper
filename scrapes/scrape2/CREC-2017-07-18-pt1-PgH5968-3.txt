 MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING OFFICER MIOSOTIS FAMILIA AND STATE TROOPER 
                               JOEL DAVIS

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, it is with both sadness and pride that I 
rise today to honor the memory of a leader, a hard worker, and an 
outstanding member of our community, Police Officer Miosotis Familia.
  Officer Familia served in the New York City Police Department for 12 
years. She grew up in Washington Heights, a neighborhood that I 
represent in Manhattan. On the Fourth of July, her life was tragically 
taken in an act of violence.
  Her mother, Adriana, was one of her best friends, and the two 
constantly spent time together. Officer Familia had three children of 
her own, Genesis, Delilah, and Peter. She gave them all the love her 
mother had given her in the past.
  Today, Officer Familia's legacy lives on through her family, the 
police officers of the 42nd precinct, and all her loved ones, including 
all New Yorkers.
  My New York colleagues and I stand here on the House floor to salute 
the memory and the legacy of Officer Miosotis Familia, as well as other 
officers who have been killed in the line of duty--including State 
Trooper Joel Davis, who, about a week ago, was also tragically killed 
in upstate New York.
  I now invite my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence in their 
honor.
