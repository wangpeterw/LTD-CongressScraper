10680,topic-id,184,"Mr.Speaker, I rise on behalf of millions of students and graduates in this country that are struggling to finance their higher education and pay off student loans.  Yesterday I invited Izeah Garcia to the President's address. Izeah is an advocate for increasing accessibility and lowering the cost of a higher education. Izeah and I share a similar story: sons of hardworking immigrant parents, and the first in our families to attend a university, both at UC Santa Barbara, located in my district.  Like many students today struggling to afford the rising cost of tuition, we relied on student loans to put us through college. In the President's speech last night, we didn't hear one mention of the over $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis.  I urge this administration and Congress to commit to addressing the unsustainable future of student debt by allowing students to refinance their debt at a lower interest rate and expanding access to Pell grants. We can ensure that every student is afforded the opportunity to pursue a higher education and to better their lives, their communities, and our country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1449.txt,99999999999999,1930,2017.0,1.0,February

10704,topic-id,189,"Mr.President, I would like to express my support for the nomination of Linda McMahon to the position of Administrator of the U.Small Business  Linda McMahon is an interesting candidate for this position. As the cofounder and former CEO of the WWE, she built a small regional business into an entertainment behemoth. Along the way she struggled to meet payroll, market the business, learn State and Federal regulatory regimes, manage a traveling workforce, learn new media platforms, and navigate new revenue streams.  Each of these accomplishments is impressive. But what makes Linda McMahon unique for this role is the fact that, on her path to success, she made serious enough mistakes that she was forced to declare personal bankruptcy and apply for government assistance. I think having an Administrator who has started her own small business and met and overcame significant challenges along her way is of tremendous value. Having been in the trenches herself, she will really be able to evaluate the efficacy of current small business programs, and she may very well be able to suggest substantive improvements or even new directions.  I was also particularly impressed with ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1138-2.txt,,1930,2017.0,14.0,February
10520,topic-id,488,"Mr.President, I rise to pay tribute to Thomas Starzl, the pioneer in the field of organ transplantation who impacted the lives of thousands directly and indirectly. Starzl died on March 4, 2017, 1 week shy of his 91st birthday.  To say Stazrl was a remarkable surgeon, researcher, or physician does not begin to describe this man or the contributions he made. He was a visionary who created and then transformed an entire field of medicine. He performed the first liver transplant in 1963, the first heart-liver transplant in 1984, and led a team conducting a five-organ transplant in 1987. In 2007, at the age of 80, Starzl visited with me to seek research funding for the hand transplant program at the University of He never stopped envisioning what more could be done or striving to achieve it.  The late Senator Robert Kennedy once said, ``only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.'' Starzl was not afraid to fail, and through his determination and the innovation and advances he brought forth, organ transplantation preserved human life, and the University of Pittsburgh became the busiest transplant center in the world. Knowing that the actual surgery is only one part of a successful transplantation, Starzl worked to develop immunosuppressant therapies and played a role in creating tacrolimus, which remains the most widely used immunosuppressant drug in the world. He also believed that it was his obligation to train the next generation of transplant surgeons. Today approximately 90 percent of transplant centers are headed by surgeons Starzl directly trained or by surgeons who learned from surgeons Starzl trained.  Over his decades of service, Starzl profoundly impacted many lives and families, including my own. Our family will always be grateful for the extraordinary care Starzl provided for my father, during his second term as Governor of In June of 1993, Starzl oversaw Governor Casey's exceedingly rare heart and liver double transplant surgery. My family cherished the 7 additional years we had with my father.  Among the many accolades Starzl received was being ranked 213th in the book ``1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking the Men and Women Who Shaped the Millennium.'' Published in 1998, this book named the people who had the greatest impact on the world over the previous 1,000 years. Starzl's inclusion speaks to the enormous impact he had on so many lives.  Starzl's passing leaves a void, but we know the foundation he built for organ transplantation will endure through the many lives he saved, the surgeons he trained, and the high standards he set for quality of care. In the statement released by his family, it was noted that he ``was a force of nature that swept all those around him into his orbit, challenging those that surrounded him to strive to match his superhuman feats of focus, will and compassion.'' His ``superhuman feats'' will remain an inspiration for those in the medical profession and beyond.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2422.txt,1828,1930,2017.0,4.0,February
10586,topic-id,441,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction I want to commend my colleague from Texas (Mr.Smith) for his leadership on this important bill. Mr.Smith, of course, who is now the chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, was, for a number of years, the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and he has a long reputation, much experience in trying to find ways to make the legal system work better for more people all across the country, and this is part of that, because there is a huge cost associated with the abusive lawsuits that have been filed for many years in this country.  Businesses are a popular target for frivolous lawsuits that lack any legal or factual basis. These lawsuits can easily result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and discovery costs. Small businesses oftentimes don't have the financial resources to obtain a dismissal or sometimes even good legal counsel, and, therefore, their only option, in many cases, is to settle the case. In fact, many businesses and other entities put aside--insurance companies do this as well--a nuisance value of many of these cases because they realize so many cases are basically filed for not really legitimate reasons, but because there is a cash payout at the end of this, and some who are able to will actually put that in their budget. But these expenses don't just cost small businesses time and productivity. Too often they force small businesses into bankruptcy, and that means real people lose their jobs. This happens thousands and thousands and thousands of times all across this country.  Mr.Chairman, as chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, I cannot emphasize enough that we absolutely cannot afford to lose any more small businesses in this country and the associated jobs that go with them.  By ensuring that there are penalties for lawyers filing frivolous lawsuits, H.720 will deter abusive litigation practices that pose a real threat to the stability of many small businesses all across this country. After all, small businesses are the backbone of the economy. About 70 percent of the new jobs created in the American economy nowadays are created by small-business folks, so we should do everything we can to make sure that they are successful and able to hire more and more Americans so that we can get this economy moving again.  I urge my colleagues to support H.720. I again thank Mr.Smith for putting forth this very wise and thoughtful legislation which I think will go a long way toward improving the legal system that we have in this country.

10633,topic-id,868,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his extraordinary leadership on this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, H.372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017, would partially repeal a longstanding antitrust exemption established by the McCarran-Ferguson Act with respect to the business of health and dental insurance.  To qualify for this limited antitrust exemption, an insurer must be engaged in the business of insurance regulated by a State that is not designed to boycott, coerce, or intimidate.  While these requirements somewhat constrain anticompetitive conduct, it is clear that they do not preclude the most egregious antitrust violations, such as price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation, by health insurance providers.                              {time}  1500  Health insurers should not be immune from antitrust scrutiny, particularly when they collude to increase prices, reduce availability, or otherwise engage in anticompetitive behavior.  That is why House Democrats passed a measure that is substantively similar to H.372, in 2010, by a vote of 406-19, and in 2009, as well. In 1988, 1992, and 1994, Judiciary Democrats likewise favorably reported legislation to completely repeal the McCarran-Ferguson  While H.372 is only a partial repeal of this exemption, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. But let me be perfectly clear about three things:  First, promoting competition in health insurance markets cannot occur at the expense of the strong protections established by the Affordable Care Act to make health markets more efficient and prohibiting discriminatory insurance policies. These protections are ``textbook measures that help promote competition in the insurance marketplace,'' as Professor Tim Greaney, a leading antitrust expert, testified in 2015.  Second, contrary to President Trump's suggestions on Twitter, repealing McCarran-Ferguson's antitrust exemption for health insurance will not remove State barriers or create new pathways for insurance companies to compete and offer products across State lines.  This simplistic approach to healthcare policy overlooks the fact that the Affordable Care Act already allows States to establish healthcare choice compacts to provide for cross-State insurance sales, while five States have already enacted out-of-State purchasing laws. But these laws have done little to encourage cross-State insurance sales because health insurers are simply not interested in selling these products across State lines.  The barriers to entry into health insurance markets ``are not truly regulatory, they are financial and they are network,'' as Professor Sabrina Corlette of Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute has observed.  Notwithstanding President Trump's exaggerated claims to the contrary, it is also clear that enacting this legislation is not a precondition for Congress[[Page H2270]]authorizing cross-State insurance sales.  My Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee agree, noting in their report on the bill that ``the general consensus, including among witnesses at the most recent Judiciary hearing on the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, is that if Congress decides to allow insurers to sell across State lines, such action does not necessarily require a repeal of McCarran-Ferguson.''  And third, there is no evidence that enacting this bill alone will improve the affordability or availability of health insurance.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the effect of H.372 on health insurance premiums ``would probably be quite small,'' and enacting the bill will have ``no significant net effect on the premiums that private insurers would charge for health or dental insurance.''  Additionally, because the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not apply to mergers, H.372 will not prevent further concentration in health insurance markets.  The truth is, Mr.Speaker, if Republicans were serious about actually enforcing the antitrust laws, they would fully fund the antitrust agencies. But as we know from the Trump administration's budget blueprint, Republicans plan to make deep cuts to the funding of enforcement agencies like the Justice Department, likely to the detriment of economic opportunity and fair competition.  In addition, President Trump has not even nominated heads to the antitrust agencies. According to the Partnership for Public Service, even though he has been in office for 60 days, President Trump has not picked a nominee for 497 of the 553 positions requiring Senate confirmation.  Worse still, President Trump is reportedly considering appointing a former lobbyist for a health insurance giant to run the Justice Department's antitrust division, which is tasked by Congress ``to protect economic freedom and opportunity by promoting free and fair competition in the marketplace.''  Citing lobbying reports, the International Business Times notes that this particular lobbyist participated in the ``antitrust issues associated with Anthem's proposed acquisition of Cigna,'' and his firm received $375,000 in lobbying fees.  Just last month, the Justice Department won an important lawsuit initiated under the Obama administration to block this merger, which, according to the Department of Justice, would have harmed consumers through increased health insurance prices, while stifling the exact innovation that is necessary to lower healthcare costs.  It is unsurprising that President Trump's corporate cabinet will probably include yet another lobbyist that will pursue an extreme agenda on behalf of special interests. But the significance of this potential appointment cannot be overstated and absolutely will not result in lower prices or more choices for the American people.  In closing, Mr.Speaker, while I support H.372 as a complement to the Affordable Care Act, I agree with the ranking member that this bill is not a solution to improving the availability or affordability of health insurance.

10476,topic-id,1020,"Thank you very much for yielding to me.  Mr.Speaker, I am very pleased to join my colleagues and people throughout the United States to celebrate Black History It may come as a surprise to some that Black History Month is also celebrated in Canada and the United Kingdom, although they do so in the United Kingdom in the month of  Thanks to the hard work and persistence of Carter Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, known today as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the celebration of Black history was inaugurated in 1926. In response to Mr.Woodson's advocacy, it was to be for 1 week, the second week in February, in order to envelope the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, February 12, and Frederick Douglass, February 14.  First proposed by students at Kent University in 1969 and 1970, the week was officially expanded to a month in 1976. Gerald Ford was President at the time. When the month was established, President Ford urged the country to ``honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans.'' There is a lot of talk about health care these days, and in no area has the contributions of African Americans been more neglected and dishonored as much as in the field of health care.  How many people are aware of the contributions of Charles Drew who unlocked the secrets that led to the ability to perform blood transfusions; or Daniel Hale Williams who performed the first successful open-heart surgery; or Samuel Kountz who performed the first successful kidney transplant not done on identical twins? Because of these and many other slights in many other fields, Mr.Speaker, I have not always celebrated this occasion with pleasure.  During those discussions back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, I, and many others, felt that the appropriate action was not just to expand from 1 week to a month but to mandate the incorporation of African-Americans' contributions and achievements throughout the curricula of all of our schools year round.  But, with each passing day, I grow more and more appreciative and respective of a lesson taught in 1 Corinthians 11:13, which I share with you in Jim Clyburn's version. ``When I was a child, young and inexperienced, I spoke with the reasoning and understanding of a child, but as I grew and matured, I put those childish thoughts, expressions, and ways behind me.''  I have come to understand, Mr.Speaker, that Black History Month is not only about celebrating past achievements and contributions. It is also a time for reflection and introspection.                              {time}  1945  Aristotle once intoned: ``A life without contemplation is not worth living.''  I have spent a lot of introspective moments over the last several weeks. Over the last several days, I have reflected on the comments made by Martin Luther King, Jr., at the annual meeting of the Medical Committee for Human Rights back in 1966, when he said: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.''  That is what was on my mind when I addressed this House on the day that we passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care On that occasion, I referred to the Affordable Care Act as the civil rights act of the 21st century.  It may seem a bit odd to some to hear the Affordable Care Act referred to as a civil rights act, but that is exactly what it is. The Affordable Care Act outlawed discrimination against children with preexisting conditions, outlawed discrimination against people with disabilities, and outlawed discrimination against women just because they are women.  Mr.Speaker, I want to believe that we have grown and matured beyond where we were when our country allowed insurance companies to discriminate against women with breast cancer[[Page H1119]]and men with prostate cancer. I would like to believe, Mr.Speaker, that we have put behind us the childish practice of kicking children off of their family insurance policies as soon as they turn 21, even if they are still in school or have not yet found employment. Mr.Speaker, what could be more childish and immature than allowing insurance companies to deny benefits to the sick and disabled in order to gain big bonuses and payouts for executives?  These arguments are not new. In fact, they are reminiscent of an age-old debate.  Fifty years ago, during my years of student protest, there were those who urged us to slow down. You are pushing too hard, too fast, they would say. Some of those who wanted a slower approach claimed to be on our side, like those eight White ministers who implored Martin Luther King, Jr., to slow down, arguing that Christianity took 2,000 years to accomplish all it has. Those ministers believed that the escalation of marches and demonstrations to secure civil rights was unwise and untimely.  In 1963, while sitting in the Birmingham city jail, King started penning a letter that, of course, he finished after leaving jail, but in that letter he dealt with the whole issue of time. In his letter, King said: ``Time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively.''  He continued: ``More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful word and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people.''  King continued: ``Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitably; it comes through the tireless efforts of men''--and, I might add, women--``willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that time is always ripe to do right.''  I believe these words ring true today, in our current situation. Our Nation has waited for nearly a century to find a way to bring all its citizens into the healthcare system. The time was ripe to do right for the American people.

10583,topic-id,534,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong opposition to H.720, the so-called Lawsuit Abuse Reduction  This bill amends rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in ways that will chill the advancement of civil rights claims and increase exponentially the volume and costs of litigation in the Federal courts.  These concerns are not hypothetical. H.720 restores the deeply flawed version of rule 11 in effect from 1983 to 1993 in two ways: by requiring mandatory sanctions for even unintentional violations rather than leaving the imposition of sanctions to the court's discretion, as is currently the case; and secondly, by eliminating the current rule's 21-day safe harbor provision, which allows the defending party to correct or withdraw allegedly offending submissions.  Simply put, H.720 will have a disastrous impact on the administration of justice in numerous ways. To begin with, the bill will chill legitimate civil rights litigation, which, to me, of course, is very important.  Civil rights cases often raise novel legal arguments, which made such cases particularly susceptible to sanction motions under the 1983 rule. For example, a Federal Judicial Center study found that the incidence of rule 11 motions under the 1983 rule was ``higher in civil rights cases than in some other types of cases.''  Another study showed that, while civil rights cases comprised about 11 percent of the cases filed, more than 22 percent of the cases in which sanctions had been imposed were, in fact, civil rights cases.  Under the 1983 rule, civil rights cases were clearly disadvantaged. Yet, H.720 would reserve this problematic regime.  Although the bill's rule of construction is a welcome acknowledgment of the problem, it does nothing to prevent defendants from using rule 11 as a weapon to discourage civil rights plaintiffs. Even a landmark case like Brown v. Board of Education might not have been pursued had H.720's changes to rule 11 been in effect at that time, because the legal arguments in the case were novel and not based on then-existing law.  In addition, H.720 will substantially increase the amount, cost, and intensity of civil litigation and create more grounds for unnecessary delay and harassment in the courtroom itself.  By making sanctions mandatory and having no safe harbor, the 1983 rule spawned a cottage industry of rule 11 litigation. Each party had a financial incentive to tie up the other in rule 11 proceedings.  We heard testimony on a previous version of this bill that almost one-third of all Federal lawsuits during the decade that the 1983 rule was in effect were burdened by such satellite litigation, where the parties tried the underlying case and then put each side's counsel on trial.  Finally, H.720 strips the judiciary of its discretion and independence. H.720 overrides judicial independence by removing the discretion that rule 11 currently gives judges in determining whether to impose sanctions and what type of sanctions would be most appropriate. It also circumvents the painstakingly thorough Rules Enabling Act process that Congress established more than 80 years ago.  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing this highly problematic legislation.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Not surprisingly, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking body for the judicial branch charged with proposing amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under the careful, deliberate process specified in the Rules Enabling Act, opposes this measure, noting that it creates a cure worse than the problem it is meant to solve.  Likewise, the American Bar Association opposes this legislation, as do numerous consumer and environmental groups, including: Public Citizen, the Alliance for Justice, the Center for Justice and Democracy, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Earthjustice, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and six other major organizations.

10595,topic-id,450,"Mr.Chairman, I am very concerned that H.720 may have a serious, deleterious impact on the ability of individuals to protect their civil and constitutional rights in Federal court. This is a point that has been emphasized on this side ever since we have started examining, more carefully, H.720. Accordingly, my amendment would simply exempt these types of cases from the bill.  Based on a decade of experience with the 1983 version of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we know that the civil rights cases were, in fact, disproportionately impacted because they often raised novel arguments.  For example, a 1991 Federal Judicial Center study found that the incidence of rule 11 motions was ``higher in civil rights cases than in some other types of cases.'' Another study shows that, while civil rights cases comprised only 11 percent of the Federal cases filed, more than 22 percent of the cases in which sanctions had been imposed were, in fact, civil rights cases.  The bill contains a rule of construction intended to clarify that ``it not be construed to bar the assertion of new claims or defenses or remedies, including those arising under civil rights laws or the Constitution.''  The inclusion of this language is an acknowledgment of the disproportionate impact that the 1983 rule had on civil rights cases, and we should applaud--and I am sure we do--its intent.  Nevertheless, I fear this rule of construction, by itself, will not prevent defendants from using rule 11 as a weapon to dissuade civil rights plaintiffs from pursuing their claims.                              {time}  1015  My amendment makes an explicit exception for civil rights and constitutional actions. As a result, litigants will be clearly aware of its existence and will not be able to force opposing parties into satellite litigation when the case is brought under a civil rights law.  This amendment is necessary to avoid even the possibility of a chilling effect that the revisions made by the bill to rule 11 could have on those advocating for civil rights and constitutional law protections. As the late Robert Carter, a former United States judge for the Southern District of New York, who earlier in his career represented one of the plaintiffs in the Brown v. Board of Education case, said of the 1983 version of rule 11:  ``I have no doubt that the Supreme Court's opportunity to pronounce separate schools inherently unequal in Brown v. Board of Education would have been delayed for a decade had my colleagues and I been required, upon pain of potential sanctions, to plead our legal theory explicitly from the start.''

10629,topic-id,546,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in qualified support of H.372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, but I do not endorse the majority's exaggerated claims regarding the bill's impact on the affordability and availability of health insurance.  H.372 would partially repeal the limited Federal antitrust exemption for the business of insurance established by the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. Specifically, the bill only permits Federal antitrust enforcement with regard to the business of health insurance.  Now, House Democrats have long supported a full repeal of McCarran-Ferguson's antitrust exemption for all insurers, not just for health insurers. In 2010, under a Democratic House majority, we passed legislation to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson exemption for health insurers by a vote of 406-19, even though House Republicans had not previously supported moving any version of a McCarran-Ferguson repeal bill.  But let me be clear. Enacting H.372 would in no way be a substitute for the many health insurance guarantees of the Affordable Care The two things are completely separate. To begin with, enacting H.372 would not significantly improve healthcare affordability or coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.372's effect on health insurance premiums would probably be quite small, and enacting the bill would have no significant net effect on the premiums the private insurers would charge for health or dental insurance. That is according to the Congressional Budget  The Consumers Union observes that the application of the antitrust laws to some health insurance activity, by itself, is simply not enough to create a vibrant insurance market because our long experience shows you can't expect a healthcare system to run effectively on competition alone. That is the Consumers  Likewise, the majority's claim that enacting H.372 would create major new competition by allowing cross-State insurance sales is unavailing. Current law, including the Affordable Care Act, already allows States to agree with each other to allow cross-State insurance sales.  Enabling Federal antitrust agencies to police certain forms of anticompetitive conduct will not, in and of itself, incentivize health insurers to offer products across State lines beyond the incentives that already exist for offering such products. It just won't happen by itself. Whatever the incentives for health insurers to offer such products, they have little to do with Federal antitrust law or enforcement.  Finally, enacting H.372 would not ensure that the Affordable Care Act's prohibitions against discrimination and limits on premium growth would remain in place. H.372 only applies to certain anticompetitive conduct and does not preserve or enhance existing protections for consumers of health insurance. For instance, it does not prohibit discrimination by health insurers on the basis of preexisting conditions, nor does it reduce premium growth or require health insurers to be accountable for price increases.  Repeal of the antitrust exemption for health insurance is a complement to and not a replacement for the Affordable Care Act's many consumer protections. This is not an either-or situation. We need H.372 and the Affordable Care Act to be in place to maximize benefits, improve quality, and lower costs for consumers.  So while I support the bill with some reluctance, I take issue with the majority's rhetoric. It is very important that we set the record straight here.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.[[Page H2269]]    ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2267-2.txt,229,LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,21.0,January

So I want to thank my friends on the other side for helping us out. This is great. We passed something like this a few years ago, and we were very proud that it was an overwhelming vote.  This is a very important step forward. The Affordable Care Act is not going to be affected in any kind of negative way, and that is why I am eager to join with those who are going to be voting for H.372.

Instead, the Republican Congress is trying to weaken one of the gun laws on the books--the NICS Improvement Amendments This is the law passed unanimously by Congress after the Virginia Tech massacre and signed into law in 2008 by President George  This law says that every Federal agency needs to let the FBI NICS background check system know when the agency has information about people who fall within the legal prohibitions on gun possession. Everyone agreed we needed to get these records into the NICS system, especially records about those who are seriously mentally unstable, such as the Virginia Tech shooter. That man had a history of mental illness, but he was able to buy guns and kill 32 people because his records were not in the background check system known as  There is a longstanding Federal prohibition on gun possession by those who are suffering from mental illness. This prohibition is so well established that the late Justice Antonin Scalia cited it in the Supreme Court's Heller decision as an example of a restriction that is presumptively lawful and consistent with the Second  There have been tragic cases where people with serious mental illnesses have used guns to cause great harm. The Newtown, CT, shooter showed signs of severe mental health problems that went untreated before he killed 20 students and 6 educators at Sandy Hook Elementary The Tucson, AZ, shooter, who shot Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and killed six others, was diagnosed after the shooting with schizophrenia. And it was 9 years ago today when a gunman who had been diagnosed and treated for mental illness killed 5 people and injured 17 in a classroom building at Northern Illinois University in  About two-thirds of shooting deaths each year are suicides. Last year, there were more than 21,000 suicides by gun. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that ``about 90% of individuals who die by suicide experience mental illness.''  Mental illness is a challenging issue for our society. I have worked to expand treatment and coverage for mental illness, including through the Affordable Care Act, one of the most important single laws we have ever passed to address mental illness. I wish those who are trying to repeal this commonsense gun safety regulation would drop that effort and join us in stopping this repeal of the Affordable Care We need more and better services for people with mental illness.  The reality is that the gun laws on the books are narrowly drawn when it comes to mental illness and so is the rule we are being asked to repeal today. Current Federal law says that a person who has been ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is prohibited from gun possession. The phrase ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is defined in the law as a determination by ``a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease: (1) is a danger to himself or others; or (2) lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs.''  The 2008 NICS Improvement law, signed into law by President George Bush, directed Federal agencies to send their relevant records to the NICS system. Last year, the Social Security Administration issued a rule to implement this law after concluding that certain determinations by the Social Security Administration qualify as an adjudication of mental defectiveness.  Let me explain what the SSA rule says. Under this rule, starting in December of this year, the Social Security Administration will begin sending to NICS--the body which gathers information and records for background checks before the possession of firearms--the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of people who meet each of the five threshold criteria. The person must be between the ages of 18 and 65, have filed a claim with SSA for benefits based on disability, have been diagnosed with a serious, long-term mental disorder, have been determined by SSA to be disabled and unable to perform substantial work because of the mental disorder, and have been subject to determination by the Social Security Administration that the mental disorder is so serious that the person needs to have a representative appointed to manage the person's benefits.  This is not a situation where the Social Security Administration would notify NICS just because a person can't balance his checkbook. There must be a seriously debilitating, medically diagnosed mental illness involved.  The rule is prospective only. Current Social Security disability beneficiaries are not subject to it. The rule is predicted to cover about 75,000 Americans, once it takes effect, out of the estimated 10 million suffering from a serious mental illness.  I might add here for the record, I do not suggest that every person who has any form of mental illness is a danger. In fact, exactly the opposite is true. But we do know that those who suffer from serious mental conditions many times are engaged in violent conduct and many times with horrible results when they have firearms.  The rule we are being asked to repeal on the floor of the Senate provides for advance notice of the Social Security Administration determination and the right to appeal through an administrative process and in court. A person can[[Page S1139]]obtain relief from the firearms prohibition by having healthcare providers and character witnesses submit statements that the person is not a danger to himself or others.  Every politician claims they want to keep deadly firearms out of the hands of those who are seriously mentally unstable. A statement made by a Republican Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn, the senior Senator from Texas and my counterpart on the Republican side; he said in March 2013:       If there was a common thread in the Virginia Tech, Tucson,      Aurora, and Newtown massacres, it was the mental illness of      the shooter. . . . We should refocus our effort to make sure      the current background check system works to screen out the      dangerously mentally-ill.  Reasonable people can disagree over whether the SSA's rule gets it exactly right. There are mental health groups that have concerns about it, and I respect that. But using the Congressional Review Act is a blunt tool. Instead of fixing the rule, the Congressional Review Act would repeal the rule and--listen to this--permanently bar the Social Security Administration from adopting any substantially similar rule. So it likely would bar the Social Security Administration from ever implementing a rule to submit mental health records to NICS in the future.  If there are problems with this rule, they can be addressed by fixing it. But the Republican response is always repeal first. This time, they want to repeal a rule that doesn't start until December and its repeal would preclude the Social Security Administration from even fixing or positively changing it.  We also had disputes over the process the Department of Veterans Affairs used to submit names of people with mental illness to the same NICS background check system. Last December, we fixed it on a bipartisan basis. We passed language in the 21st Century Cures Act to ensure that a person can have his own doctor and lawyer involved in the process. If the Social Security Administration rule needs fixing, we can fix it too. But this Congressional Review Act is a sledgehammer, not a tool to fix it.  We are being asked to vote today to ban an agency permanently from complying with the NICS law that we enacted in 2008. We are being asked to undermine the gun laws that are on the books.  I urge my colleagues to listen to the opposition of this resolution of disapproval. Read the letter from the U.Conference of Mayors, who say that the Social Security Administration rule ``is critically important to the fabric of our nation's background check system.'' Read the editorials in newspapers across the country that oppose repealing this rule.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Chicago Tribune be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Tribune, 10, 2017]       Editorial: Guns and Mental Illness: Don't Scrap This Rule                          (By Editorial Board)       If someone has a mental illness severe enough that he      cannot work or manage his own money, should he be allowed to      own a gun?       In the waning weeks of his presidency, Barack Obama      answered that question. Motivated by Adam Lanza's bloody      rampage at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that      killed 20 children and six educators in 2012, Obama imposed a      rule that barred gun ownership for people who qualify for      Social Security disability insurance because their mental      illness keeps them from working, and who cannot manage their      benefits. That pool is small--just 75,000       The GOP-led U.House just voted to scrap that rule. Bad      move. The Senate now decides whether to back that bad move.      If it does, President Trump would decide whether to go along      or disagree.       Republican lawmakers hang their case on the argument that      the rule stigmatizes people with disabilities as dangerous.      ``There are people who need help and seek help, but that is      not a criteria for taking away one's constitutional right''      to own a gun, Texas Pete Sessions said.       Sessions implicitly exaggerates the impact of the rule. As      gun control measures go, the scope of this one is narrow. Its      goal is to keep guns out of the hands of people on record as      having a disabling mental disorder. The standard for taking      that gun away is steep--they have to be on Social Security      because their psychiatric disorder keeps them from working,      and they cannot manage their own affairs. Both conditions      must be met. Even if the rule keeps someone from owning a      gun, that person can pursue an appeal.       America has seen what can happen when someone with severe      psychiatric issues has access to firearms. Their names and      crimes live in infamy:       In 2007, Seung Hui Cho shot to death 32 people at Virginia      Tech University before killing himself. Two years earlier, a      judge had deemed Cho an ``imminent danger'' because of mental      illness and ordered him to seek treatment. But because he was      never committed, that assessment never got recorded in the      federal database of people ineligible to buy guns. Cho passed      the background check and bought the guns he would wield at      Virginia       In 2011, Jared Loughner shot U.Gabrielle Giffords      in the head and murdered six other people in Tucson,       In 2012, James Holmes strode into a packed movie theater in      Aurora, Colo., and opened fire, killing 12 people.       And there's Lanza, who went through months of hysterical      crying, stretches of lethargy and self-imposed isolation from      his family before unleashing terror at Sandy Hook Elementary      ``I didn't understand that Adam was drifting away,''      his father, Peter Lanza, told The New Yorker in 2014.       These crimes showcase the dangers in allowing severely      troubled individuals to buy firearms. The rule the House      voted to scrap doesn't cast so wide a net that it applies to      anyone seeking psychiatric treatment. It's specific in scope,      and anchored by a common-sense premise that many House      Republicans ignored: If a person's psychiatric disorder is      disabling enough that the individual cannot work or deal with      money-managing, bright red flags are being raised about his      or her capacity for sound judgment.       To us, that's a logical, well-grounded reason why he or she      shouldn't own a gun.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1138-2.txt,326,LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,14.0,March
10703,topic-id,665,"We can also read editorials in the Louis Post-Dispatch, the Charlotte Observer, the New York Times, and more.  Now listen specifically to the pleas of gunshot victims and their family members. Listen to Patrick Korellis, of Chicago, whom I have met. He was shot in a classroom 9 years ago at Northern Illinois University by a man who had a serious mental illness. He wrote to me and he said:       I was shot in my classroom by someone who was mentally ill,      and was able to obtain guns and a lot of ammunition because      the background checks weren't strong enough. Rolling back      some of these background checks doesn't make any sense, and      will allow more people to get through the loopholes.  Now listen to Janet Delana of Wellington, She wrote to Congress:       My daughter Colby, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who      lived at home with her father and I, received monthly Social      Security disability payments for her mental illness. In 2012      she used the money from her disability check to buy a gun at      a local gun dealer. Because she was ill and suicidal, I had      contacted the gun dealer and begged him not to sell her a      gun. However, my pleas were ignored and the dealer sold her a      gun anyway because Colby passed the background check. An hour      later, she shot her father to death and tried once again to      take her own life. She is now in an institution for life, and      my husband is gone.  Janet said:       This SSA Rule is vital. I am very concerned this resolution      would preclude SSA and possibly even other agencies from      enacting any future regulations on this or related matters.  We have a public health crisis when it comes to gun violence--in Chicago and in communities across the We have a responsibility to do what we can on the Federal level to reduce the violence and protect our citizens from getting shot. Voting for this resolution of disapproval today would be a step backward. It would weaken the gun laws on the books and make it easier for severely mentally ill people to get guns. On this, the ninth anniversary of the shooting at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, it is unthinkable that we are going to try to revoke a rule that would keep guns out of the hands of those who should have no business owning them.  Let me conclude with a statement from Bloomberg business magazine, published in an edition several weeks ago:       Advocates for the mentally ill caution that mental illness      shouldn't be equated with a penchant for violence. They're      right. But America's tragic experience with mentally ill      gunmen--from shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 to Newtown,      Connecticut, in 2012--shows the folly of simply dismissing      the danger.       In recent years Republicans have prioritized instant      gratification for anyone who desires to buy a gun. Last year      the National Rifle Association spent $50 million on the      campaigns of Donald Trump and six Republican senators. NRA      leader Wayne LaPierre, who met with Trump this week, wants      payback.       The Obama rule established a process for identifying only      Social Security beneficiaries who would be prohibited from      possessing guns under existing law. It required[[Page S1140]]     that beneficiaries be notified of the prohibition, and it      provided means to appeal the determination before an      administrative law judge or a federal court.       Such provisions would safeguard individual rights. But they      offend the fundamental principle that drives the NRA, and      thus Republican, gun politics: Anyone should be able to get a      gun at any time for any reason and bring that weapon, loaded,      anywhere.  Common sense dictates that we be careful to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them. I sincerely hope that gun owners across my State and across the Nation--and I respect them and their constitutional right--will understand that reasonable limitations on the possession and ownership of firearms is in the best interest of protecting their Second Amendment rights as well.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1138-2.txt,326,1930,2017.0,14.0,March

10454,topic-id,588,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing private relief legislation on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel, a couple living with their four U.citizen children in Camarillo,  Joseph and Sharon are nationals of Egypt who fled their home country over 19 years ago after being targeted for their religious membership in the Christian Coptic Church in They became involved with this church during the 1990s, Joseph as an accountant and project coordinator helping to build community facilities and Sharon as the church's training director in human resources.  Unfortunately, Joseph and Sharon were also subjected to threats and abuse. Joseph was jailed repeatedly because of his involvement with the church. Sharon's family members were violently targeted, including her cousin who was murdered and her brother whose business was firebombed. When Sharon became pregnant with her first child, she was threatened by a member of a different religious organization for raising her child in a non-Muslim faith.  Joseph and Sharon came to the United States legally on visitor visas in November 1998. Due to their fears of persecution in Egypt based on their religious beliefs, they filed for asylum in the United States in May 1999.  However, Joseph, who has a speech impediment, had difficulty communicating why he was afraid to return to Egypt, and 1 year later their asylum application was denied. Considering that Sharon's brother, who also applied for asylum for similar reasons, was granted asylum in the United States, Joseph and Sharon appealed the denial of their asylum applications, to no avail.  While Sharon's brother, who is now a U.citizen, has filed a family-based immigrant petition on Sharon's behalf, it will be at least 4 years until she will even be eligible for a visa number due to visa backlogs.  If Sharon and Joseph are deported before then, they will not only be separated from their family but will be forced to return to a country where persecution of Coptic Christians continues.  Due to their fear of returning to Egypt, Joseph and Sharon have therefore tried to build a life for themselves here in the United States, working hard while building their beautiful family. With the protection of past private bills I filed on their behalf, Joseph was able to get his certified public accountant license and opened his own accounting firm, where Sharon works by his side.  Joseph and Sharon make sure that their four U.citizen children--Jessica, age 18, Rebecca, age 17, Rafael, age 16, and Veronica, age 11--all attend school in California and maintain good grades.  Joseph and Sharon carry strong support from friends, members of their local church, and other Californians who attest to their good character and community contributions.  I am concerned that the entire family would face serious and unwarranted hardships if Joseph and Sharon were forced to return to For Jessica, Rebecca, Rafael, and Veronica, the only home they know is in the United Separation of this family would be devastating and the alternative--relocating the family to Egypt--could be dire, as it is quite possible that these four American children would face discrimination or worse on account of their religion, as was the experience of many of their family members.  Joseph and Sharon have made a compelling plea to remain in the United These parents emphasize their commitment to supporting their children and creating a healthy and productive place for them to grow up in I believe this family deserves that opportunity.

I believe they merit Congress's special consideration for this extraordinary form of relief.  When Jose came to the United States from Mexico, he began working as a busboy in restaurants in San Francisco, In 1990, he started working as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award-winning Italian restaurant in San  Jose worked his way through the ranks, eventuall becoming Palio's sous chef. His colleagues describe him as a reliable and cool-headed coworker and as ``an exemplary employee'' who not only is ``good at his job but is also a great boss to his subordinates.''  He and his wife Micaela call San Francisco home. Micaela is a homemaker and part-time housekeeper. They have three daughters, two of whom are U.citizens. Their oldest daughter, Adilene, age 28, is undocumented. She currently works fulltime at a cinema and hopes to continue pursuing her studies in the future.  The Martinez's second daughter, Jazmin, age 24, is a U.citizen. She graduated from Leadership High School and is now studying at California State University, San Jazmin has been diagnosed with asthma, which requires constant treatment. According to her doctor, if Jazmin were to return to Mexico with her family, the high altitude and air pollution in Mexico City could be fatal to her. The Martinez's other U.citizen daughter, Karla, is 19 years old and attends San Francisco City  The Martinez family attempted to legalize their status through several channels.  In 2001, Jose's sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Jose to get a green card. However, the current green card backlog for siblings from Mexico is very long, and it will be many years before Jose will be eligible to legalize his status though his sister.  In 2002, the Martinez family applied for political asylum. Their application was denied. An immigration judge denied their subsequent application for cancellation of removal.  Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio D'Asti, petitioned for an employment-based green card for Jose based upon his unique skills as a chef. Jose's petition was approved by U.Citizenship and Immigration However, before he will be eligible for a green card, he must apply for a hardship waiver, which cannot be guaranteed.  The Martinez family has become an integral part of their community in They are active in their faith community. They volunteer with community-based organizations and are, in turn, supported by their community. When I first introduced this bill, I received dozens of letters of support from their fellow parishioners, teachers, and members of their community.  The Martinez family truly exemplifies the American dream. Jose worked his way through the restaurant industry to become a chef and an indispensable employee at a renowned restaurant. With great dedication, Micaela has worked hard to raise three daughters who are advancing their education and look forward to continuing the pursuit of their goals.

10456,topic-id,783,"Mr.President, today I offer private immigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael The Arreolas are Mexican nationals living in the Fresno area of  Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived in the United States for over 20 years. Two of their five children--Nayely, age 30, and Cindy, age 28--also stand to benefit from this legislation. The other three Arreola children--Robert, age 25, Daniel, age 22, and Saray, age 20--are U.citizens. The story of the Arreola family is compelling, and I believe they merit Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it compelled an immigration judge to write to the Executive Office of Immigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in his clients' immigration cases.  Esidronio came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural migrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a migrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers, SWA, Program, had he known about it.  Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became pregnant with her daughter She returned to Mexico to give birth because she wanted to avoid any immigration issues.  Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United States, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of deportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United States legally. However, the poor legal representation they received foreclosed this opportunity.  One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this private bill is the devastating impact the deportation of Esidronio and Maria Elena would have on their children--three of whom are American citizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since they were toddlers. America is the only country the Arreola children have ever known.  Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high school and the first to graduate college. She recently received her Masters in Business Administration from Fresno Pacific University, a regionally ranked university, and now works in the admissions office. Nayely is married and has a young son named Elijah Ace  At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals of citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her full potential both through her academic endeavors and community service. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific University states in a letter of support, ``[T]he leaders of Fresno Pacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become exemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''  In high school, Nayely was a member of the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) college preparatory program in which students commit to determining their own futures through attaining a college degree. Nayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service organization. Perhaps the greatest hardship to Nayely's U.citizen husband and child, if she were forced to return to Mexico, would be her lost opportunity to realize her dreams and contribute further to her community and to this country.  Nayely's sister, Cindy, is also married and has a 7-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son. Neither Nayely nor Cindy is eligible to automatically adjust their status based on their marriages because of their initial unlawful entry.  The Arreolas also have other family who are U.citizens or lawful permanent residents of this country. Maria Elena has three brothers who are American citizens, and Esidronio has a sister who is an American citizen. They have no immediate family in  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their taxes every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked hard to support themselves.[[Page S1645]]  As I mentioned, Esidronio was previously employed as a farm worker but now has his own business in California repairing electronics. His business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home for his family. He and his wife are active in their church community and in their children's education.

The Mkoian family is originally from They decided to leave Armenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several incidents in which the family experienced harassment, vandalism and threats to their well-being.  In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing. At one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which he refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later learned that a coworker had registered the vehicles at the request of the same chief.  After Ruben reported the bribe offer to illegally register vehicles and said he would call the police, his family store was vandalized and he received threatening phone calls telling him to keep quiet. A bottle of gasoline was thrown into his family's residence, burning it to the ground. In April 1992, several men entered the family store and assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.  Ruben, Asmik, and their son Arthur, who was 3 years old at the time, left Armenia and entered the United States on visitor visas. They applied for political asylum that same year on the grounds that they would be subject to physical attacks if returned to It took 16 years for their case to be finalized, with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denying their asylum case in January 2008.  At this time, Ruben, Asmik, and Arthur have exhausted every option to obtain immigration relief in the United While Ruben and Asmik's other son, Arsen, is a U.citizen, he is too young to file a green card petition on their behalf.

10673,topic-id,855,"Mr.Speaker, for 150 years now, Nebraska has held a special place in the history of We Nebraskans rightly pride ourselves on the values of hard work, on the values of community life, on the proper value of the good stewardship of our precious resources. The mystique of the Great Plains, the nobility of the family farm, and the vibrancy of our people create the conditions for the good life.  Our story is one of strength, it is one of dignity, and I am proud to celebrate our 150th anniversary.                              {time}  2030  Mr.Speaker, a number of years ago, a gift of land donation enabled the expansion of the Homestead National Monument, which is near Beatrice, Run by the National Park Service, their personnel were kind enough to invite me to the dedication ceremony; and during that event, a young woman who was from a seventh-generation farm family--in high school at that time, as I recall--got up to speak. She gave a beautiful talk about our Nebraska values, our connectedness to the land, the deeper meaning of living on the plains, and the ideal of maintaining the continuity of family life.  Her remarks, Mr.Speaker, moved me so much that I literally tossed my own speech aside and spoke off the cuff, and I said something like this: Perhaps it was on a day just like this where that settler family came over the hill there, and they looked at the great expansion of the plains before them.  Perhaps that day they felt the warm, spring sun on their cheeks, and they heard the chirp of the western meadowlark in the air, and they watched as the beautiful bluestem prairie grass swayed in the wind. Perhaps it was then that they made their decision: We stay right here. Nebraska will be our home.  Mr.Speaker, when I finished that, I was very proud of myself, so I sat down. And then the next speaker came up, another political figure, and he had this to say: Well, my family came here because they were horse thieves. We all shared a little laugh, but really, Mr.Speaker, Nebraska's colorful history and droll wit were simultaneously captured in that moment.  Nebraska's official motto is ``Equality before the law,'' but our unofficial motto is ``Nebraska nice.'' It is true. Nebraskans are generally nice. But beneath that friendly veneer is an unmistakable, unvarnished realism.  Nebraskans have a unique ability to look at a situation and size it up accurately, if often humorously. ``Git r done'' is an often-used phrase that I think can be safely attributable to us.  Now, sometimes, Mr.Speaker, Nebraska has been pejoratively described in the popular imagination of our country, first as the ``Great American Desert'' because it was thought that nothing would grow there. Today, we have the largest amount of acreage under irrigation in the country, including the fact that we are the largest grower of popcorn in We are a leader in livestock production and multiple types of commodity production, as well as specialty crops.  We were sometimes castigated as ``flyover country.'' I hear that around here sometimes, that is, until you come to Nebraska and realize that it is a wonderful place to live and to work and to raise a family relatively free from crime, except even horse thieves, congestion, as well as pollution.  Nebraska has, routinely, the highest graduation rate in the country and the lowest unemployment rate in the country.  And, though, in true Nebraska fashion, self-effacing Cornhuskers would cringe at the term, we have had our fair share of celebrities as well, including Father Ed Flanagan, who founded Boys Town, now known as Boys Town and Girls Town; Civil Rights pioneers, Chief Standing Bear being one of the most prominent; Malcolm X; authors Mari Sandoz and Willa Cather; professional athletes Bob Gibson and Gale Sayers; and entertainers, Henry Fonda, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Johnny Carson, and Dick  Moreover, Mr.Speaker, our singular, unicameral legislature is a model for bipartisanship and frugality. And I would be remiss if I didn't say our run-it-up-the-gut offense with a few option twists, it may not have been flashy, but it helped the University of Nebraska's football team win five national championships.  I am proud to serve in the United States congressional seat once held by Williams Jennings Bryan, who along with Senator George Norris perhaps are the most famous, though controversial in some ways, politicians in our State's history.  As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Nebraska's admission to the United States of America--by the way, the first State admitted after the Civil War--I recall Representative Bryan's words from over 100 years ago. It is a quote that actually is outside of our football stadium, known as Memorial Stadium, on Tom and Nancy Osborne It says this: ``Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.''  And perhaps, Mr.Speaker, we can add to that quote today: And that the choice to be good makes the destiny arrive well.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak to the danger that is currently posed by the Islamic Republic of  Iran and its fundamentalist government pose the gravest threat to global peace, stability in the Middle East, and Israel's existence.  Iran continues to extend its dangerous hegemony through the region in places such as Lebanon, by arming and training Hezbollah; in Gaza, by arming Hamas; in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.[[Page H967]]  Iran's taking hostage of U.sailors and its continued ballistic missile tests and death threats to Israel highlights Iran's evil intentions and the need for the United States to play a leading role in rolling back Iran's growing influence and its push to destabilize the Middle East and the world. These issues have been exacerbated by the irresponsible and catastrophic nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1.  It is obvious to anyone that the $150 billion given to Iran will be used to fund more terror and further Iran's destructive ambitions. In addition, the nuclear deal legitimizes Iran's ability to enrich uranium and functionally ensures Iran's path to a nuclear weapon within 10 years. The deal is structured to mask Iran's inevitable noncompliance.  As a member of the Florida Legislature, I had supported Florida's Iran divestment. As a Member of Congress, I very much look forward to reauthorizing the Iran Sanctions  I am extremely proud of President Trump and his administration for enacting appropriate sanctions against Iranian officials who have been engaged in the most recent destructive and destabilizing nuclear tests.

Iran only understands strength. For the last 8 years, they have seen from this country far too much weakness and far too much willingness to accept their destructive role in the world.  Mr.Speaker, the way Iran operates is through a series of franchises for terror. Whether that is Hamas or Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, we see time and time again Iran acting as a neo-Persian, neo-Ottoman That cannot be tolerated in a peaceful world. It cannot be tolerated in the most dangerous neighborhood on It underscores the purpose of Americans speaking with resolve and with strength in condemning the most recent ballistic missile tests and in standing with our greatest ally,  It was shameful that, in the waning hours of the Obama administration, President Obama was willing to allow the United Nations to take action against Israel while continuing its furtherance of appeasement toward some of the most dangerous countries on the planet Earth who do not share our values or our interests.  So I am glad to see an American reset, a resurgent America again speaking to the great values that have functioned as a beacon of hope for the world for generations. That is what we must return to, and that is what President Trump is doing today. I applaud his administration. I applaud his Secretary of the Treasury for stepping forward and advancing these needed sanctions.  I am hopeful that this Congress will continue to take action to show support for President Trump in this endeavor, but we must also recognize that this is but a first step. So much damage has been done to the cause of peace for the last 8 years under President Obama, and we have much work to do in this Congress, whether it is rebuilding and restoring our military so that we can be a force for peace, whether it is making sure that our allies know that we will stand with them, or whether it is making sure that our adversaries know that we are very serious and there will be serious consequences for their bad behavior.

This is a great time for revival and renewal in this country, and as Americans do more to rebuild the country internally and grow our economy and achieve more prosperity with lower and fairer taxes, with a regulatory climate that is more acceptable for a prosperous country, we also have to keep an eye on the world and our position on the global stage.

10447,topic-id,1154,"Mr.Speaker, I am going to cut directly to the chase. The Trump-Ryan healthcare bill betrays every single promise Donald Trump made about health care, and does it all for the sake of an enormous tax cut for those who need it least.  The first promise that Donald Trump made to the American people was that everyone would have health insurance. Although the ACA expanded health coverage to more than 20 million Americans, Donald Trump said repeatedly that he didn't think the ACA provided enough people with coverage. He said: ``We're going to have insurance for everybody,'' and ``I'm not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford health insurance.''  What does the Trump-Ryan bill do?  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 14 million people would immediately lose coverage next year, and 24 million people would lose coverage by 2027. That is outrageous. But it gets worse.  According to the White House's own estimate, 26 million people, not 24 million people, will lose coverage under the Trump-Ryan bill.  The second promise that Donald Trump made to the American people was that their health insurance would be cheaper. Donald Trump said that his plans would have ``much lower deductibles.''  Secretary Tom Price said last week that under the Trump-Ryan proposal ``nobody will be worse off financially.''  What does the Trump-Ryan bill actually do?  In my home State, Arizonans will get hit hard, very hard. In 2020, under the Trump-Ryan plan, Arizonans will receive on average $3,500 less in subsidies than ObamaCare, meaning they are going to be forced to spend more money out of pocket to continue getting care.  The Trump-Ryan bill will stick it to older It peels back an ObamaCare rule that protects older people from higher costs. The Trump-Ryan bill green-lights insurance companies to charge older Americans 66 percent more.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, a typical, low-income, 64-year-old's out-of-pocket costs would increase from less than $2,000 a year to almost $15,000 a year by 2026. So if you are an older American and you don't like ObamaCare, let me tell you this right now: You are going to hate  The third promise that Donald Trump made to the American people was that Americans would enjoy better health care. As a candidate, Donald Trump said that ObamaCare was ``horrible health care.'' He promised that ``everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.''  So what does the Trump-Ryan bill do?  Well, if you are lucky enough to still have health insurance under the Trump-Ryan plan, it will provide you even worse coverage. The bill does nothing to increase the quality of your care. It will cut some of the healthcare services you receive now.  In his speech before Congress less than 3 weeks ago, Donald Trump said that ``we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.''  At a time when opiate overdoses kill more Americans than car accidents, we absolutely should be expanding treatment. But what does the Trump-Ryan bill do?  It does the opposite by cutting addiction services and mental health treatment under  Donald Trump's fourth promise to the American was that he would not cut During the Republican presidential primary, he bragged that he was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state that there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and  What does the Trump-Ryan bill do?  It cuts Medicaid more than it has ever been cut before. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, it cuts Medicaid funding by $370 billion over 10 years.  The Trump-Ryan bill will permanently and radically weaken this critical safety net for the working poor. It freezes enrollment in Medicaid and unravels the Medicaid expansion. If you are worried about what this means for you, your family, and your friends, you should be.  Donald Trump is breaking his promise on Will he break his promise on Medicare, too? Will he break his promise on Social Security? Why is Donald Trump breaking promise after promise he made on health care?  The Trump-Ryan bill takes healthcare coverage away from millions of people, it raises deductibles and copays, and provides worse coverage for those who are lucky enough to still be able to afford it.  So what are Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and House Republicans up to? This bill does a lot of things poorly, but there is one thing, and really only one thing, that this bill does incredibly well. It cuts a whole lot of taxes for the rich.  This Trump-Ryan ``healthcare bill'' includes a whopping $600 billion in tax cuts, almost all for the wealthy. The single biggest tax cut in the bill repeals a 3.8 percent tax on investors who make more than $250,000.  This tax cut will not put a single dollar back in the pocket of any family who makes less than $250,000. But if you are the top one-tenth of 1 percent, which means that you make at least $3.75 million per year, then you will get on average a $165,000 tax cut. This is outrageous.  The Trump-Ryan bill also repeals a nearly 1 percent tax on families making over $250,000. Again, if you are in the top one-tenth of 1 percent, you are going to do great under the Trump-Ryan bill. You will get an average tax cut of over $30,000.  But, if you are in the bottom 90 percent, if you are an average, hardworking American, you will get nothing from this tax cut.  Who are Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and House Republicans looking out for? If you are an out-of-work steelworker in Youngstown, it is not you. If you are a struggling farmer in rural Alabama, it is not you. If you are working at Target, Walmart, or McDonald's, you are out of luck, too. Heck, even if you are making a decent living as an auto worker or a truck driver, it is not you.  Two nights ago, Donald Trump even admitted this. In an interview on FOX News, Tucker Carlson pointed out to Donald Trump that the rich do a lot better under the Trump-Ryan healthcare bill than working and middle class people, many of whom supported him in this election.  What did Donald Trump say in response? ``Oh, I know.''  Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and House Republicans are looking out for the richest of the rich. They are putting the pinch to you, hardworking Americans, to give their rich friends and supporters a giant tax break, and they are willing to wreck our healthcare system and take healthcare insurance away from 24 million Americans to do it.  Two years ago, Marco Rubio called out Donald Trump as a con artist. The Trump-Ryan healthcare bill is one big con on the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

10432,topic-id,2120,"Mr.Speaker, here it is, It has been a good week in We have gotten some of President Trump's nominees approved and through the Call them like you see them, I think.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has done a great job this week. I applaud his efforts. And as a result of what President Trump has been doing--and actually part of it is just his getting elected--has done for our economy because people know--at least a lot of people know--he is going to keep his word. He is already showing he is doing that, and he has repealed some of the executive orders that have been doing so much damage to our economy.  And when we say economy, what we mean is, the rank and file people, the backbone of America who have been struggling, who have made less money than they did 8 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Those are the people we are talking about; those who have been out of work, the 94 or 95 million who have become so desperate, they pulled out of even applying for work.  I enjoyed, to an extent, the exchange between my friend, Kevin McCarthy and my friend across the aisle Leader And I get amused when I hear Democrats quoting Senator McCain and Senator Graham--wonderful people. Lindsey Graham, it is a real joy to be around talking to Lindsey But if you look at positions they have taken, it would make you think twice about quoting them as positions you wanted to have supporting yours.  I mean, nothing stands taller than the 30 million of the 90 million or so living in Egypt, when they rose up that June because a Muslim brother named Morsi was seizing power. He was on his way to becoming the Chavez in North Africa, and the people rose up. It was not only the largest peaceful demonstration in the history of the world, it was the largest demonstration in the history of the world.  All over Egypt, moderate Muslims, Christians, Jews, secularists, they all rose up, went to the streets and demanded the removal of the man who would be king, the Muslim brother named The difference in this king is, as many of the Egyptians have pointed out when I have been in Cairo and other places, he wasn't just going to be king. He was going to be the puppet of the spiritual leader of Islam in  Some of my Egyptian friends, when I have been over there, say: yeah, we have seen video of him taking his orders from the spiritual imam, and he followed his leadership. So if that is true, then he wasn't just going to be king. He was going to be a king puppet.  But the Muslim brother was removed as a result of 30 million people rising up peacefully. Morsi only, allegedly, got around 13 million to claim the win and made clear his opponent knew--for the original Presidential election--that if he raised a stink about any votes being fraudulent, they would burn the country down--that was some of his supporters. Because the Muslim Brotherhood, if you go back and check, when churches are burned, it is normally the Muslim Brotherhood over there.  In Egypt, they had been anathema to representative government, to civilized government, to nonsectarian government. They want a new caliphate to start with basically the old Ottoman Empire and Erdogan in Turkey; he is undoing all of the great reforms made by the great Ataturk nearly 100 years ago, and he is undoing them.                              {time}  1145  There are those in Turkey who would like to see a caliphate--a new Ottoman Empire--and it have its leadership in They long for the days when they ruled an expansive caliphate.  I had a reporter say: Why would you say that?  I said: Go look at a map. I know you weren't ever taught what the Ottoman Empire was. Go look at a map and look at the countries where our President is supporting an uprising that eventually, if we don't stop it, will become anarchy or it will become part of the caliphate.[[Page H965]]  The new jobs report that is just out: 227,000 new jobs. And from what I'm hearing from constituents, these aren't just the part-time jobs or the minimum wage jobs that the previous President bragged about. He had to brag about it because he didn't have anything else to talk about. People lost their full-time jobs and could only acquire part-time jobs, and this administration bragged about those. If they got two part-time jobs to make up for losing their full-time job, this Administration bragged: We created two jobs.  I would submit that when you are creating two jobs by causing a person to lose all of their benefits and full-time employment, you haven't done such a good thing.  Fortunately, the people of Egypt did not listen to Senator McCain and Senator Graham when they flew to Cairo and begged for the people of Egypt to return the Muslim ``brother who would be king'' back into his royal kingship. I know they weren't intentionally supporting an evil ruler; it is just they didn't know. So, hopefully, they will become more aware that it is not a good thing to support the Muslim  With regard to Australia and the alleged news about President Trump getting into it with the leader of Australia, well, to whom is the leader of Australia accountable? To whom does the leader of Australia owe his allegiance?  It is the people of So when he calls or talks to President Trump and begs or demands Trump to take these refugees that the Prime Minister in Australia knows are a threat to the safety of the Australian people, when he wants them out of Australia, there is a reason--because his allegiance is not to the people of the United States--his allegiance is to the people of So, naturally, being allegiant to the people of Australia, he wants the dangerous refugees out of  President Obama, basically by his actions, in effect, was saying: Give us not your tired, your poor, the people yearning to be free, but give us your people that yearn to destroy America because we're going to bring them in. We're not going to vet them properly because we have got no information to properly vet them. That's how we have been able to let people in who had their fingerprints on IEDs that killed Americans, and maimed Americans because we are not properly vetting them.  Oh, yeah, we compare any information we have against what we've got. But don't forget, as Phil Haney, the whistleblower from Homeland Security, pointed out, he was personally required to delete massive pages of information about terrorist ties of people coming into the United States because they did not want those terrorist ties in the Homeland Security database. Then he also, of course, was on his computer when he saw somebody above his pay grade deleting things that he personally put in about terrorist ties. They were deleting them.  So when Janet Napolitano talks about, We get a ping and we connect the dots, she caused massive numbers of dots to be deleted. They are not there. We don't know who we are getting. When anyone comes from Syria--we know ISIS has taken governmental printing areas before. They can produce official Syrian passports not with the support of the Syrian Government, but just because they have the equipment to do it. So when we get information saying, I am from Syria, maybe they are, and maybe they're not. We don't know where they're from.  The FBI Director created one of the most incredible political stunts of any FBI Director in history last summer when he stepped up and outlined that a crime had been committed by Presidential candidate Hillary But then he goes on to say: But no reasonable prosecutor would pursue this. It is incredible the extent he went to to help Hillary  I know there were some of my Democratic friends that got mad at him when a week before the election he said that they were reopening the investigation. But if you look at the circumstances, it was information that we had FBI agents who were so upset that Comey wouldn't reopen the investigation. When they knew some of what was in the computers that they had gotten ahold of belonged to Anthony Weiner and Hillary Clinton's closest adviser and confidante, Huma Abedin Weiner, the word was we had FBI agents saying that: If you don't reopen, we're going to have a press conference, we're going to resign, and we're going to out you that you're protecting Hillary So what could he do to help Hillary Clinton but say: ``I am going to reopen the investigation?''  I commented to somebody in the media back then:       Well, of course, it may appear to help We will      know whether that was his intent or not because you can't      examine tens of thousands of emails adequately. You can do an      algorithm search, but you can't adequately investigate them      for a crime, including false statements to the FBI, within a      week. So if he comes out before the election and says that      there is nothing here, then we know why he came out and said      that we are reopening. It was to stop FBI agents from      resigning and from outing him for protecting Hillary  So what happens?  Two days before the election, he said: Yeah, we checked it all out.  He couldn't possibly have.  He said: We checked it all out, and there is nothing here to prosecute.  So that same FBI Director, though, didn't help the Obama administration. On occasion, he was calling them like he saw them; and that is:       Yeah, we will vet these people, but when they give us      information from Syria, we have no information against      which to vet that. We have to accept it for what it is      because, yeah, we're technically vetting it against what      we have, but we have nothing, so we don't know who these      people are.  So, in the meantime, the economy is turning around.  How sad is it when we have just lived through 8 years under a President's policies that were so abysmal for the good of America that the economy, when adjusted for inflation, was slower than it was in the 4 years of Jimmy Carter?  I know there are some in the media that would grab 1 month and say: See, this was a good month.  Let's look at the 8 years compared to the 4 years of President Carter, 4 of the worst years for the American economy in history since the President Obama, over 8 years, had a slower economy when adjusted for inflation. That is pretty sad.  It is also sad this week to read this article from The Daily Caller: ``Laura Wilkerson, whose teenage son was tortured and murdered by an illegal alien in 2010, got into an emotional confrontation with House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at a CNN town hall event Tuesday night.  ``Wilkerson told Pelosi, `In 2010, one of the illegals slaughtered my son. He tortured him, he beat him, he tied him up like an animal, and he set him on fire. And I am not a one-story mother. This happens every day because there are no laws enforced at the border. We have to start giving American families first.'  ``On the issue of Pelosi and Democrats' support for sanctuary cities, Wilkerson asked, `How do you reconcile in your head about allowing people to disavow the law?'  `` `There's nothing, I'm sure, that can compare to the grief that you have, and so I pray for you,' Pelosi said.''  Pelosi went on: ``But I do want to say to you that in our sanctuary cities, our people are not disobeying the law. These are law-abiding citizens. It enables them to be there without being reported to ICE in case of another crime that they might bear witness to.''  ``Pelosi then asked if her son was murdered in a sanctuary city. Josh, Wilkerson's son, was murdered just outside Houston, Texas, which is a sanctuary city.''  So I believe in the power of prayer. I think it's one of the greatest gifts God gave us. C.Lewis talked about we are here on Earth behind enemy lines, if you would.  Can you imagine being behind enemy lines and getting messages from your home headquarters and you refuse to open them and read them?  He says that we have a Those are messages from our home headquarters. We ought to be reading them.

10434,topic-id,376,"If the gentleman might take a question. I appreciate that clarity. It is clarity that has been missing for a long time.  We have people screaming that President Trump should not have put a temporary pause that was half as long as the pause President Obama put on. I understand there is so much stress and pressure when you are President; he probably just forgot he put a 6-month ban, previously, on a Muslim nation sending people in.  You made so clear the case for concern about Iran, and I am with you. I am thrilled that we have a President that is not choosing to give our lunch money, figuratively speaking, to the big bully in the schoolyard.  I don't know if my friend from Florida ever got bullied in elementary school. I did. I learned early on that it doesn't help to give bullies money. They are not going to leave you alone until you stand up to them. Maybe they whip you, but they don't want to go through what you put them through again by standing up to them, so they leave you alone.  In our case, we are strong enough to take on any bully; but instead, we paid the big bully, Iran, as you pointed out, massive amounts, billions and billions of dollars. We agreed to pay them up to $150 billion.  We have got some friends here in Congress in the House and Senate that were so upset with the President having this 90-day pause on seven countries.

The counterargument is made often to us: ``Other than the San Bernardino shootings, has there been a terrorist attack involving a non-U.S.-born attacker since 9/11?''  There was a great article in The Federalist by Kyle Shideler on January 30. He answers: Yes, but first of all, why exclude the San Bernardino killers, terrorists?

10440,topic-id,1846,"I thank the gentleman. I would also note, as this Federalist article points out, yeah, of course, when there is a terrorist attack, it also affects the economy. That is why Osama bin Laden wrote about how they had only spent a tiny amount of money to train their people from 9/11 and that it had clearly cost America trillions of dollars, that even if they couldn't bring us down any other way, if they could do other attacks like that, costing relatively low amounts to them but costing us billions and trillions, they could bring us down economically.  So it only makes sense, though, Iran wants to bring us down, so they ought to be one of the seven that the Obama administration named as a threat, and they were. But even just recently at Ohio State University, Abdul Razak Ali Artan ran over several students with a car before attacking them with a butcher knife. That was a refugee born in Somalia, one of the seven countries that the Obama administration named as a threat, and so President Trump took the Obama administration seriously and named them as one of seven, that we would have not a permanent ban but a temporary ban for 90 days. The guy ran over numerous students at Ohio State, but our friends on the other side of the aisle and their friends in the mass media, they refuse to notice what is going on.  Look at Tsarnaev, the Tsarnaev brothers in As we know, Russia notified the United States not once but twice that the older Tsarnaev had been radicalized, and he had been to a country, and the people he hung around with were radicals, and it seemed like they probably radicalized him.  So what happens? Well, they get information to our intelligence community, and, since, they have been trained for the last 8 years to only notice You can tell someone is an Islamophobe if they complain about a radical Islamist, then you know you have got an So of course if they want to stay in the intelligence community, they are not going to be looking. They are going to follow their training, look for Islamophobes instead of looking for radical I am sure they looked into it, but, based on their training, they have no basis to work with.  So what happens? Russia notified us again. As I understand, they notified the And as the FBI Director commented, look, we sent an FBI agent to interview him, and he said, basically, he wasn't a terrorist, he was a good guy. Imagine that. Somebody who wants to kill Americans might also lie. Who would have ever thought? Except American juries. I have seen it as a judge. I have seen juries find that if you will lie to them, you may do a lot worse things as well. Well, the reverse is also true. Often, if you are willing to take someone's life, you might just be willing to lie about it as well.  So the FBI didn't even stop there, taking the word. They didn't take the word of They went to his mother, and apparently his mother said: No, my son is not a terrorist. He is a good boy. He is a good boy.  There you go, full FBI investigation. Not under the old Not the way most FBI agents have ever been trained. But, of course, under the last 8[[Page H969]]years of training of the FBI, they were afraid to ask the tough questions.  The truth is, they don't know the questions to ask. They don't know that you should ask about whether there has been a tremendous increase in the amount of study of the Koran and a massive increase in the memorization of the Koran, and a change in the appearance, and knowing what to look for, and asking questions like: What do you think about Qutb, the Egyptian martyr, the Muslim brother who wrote the little book ``Milestones'' that Osama bin Laden said, along with Mr.Nasif, for whom Huma Abedin worked at one time according to the masthead of the publication, he credited Nasif and also Qutb's book ``Milestones'' to radicalizing him.  If you haven't been trained with Kim Jensen's 700 pages, which were outlawed by the FBI for a while, because he clearly explained what FBI agents should be looking for. Mr.Jensen told me that they banned his information, they struck it, and wouldn't allow anybody to be trained. Under incident information, they train people what to look for in a radical But then they brought it back, but only for some of the leaders. The rank and file for so long under this administration did not get the benefit of his 700 pages that would help train. Why? Because CAIR, the Council on American Islamic Relations, who had implications in the Holy Land Foundation trial, the biggest supporter of terrorism ever prosecuted in the United States, convictions all around in November of 2008, and they should have gone on to prosecute the named co-conspirators. The only reason they didn't is because a new administration came in.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed--the mastermind of 9/11, of the brutal killing of about 3,000 Americans and other foreigners, innocent victims--has bragged about his planning. In a guilty plea where the judge went through, as I used to, to make sure they understood their rights, he bragged about that and some terrorist attacks they didn't even know he had involvement in. He was bragging.                              {time}  1230  And he says, if we have terrorized you, then praise be to And he says such things as we deserve attack, we deserve to be killed in America, anyone who is a low-life Jew or says that God has a  So those of us who believe God had a Son, and He loved the world so much He sent His only begotten Son and whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life, anybody who believes that is worthy of death under the Koran, according to the brilliant teacher and mastermind of the 9/11 attack. And then he quotes from the Koran that anyone who tries to combine someone with Allah is worthy of death, and that means any They have explained these things.  But Khalid Sheikh Mohammed went through an expansive hearing with a judge explaining what all he was involved in and why he was guilty of 9/11 and praise be to Allah for all of the people that were killed on 9/11 at the Pentagon, at the World Trade  Why was he not sentenced? Because we had an election in 2008, and before the plea was made final, we had a new Attorney General named Eric At that point, all bets were off. They didn't follow up the plea was withdrawn, and he still hasn't been sentenced for the things he admitted to over 8 years ago.  Had they simply moved forward with the guilty plea, if we had had a President for the last 8 years that made clear ``you might as well plead guilty because nobody else is going to let you out,'' then we would have finished the guilty plea, and he would have been appropriately sentenced. But instead, this administration chose to send hope to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed he might end up being one of the people they release; because, if they close Guantanamo Bay, he either gets moved to the United States or we let him go, maybe like we have for some who went to Yemen and are back in the fight, or other people like Saudi Arabia and are back in the fight.  He had real hope once President Obama came in and Eric Holder became Attorney General, and Loretta Lynch after him, that he might get released even after he admitted to the most important role in the killing of 3,000 people on American soil on 9/11. He still has not been prosecuted. They didn't follow up on his guilty plea. The plea was withdrawn.  That man should not be allowed out of prison. He is a threat to the world, and he is a valuable tool in the hands of radical  Well, thank God, as President Obama said, elections have consequences. We have a President who didn't take an oath of office to protect all of the people of He made clear that our friends will know they are our friends, and I can see him working very closely with the Prime Minister of Australia in the future. But leaders around the world are now taking notice: Wait a minute. America has a President that is not coming to us and apologizing for America's goodness and their pursuit of freedom for as many people as they can--not apologizing.  He is making clear, if you are our friend, you are going to feel it. If you are our enemy, you are going to feel it. So I think Iran may have finally met their match. We don't have an apologist to come in and apologize for America's efforts, the blood, the treasure that has been spent on behalf of people around the world.  And now even our Australian Prime Minister understands: Look, I want to work with you--President Trump feels that way; he wants to work with them, and he will work with them--but my oath is to the United States of America and I know your oath is to I know because of your oath to help and protect the people of Australia you want to get rid of those refugees, some of whom may be dangerous.  I know President Obama said: Yeah, we will take the dangerous people that may hurt Never mind we have got Americans being hurt. We will take them.  Well, there is a different sheriff in town here in Washington, and leaders around the world need to know that starting on January 20, the United States is no longer going to take actions that are detrimental to our own well-being, to the well-being of Americans, and to the security of the United States under our So thank God, thank Trump, thank those that are seeing with clarity what is going on.

Then Mexico can be one of the top economies in all the world because of the best workers, some of the best workers in the world, and massive natural resources with which they have been blessed. They just, so far, have not had America be the kind of good neighbor that would help them stop the drug cartels.

10582,topic-id,777,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, would restore mandatory sanctions for frivolous lawsuits filed in Federal court.  Many Americans may not realize it, but today, under what is called rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is no requirement that those who file frivolous lawsuits pay for the unjustified legal costs they impose on their victims, even when those victims prove to a judge the lawsuit was without any basis in law or fact.  As a result, the current rule 11 goes largely unenforced because the victims of frivolous lawsuits have little incentive to pursue additional litigation to have the case declared frivolous when there is no guarantee of compensation at the end of the day.  H.720 would finally provide light at the end of the tunnel for the victims of frivolous lawsuits by requiring sanctions against the filers of frivolous lawsuits, sanctions which include paying back victims for the full cost of their reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result of the rule 11 violation, including attorneys' fees.  The bill also strikes the current provisions in rule 11 that allow lawyers to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims and demands by simply withdrawing them within 21 days. This change eliminates the ``free pass'' lawyers now have to file frivolous lawsuits in Federal court.  The current lack of mandatory sanctions leads to the regular filing of lawsuits that are baseless. So many frivolous pleadings currently go under the radar because the lack of mandatory sanctions for frivolous filings forces victims of frivolous lawsuits to roll over and settle the case, because doing that is less expensive than litigating the case to a victory in court.  Correspondence written by someone filing a frivolous lawsuit, which became public, concisely illustrates how the current lack of mandatory sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits leads to legal extortion. That correspondence to the victim of a frivolous lawsuit states: ``I really don't care what the law allows you to do. It's a more practical issue. Do you want to send your attorney a check every month indefinitely as I continue to pursue this?''  Under the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, those who file frivolous lawsuits would no longer be able to get off scot-free and, therefore, they couldn't get away with those sorts of extortionary threats any longer.  The victims of lawsuit abuse are not just those who are actually sued. Rather, we all suffer under a system in which innocent Americans everywhere live under the constant fear of a potentially bankrupting frivolous lawsuit.  As the former chairman of The Home Depot company has written: ``An unpredictable legal system casts a shadow over every plan and investment. It is devastating for startups. The cost of even one ill-timed abusive lawsuit can bankrupt a growing company and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.''  The prevalence of frivolous lawsuits in America is reflected in the absurd warning labels companies must place on their products to limit their exposure to frivolous claims. A 5-inch brass fishing lure with three hooks is labeled ``Harmful if swallowed.'' A household iron contains the warning ``Never iron clothes while they are being worn.'' A piece of ovenware warns, ``Ovenware will get hot when used in oven.''  And here are just a couple of examples of frivolous lawsuits brought in Federal court, where judges failed to award compensation to the victims:[[Page H2026]]  A man sued a television network for $2.5 million because he said a show it aired raised his blood pressure. When the network publicized his frivolous lawsuit, he demanded the court make them stop. Although the court found the case frivolous, not only did it not compensate the victim, it granted the man who filed the frivolous lawsuit an exemption from even paying the ordinary court filing fees.  In another case, lawyers filed a case against a parent, claiming the parent's discipline of their child violated the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment by the government, not private citizens. One of the lawyers even admitted signing the complaint without reading it.  The court found the case frivolous, but awarded the victim only about a quarter of its legal costs because rule 11 currently doesn't require that a victim's legal costs be paid in full. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act would change that.  I thank the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Lamar Smith, for introducing this simple, commonsense legislation that would do so much to prevent lawsuit abuse and restore Americans' confidence in the legal system. I urge my colleagues to support it today.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-10-pt1-PgH2025-3.txt,446,COMPETITIVE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,March

10628,topic-id,626,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill that will move us a step closer towards restoring healthy competition in the health insurance industry. Today, the health insurance industry is besieged by dwindling competition and skyrocketing premiums. Insurance providers, States, and the public have been dealing with the disastrous repercussions of ObamaCare for the past 6 years and overregulation by States for much longer.  Congress finally has the opportunity to pass legislation to reverse the downward spiral of our health insurance industry. Any such legislation must encourage a robust and competitive health insurance market in which insurance providers actively compete for customers. Healthy competition ensures premiums are accurately priced and that customers are able to find a variety of policies to meet their specific needs and demands.  H.372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017, represents a step on that journey, repealing the McCarran-Ferguson Act as it applies to the business of health insurance. There is wide support for this bill, and the Judiciary Committee has favorably reported similar legislation in the past, including legislation that was passed by the House, 406-19 during the 111th  The stated goal of the bill is to help restore competition in the healthcare market. I support this goal and firmly believe this bill must be coupled with larger changes to the existing Federal and State healthcare regulatory schemes.  As Speaker Ryan has noted, States ``should be empowered to make the right tradeoffs between consumer protections and individual choice, not regulators in Washington.''  This bill does not impact the State's ability to regulate the insurance market. Rather, this legislation levels the playing field for all healthcare industry participants. While insurers have been exempt from Federal antitrust laws for the past 70 years, healthcare providers and other participants have not.                              {time}  1445  This bill removes this exemption, ensuring that health insurers are better able to compete to provide quality coverage, thereby benefiting hospitals, doctors, and, most importantly, patients.  In addition, if separate legislation is passed to allow for the more open sale of health insurance across State lines, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act will allow uniform Federal antitrust laws to be applied across the marketplace while allowing States to maintain authority as the primary regulators of the health insurance market outside of the antitrust sphere.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act was originally passed to leave the regulation of the business of insurance with the States and to allow insurers to engage in certain procompetitive collaborative activities.  This legislation limits significant uncertainty and unnecessary litigation that would likely result from a broader McCarran-Ferguson repeal, through the use of safe harbors for such historically procompetitive collaborative activities, specifically the collection and distribution of historical loss data, the determination of loss development factors, the performance of actuarial services that do not involve restraints of trade, and the use of common forms that are not coercive.  Absent these safeguards, insurers will likely disengage from certain proconsumer collaborative activities, eliminating or impeding smaller insurers from competing and disincentivizing larger insurers from exploring new products and markets. This will lead to further market consolidation and fewer product choices, the impact of which will eventually be borne by the consumer.  These narrow safe harbors create a presumption that certain procompetitive activities can continue while maintaining regulation and oversight to the extent any activity crosses over into a restraint of trade. As a result, insurers can continue to engage in proconsumer business practices and will be encouraged to provide a diverse range of offerings at fair and reasonable prices.  I thank Mr.Gosar for introducing this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Competitive Health Insurance Reform  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

10639,topic-id,982,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Our health insurance industry is in a dire situation. Premiums and deductibles are skyrocketing, hundreds of percent in some cases. In the State of the gentleman who is the chief sponsor of this bill, the State of Arizona, there has been a more than 100 percent increase in just the last year.  In 2017, the national State average of insurers participating in Federal exchanges dropped to four, down from six the previous year. Five States will only have one insurer providing plans on their Federal exchanges this year. It is time to reverse this trend. The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act is an important step in restoring competition to the health insurance industry and will help to set the foundation for additional essential reforms that must follow.  I say to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Conyers), the ranking member of the committee and my friend, I appreciate very much working with him on this legislation, but I would also say to him that this legislation, as bipartisan as it is, cannot save the Affordable Care It is drowning. It is denying people coverage. Its costs are going up so much that somebody who likes it this year will not be able to afford it next year.  The promise that if you like your health insurance you will be able to keep it was never true, and it is still not true with The promise that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor was never true. The promise that health insurance premiums would go down under ObamaCare has been proven to be totally false. Instead, what we have done is we have denied the American people the right to choose for themselves what access to health care that they need and can afford.  We have denied the American people the freedom to decide whether or not they want to purchase a product that is mandated upon them by the Federal That is wrong. It has got to change. That is why we are taking action this week--including the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, but certainly not only the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act--to return a patient-centered healthcare system to the American people, one that reconnects them with their healthcare providers, one that will make sure that they have the maximum amount of choice and the maximum amount of access to real, affordable health insurance and quality health care in I support this bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record three letters in support of H.372.

Paul Gosar,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Gosar: The Small Business &      Entrepreneurship Council (SHE Council) and our nationwide      membership of small business owners and entrepreneurs support      the ``Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017'' (H.     372). Perhaps more than any other group, small business      owners understand the need for increased competition in the      health insurance marketplace. Indeed, it is the actions of      entrepreneurs that bring down costs, enhance innovation, and      boost quality in a competitive marketplace. H.372 is a      common sense and long-overdue step to repeal special-interest      exemptions to federal antitrust laws for health insurance      companies.       These exemptions have existed for more than 70 years, and      were initially instituted to help newly formed insurance      companies deal with data sharing. Given the dramatic changes      in the industry over these past many decades, such special-     interest treatment is no longer warranted.[[Page H2273]]       Considering the government-imposed distortions within the      health care industry as a result of the Affordable Care Act      and other regulatory restrictions, full-blown review and      reform of health care policies focused on expanding      competition, and consumer choice are needed. That includes      foundational changes, such as, in the case of H.372,      removing special-interest treatment that could reduce or      retrain competition.       In order to bring down health insurance costs and utilize      the models and technologies of our modern economy to drive      value and innovation within this sector, entrepreneurs need a      system that allows for such freedom and creativity. Your bill      is an important step in bringing down artificial barriers      that are preventing much needed innovation and competition.      Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.

It would not interfere with the states' ability to      maintain and enforce their own insurance regulations,      antitrust statues, and consumer protection laws. Because      states vary in their enforcement efforts, the impact of      repeal on health insurance companies would differ from state      to state. This is no different from the situation faced by      other businesses.       The bill is narrowly drawn to apply only to the business of      health insurance, including dental insurance, and would not      affect the business of life insurance, property or casualty      insurance, and many similar insurance areas.       Passage of H.372 would help interject more competition      into the insurance marketplace by authorizing greater federal      antitrust enforcement in instances where state regulators      fail to act. When competition is not robust, consumers are      more likely to face higher prices and less likely to and less      likely to benefit from innovation and variety in the      marketplace.

10631,topic-id,757,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte and the Judiciary Committee for their thorough work on this bill. I would also like to express my appreciation to the broad group of stakeholders who have helped to shape, improve, and support this commonsense and consumer-centric legislation.  As Congress, once again, faces the preeminent task of repairing our Nation's healthcare system, first and foremost, we must establish the proper foundation for a competitive and consumer-driven health insurance marketplace that empowers patients.  The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017 will restore the application of Federal antitrust laws to health insurance and infuse much-needed competition and transparency to the industry. Ending the special-interest exemption is the essential first step to broader healthcare reform. Popular cost-reducing reform priorities, such as selling insurance across State lines and developing diverse, consumer-driven plans, are predicated on the robust competitive markets this bill will enable.  As a healthcare provider for more than 25 years, I understand firsthand the importance of a competitive and dynamic health insurance market. Patients, doctors, and hospitals alike benefit when health insurers compete to provide a variety of quality coverage options.  It is apparent that after 70 years, McCarran-Ferguson, the broad-stroked exemption created by Congress in the 1940s, was not wise. Over decades, and expeditiously since the passage of ObamaCare in 2009, the health insurance market has devolved into one of the least transparent and most anticompetitive industries in the United These antiquated exemptions are no longer necessary for health insurance. There is no reason in law, policy, or logic for the industry to have special exemptions that are different from all other businesses in the United  The interpretation of antitrust law has narrowed dramatically over the decades. Many of the practices which insurers say they need this exemption to do, such as analyzing historical loss data, have proven to be permissible by the Federal Trade Commission and the courts over the decades since McCarran-Ferguson was passed.  This narrowing of scope has resulted in a law whose efficacy and usefulness long since expired. Yet, the shell of this zombie law lurks to scare off potential, legitimate legal challenges from States, patients, and providers. These entities do not have the tools, money, or manpower to challenge these monopolies in court or head-on in the current market. Only the Federal Government, with its resources, can enforce the laws which rebalance the playing field of interstate commerce fairly.  I would like to stress the point that this legislation does not affect any other type of insurance other than health insurance. The language of the bill was carefully and deliberately drafted to exclude other areas of insurance, such as life insurance, property and casualty insurance, and excepted benefits like disability income insurance. In short, the legislation before the House today does not repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act for life insurance, annuities, property and casualty insurance, disability income insurance, and long-term care insurance.  The broad stakeholders of healthcare professionals, insurance providers, and consumer protection groups support this narrow and important scope of the language. I am open to efforts to strengthen the narrow and deliberate scope of this legislation going forward should the need and opportunity arise.  Repeal of this specific section of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which applies only to health insurance, has strong bipartisan support. As labeled earlier, in the 111th Congress, it passed by a vote of 406-19 and passed the Republican-led House in the 112th Congress by a voice vote. Similar legislation has been introduced by multiple Democratic Members of the House, and the text of my bill has been included in the Republican Study Committee's healthcare reform bill for the last four Congresses in a row.  The passage of the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act into law is an important first step towards increasing competition in health insurance markets and will assist with setting the foundation for real, competitive, and patient-centered healthcare reform.  At the end of the day, you can tell a lot about a bill by who supports it. H.372 has the support of the healthcare professionals that actually provide care to patients, including doctors, dentists, surgeons, pharmacists, chiropractors, optometrists, and others. This key law, by liberating, liberates the insurance industry and doctors and empowers the patients. Doctors will see and insurance will see that the patient is empowered for new opportunities. Things that we can't even imagine today will exist through competition. It is the American way.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman and the members of the committee for their work on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2267-2.txt,1992,THE UNSUSTAINABLE FUTURE OF STUDENT DEBT,2017.0,21.0,March
10545,topic-id,2141,"Mr.President, I rise to deliver my first official speech on the Senate floor. I begin by saying how deeply grateful I am to the people of New Hampshire for the great trust they have bestowed upon me.  I come from a State that combines rugged individualism with a strong sense of community. It is what I often call our ``all hands on deck'' approach, where we come together, we pitch in, and we help our friends and neighbors when they need it.  Right now, we see this approach each and every day with those on the front lines of our State's devastating substance misuse crisis. Law enforcement officials, medical professionals, and citizens in every corner of our State work together to try to turn the tide of this deadly epidemic. The heroin, opioid, and fentanyl crisis is the most pressing public health and safety challenge facing New This epidemic takes a massive toll on our communities, our workforce, and our economy, and I know it is ravaging other States all across our Nation too.  This crisis does not discriminate. It affects people in every community and from all walks of life. In 2016 alone, roughly 500 people in New Hampshire lost their lives as a result of this epidemic, and the spread of synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, is increasing dramatically the number of lives lost and[[Page S1831]]is killing people faster with smaller amounts of drugs. Last year, more than 70 percent of confirmed New Hampshire drug deaths involved fentanyl. Lives are at stake, so every Member of this body must come together and put partisan politics aside to get results for our people.  The people of my State have a long tradition of sharing their stories and making their priorities known to the elected officials who represent them, and everywhere I go, I hear stories from those who have been affected by this crisis. I hear inspiring stories from those in recovery who are working to put their lives back together, and I hear tragic stories from siblings, parents, and friends who know the pain of having a loved one taken from them far too soon. All of these stories are critical in breaking down the stigma of addiction and pushing for solutions. Instead of simply writing in an obituary that a loved one died suddenly, more and more families, including the families of one of my son's high school classmates, are speaking out and telling the painful stories of addiction and loss.  Last year, at our annual Easter egg hunt that I hosted as Governor, I was approached by a woman on our statehouse lawn who was carrying a baby. After I took a picture and I admired the baby, she pulled me aside and said the little boy she was holding was not her son but her grandson and that his mother had died from an overdose 1 month earlier. She was there on the day before Easter, as we celebrated our spring ritual of renewal and hope, and shared that pain with me so we could move forward to help others in her situation.  Just this week, on Monday, I met with a man named Phil, from Laconia, who is now in recovery. Phil said that over a year and a half ago, he had lost his home and nearly everything because of his substance use disorder. Now, thanks, in part, to the fact that he was able to gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, Phil is substance-free. He has gone on to become a recovery coach, and he helped found a recovery center in Laconia, where he works to help others with the same challenges he had.  We can never thank those in recovery and the families who have lost loved ones enough for speaking out about this issue and for working tirelessly and courageously to try to prevent others from suffering as they have, but while thanking them is appropriate, it is not enough. The bravery of survivors and those in recovery needs to be marked by our constant vigilance and by urgent action.  I am grateful to the Senators who have been true leaders on this issue, especially my fellow Senator from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen, who has fought tirelessly to secure funding to combat this crisis and help the people of our The passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act was an important step, as was the 21st Century Cures Act, which included some funding to fight the opioid epidemic. The Cures Act will not provide enough funding for our State, and I will continue fighting, alongside Senator Shaheen, to ensure that the Federal Government provides New Hampshire with the resources we need.  I am pleased there has been bipartisan support for combating this crisis in the Senate, but we must continue to work together at all levels of government and with those on the front lines to battle this crisis.  During my time as a member of the National Governors Association, I worked with my fellow Governors from both parties to push for steps, including passing emergency Federal funding to support States' efforts to combat this crisis, and at the State level in New Hampshire, we proved that we could come together to implement a comprehensive, ``all hands on deck'' strategy to support those on the front lines and help save lives.  During my time as Governor, we secured $5 million in additional State funding for treatment, prevention, recovery, and housing programs. We worked together to provide law enforcement with additional resources through a program called Operation Granite We expanded drug courts throughout New Hampshire, and we worked to crack down on fentanyl. In order to prevent the overprescribing of opioids, we took steps to improve provider training and update the rules for prescribers.  Critically, Republicans and Democrats put their differences aside and came together to pass and reauthorize the New Hampshire Health Protection Program, also known as Medicaid expansion. Passing and reauthorizing this program included healthy debate and, at times, heated argument. What matters is that after those debates, we were able to take this essential step forward to continue strengthening our families, our businesses, and our economy.  Medicaid expansion is providing quality, affordable health coverage to over 50,000 Granite Staters, including coverage for behavioral, health, and substance use disorder treatment. Thousands of people have received addiction treatment after gaining coverage through the Medicaid expansion program in New What is clear and what I hear from people in recovery centers all across my State is that lives are being changed and saved as a result of Medicaid expansion.  Take, for example, Ashley, of Dover, I first met Ashley at the Farnum Center in Manchester, and I have been inspired by her story ever since. Ashley is living proof of the positive impact of Medicaid expansion.  Ashley had struggled for nearly a decade with heroin addiction, during which time she was arrested, her husband died from an overdose, and she lost the custody of her young child. Yet, as a result of her courage, perseverance, and the treatment she received for her substance use disorder under Medicaid expansion, Ashley's story is one of progress. She has been in recovery for over a year. She is employed, is working at Safe Harbor Recovery Center to help others who are struggling with addiction, and has moved to employer-sponsored insurance coverage.  It was an honor to have Ashley attend the President's joint address to Congress as my guest of honor, and I will continue to carry her story with me in these Chambers and beyond.  It is not just in New Republican Governors and some of my Republican colleagues in the Senate have made clear just how critical Medicaid expansion is to their As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has found, 2.8 million people with substance use disorders, including 220,000 with opioid disorders, have coverage under the Affordable Care That is real and essential progress, but we know we have far more work to do. I am committed to working with Members of both parties in the Senate to continue building on these efforts.  What we cannot afford to do, however, is to allow a partisan agenda to pull us backward. I am extremely concerned about the effect that legislation introduced by House Republicans last week--also known as TrumpCare--would have on our efforts to combat substance misuse. Make no mistake, this legislation would end Medicaid expansion, which experts have said is the most important tool available to fight the substance misuse crisis. This plan also cuts and caps the traditional Medicaid Program, which means States will be forced to either raise taxes or cut eligibility and services.  As a former Governor, I know full well the impact the decisions in Washington can have on our communities. Repealing Medicaid expansion and capping traditional Medicaid would severely hurt the ability of those on the front lines to save lives and combat this deadly epidemic.  Substance use disorder treatment providers have been clear that if Medicaid expansion is repealed, they will have to significantly cut back on the help they can provide to those in need. To pull the rug out from millions of people across the country who are seeking a lifeline from the throes of addiction is unconscionable. We cannot let that happen.  In addition to making the substance misuse crisis worse, TrumpCare would affect countless others across New Hampshire and America, from individuals who buy their own insurance who would see their premiums skyrocket to older Americans who would now be forced to pay an age tax, to women and families who would be hurt by the provision that defunds Planned  We know there is more work to do to improve and build on the Affordable[[Page S1832]]Care Act, but this TrumpCare bill is not the answer, and I am working with my colleagues to fight against this legislation.  Furthermore, I am working on additional legislation that would help combat this substance misuse crisis. I joined Senator Portman in introducing the STOP Act, bipartisan legislation that would help stop dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl and carfentanyl from being shipped through our borders to drug traffickers here in the United These synthetic drugs are only making this crisis more dangerous, causing a spike in deaths in New Hampshire and across the We must do everything possible to stop them from entering our country.  I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues, led by Senator Klobuchar, to introduce the SALTS Act, which would empower law enforcement to crack down on synthetic substances and better prosecute drug traffickers.  I also joined Senators Manchin, Shaheen, and several of our colleagues to reintroduce the LifeBOAT Act, which would establish a permanent funding stream to provide and expand access to substance misuse treatment.  These are essential steps we need to take now. I will also continue evaluating additional legislative steps to support treatment, prevention, recovery, and law enforcement efforts. We know the road ahead will not be easy. The scourge of addiction requires us, at times, to change the way we have always done things at a quicker pace than is sometimes comfortable but that can never be an excuse for inaction.  Every day, I am reminded of the stories like those of the grandmother I met at the annual Easter egg hunt, Phil's and Ashley's, and those of the thousands in my State who continue to feel the impacts of a crisis that is taking far too many lives. By making their voices heard, citizens in New Hampshire are breaking through the stigma of addiction and, in turn, are helping others seek the treatment and recovery they need. It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that those critical services are there for them.  We must all continue to speak up and fight for those who are voiceless and those who continue to struggle. We must reach out and work toward policies that can truly make a difference because often when we reach out, people reach back, but if we are silent or if we allow the rug to be pulled out from under those seeking help, this epidemic will only get worse. It will devastate even further our families, our communities, and our businesses.  I am going to continue to fight to make progress, and I am willing to work with anyone to help those struggling to get the treatment they need and to support all of the dedicated professionals who are on the frontlines of battling this crisis. We will have to continue to fight together, each and every one of us, every single day, to build on our efforts to combat this epidemic, and by working together, we can and we will stem and turn the tide.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner).

When Rich joined CRS in 1980, he was an analyst working on a broad array of social policy issues. Initially, he worked on issues like child nutrition, poverty, Social Security, social services for the aged, and unemployment insurance. Rich cocreated and coauthored a widely circulated CRS report on Federal social welfare spending. He was also a coauthor and contributor to several chapters in the House Ways and Means Committee print ``Children in Poverty,'' which provided a detailed look at the incidence and characteristics of child poverty in the United  Rich ultimately became heavily involved in providing research and analytical support to Congress on many health policy issues, including analyses of aggregate national health expenditures, the Medicare hospital prospective payment system, the Medicare Advantage program, and Medicare catastrophic drug costs. Additionally, he has worked on numerous issues related to He both directed a team of CRS analysts as well as contributed his own analysis to the Medicaid ``Yellow Book,'' a 1988 House Ways and Means Committee print that provided a comprehensive analysis of the Medicaid program as it existed at the time. Rich also managed the 1993 update of the ``Yellow Book.''  Rich's analyses have typically involved quantitative research methodologies, modeling techniques, and the use of complex databases. Rich has excelled at developing approaches for simulating the effects of potential changes to Federal benefits and grant allocation formulas.  In addition to the direct impact his research and analytical work has had on Federal policies, Rich has made equally important contributions within CRS in managerial roles. During his tenure at CRS, he has served as section research manager of the methodology section, the research development section, the research development and income support section, and the hea1th insurance and financing section. During his tenure as an SRM, Rich helped manage CRS work on the 1996 welfare reform law and the 2003 overhaul of Medicare in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Rich helped manage an interdisciplinary team numbering about 3 dozen CRS analysts that provided legislative support during the passage of the Affordable Care  Throughout his career, Rich has served as a role model for the highest level of CRS service to Congress, upholding the Service's standards of authoritativeness, objectivity, and confidentiality. He is known within CRS for his attention to detail, methodological strength, and creative approaches toward conducting analyses. His input is sought on a great many research efforts spanning virtually all of the major domestic social policy issue areas that Congress deals with.  Rich is renowned for his tremendous work ethic and energizing presence. Those who have worked closely with him appreciate his ability to keep his sense of humor even during the most stressful times.  In recent years, Rich has served as the deputy assistant director of CRS's domestic social policy division. In that role, he has mentored and helped develop many of the division's managers, analysts, and research assistants. He has also played a central role in reviewing written work produced by the division, helping to ensure its accuracy, completeness, and quality. Moreover, in his work as a division manager, Rich has served on numerous advisory panels that have recommended organizational practices and policies for CRS, many of which have been adopted.  Rich's policy expertise has been broadly recognized. He is regularly sought for his expertise at professional meetings and conferences. He was nominated to the National Academy of Social Insurance in 2002 and has served on the steering committee of the National Health He has also been recognized with numerous Library of Congress special achievement awards.  Rich has devoted nearly his entire distinguished professional career to supporting the work of Congress and to helping build and strengthen CRS and advance its mission.

We stand here today in the midst of Black History Month where many African Americans throughout the country are asking the question: What do we do now that the unthinkable has occurred?  As a community, as a nation, we have gone from the Presidency--distinguished and dynamic 8 years--of Barack Obama to the current situation where we have a swamp percolating at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue under the leadership of Donald  He began Black History Month by saying that he was convening folks for what he called his little Black history breakfast. Those of us who actually watched some of the coverage seemed perplexed by his reference to the great Frederick Douglass as if he was still alive. If anyone has any questions about the relevance of Black History Month, we can start by noting that perhaps it is important to make sure that the Nation's Commander in Chief understands the contributions that African Americans have made to the United States of America, going all the way back to the Boston Massacre, where one of its leaders, Crispus Attucks, was the first American killed at the onset of the American Revolution in connection with the Boston Massacre, challenging the unjust taxation policies of the British  Now, the 45th President of the United States of America asked a question over the last several months: What exactly do Black folks have to lose?  Many of us were perplexed by that question, given his history, and actually think that you have lost your mind if you come to the conclusion that the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has any interest in making a positive difference in the lives of people of color generally, African Americans specifically, perhaps because of his own history.  We know that in the early 1970s The Trump Organization, of which he was president, was sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in the housing stock that they owned, where they were denying African Americans and people of Puerto Rican ancestry access to apartments, notwithstanding their economic qualifications to be renters or co-op owners.  I would just note parenthetically that it was the Nixon Justice Department--not the Kennedy Justice Department or the Johnson Justice Department or the Carter Justice Department or the Clinton Justice Department or the Obama Justice Department--that concluded that Donald Trump and his organization was discriminating on the basis of race.  Those of us from New York understand that the current occupant of the White House was the leader of the high-tech lynch mob designed to try to get the wrongfully convicted Central Park Five sentenced to death, taking out a full-page ad in some of the local periodicals in New York calling for that. It turns out that all five individuals were wrongfully convicted and spent years in jail for a crime they did not commit. Donald Trump has never apologized for that reckless and irresponsible action.  Then, of course, for 5 years he perpetrated the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America, all designed to undermine the legitimacy of the 44th President of the United States of America, which is why here in Black History Month it is very interesting to me that some of my friends on the other side of the aisle question whether we, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, or others are being irresponsible in not giving the current President a chance.  How dare you ask that question. From the beginning of the Presidency of Barack Obama, you declared war on him. You followed a philosophy that may be familiar to those of us who are familiar with the history of the Deep South: obstruction today, obstruction tomorrow, obstruction forever.                              {time}  2015  Mr.McConnell declared that his top priority was to make Barack Obama a one-term And yet, he questions whether Americans, who are part of the growing resistance movement, have failed to give Donald Trump a chance.

My amendment would amend from the underlying bill all actions where whistleblowers allege misconduct or malfeasance in connection with the Federal A whistleblower is defined as one who reveals wrongdoing within an organization in the hope of stopping it.  Our country has long recognized the importance of affording legal protections to whistleblowers. Under the protection and umbrella of these laws, whistleblowers have helped expose corruption, government waste, fraud, unconstitutional practices, and abuses of the public trust. They have risked, in many cases, their livelihoods to do what is right for this country and defend our democracy.  It should not be our objective to create barriers that will stop people in good faith from coming forward by subjecting them or their representatives to mandatory sanctions, but that is exactly what this bill is designed to do.

10685,topic-id,509,"Mr.President, the development of a skilled workforce is essential to maintaining a robust economy and driving forward innovation throughout society. Investments in education remain more important now than ever. Today the United States is 12th in the world in the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds achieving post-high school degrees. We need to make changes that help keep students engaged in their futures while also ensuring our educational programs are adequately preparing students for the jobs of the 21st century. I firmly believe that a strong congressional commitment to strengthening career and technical education, CTE, throughout the country will help us achieve this goal.  Career and technical education programs provide students with a valuable educational experience that benefits them during high school and throughout their careers. Student participation in CTE programs is linked to greater levels of student engagement and higher graduation rates. The U.S.[[Page S1807]]Department of Education announced that the average U.high school graduation rate is 83 percent, while the graduation rate for students in CTE concentrations is higher than 90 percent. Eighty-one percent of high school dropouts say real-world learning opportunities would have kept them in school. CTE programs prepare students for fulfilling careers in a number of high-growth, skill-intensive industries including information technology; science, technology, engineering and math; human services; transportation; and architecture and construction, among others. Through a combination of academic enrichment and job-specific training, CTE programs are developing postsecondary and workforce-ready graduates equipped to meet the needs of employers in current and emerging industries.  The Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act is a major source of Federal support for the development of career and technical skills among secondary and postsecondary students. Last reauthorized in 2006, the Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act needs to be modernized to meet the demands of the 21st-century workforce and ensure that students have access to the highest-quality CTE programs.  This is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues, Senator Portman, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Young, the Educating Tomorrow's Workforce Act, which would amend the Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act to raise the quality of CTE programs. The bill allows States and localities to use Perkins grant funding to establish CTE-focused academies. The legislation defines what constitutes a rigorous CTE curriculum and requires Perkins grant recipients to incorporate key high-quality elements in their programs including credit-transfer opportunities; academic and technical skills assessments; training tools that align with today's industries; CTE-focused professional development for teachers, administrators, and counselors; and CTE curriculum alignment with local, regional, and State workforce demands. Additionally, the bill improves links between high school and postsecondary education to help ease attainment of an industry recognized credential, license, apprenticeship, or postsecondary certificate to obtain a job in a high-demand career field and promotes partnerships between local businesses and other community stakeholders to create pathways for students through work-based learning opportunities.  I am proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to raise quality and access to CTE programs so that students develop the skills they need to meet the needs of 21st-century employers.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1806-2.txt,2176,COMPETITIVE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2017,2017.0,14.0,March
10429,topic-id,2082,"Mr.Speaker, President Trump is a master at diverting attention, even the media's. His diversions are a perfect foil from the constitutional questions that his and his family's behavior have raised since he took the oath of office.  With hotels and property developments all over America and the world, the Trump empire is dramatically expanding its domestic business, raising vital questions as to the Trumps' profiting from public service, including from foreign entanglements that violate the  Outlined in Article II of the Constitution, the clause prohibits the President from receiving, other than his salary, any compensation, gift, or other form of profit from the United States, a State government, or their instrumentalities.  Congress reserves its ability to consent to foreign emoluments but not to domestic emoluments. Our Founding Fathers were clear--no exceptions.  It has been heavily reported in the papers that the Trump sons have now signed at least 17 new letters of intent with potential developers, even listing specific cities. They don't have to tell their father about all this. The newspapers cover it in abundance. And the American people should never have to wonder whose interests the President serves.  Today those doubts abound. America, the scales of justice need tending.                [From The Washington Post, 4, 2017]  Trump Sons, Planning Expansion of Family Business, Look to Leverage                           Campaign Experience      (By Jonathan O'Connell, David Fahrenthold and Matea Gold)       New York.--Donald Trump's adult sons, who are overseeing a      nationwide expansion of the family business during their      father's presidency, are envisioning ways that their      experiences from the campaign trail can help them establish a      footing in dozens of new markets.       The idea is to move beyond a focus on luxury hotels in big      metropolises and build boutique properties in a broader mix      of cities, including some the Trump brothers came to know      well during more than a year of intensive travel, fundraising      and grass-roots networking on the road to The White       ``I got to see a lot of those markets on the campaign,''      Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, told The      Washington Post in a recent interview from his office on the      25th floor of Trump ``I think I've probably been in      all of them over the last 18 months.''       The initial plan is tied to the Trumps' previously      announced new chain, Scion, which is being designed as a      less-corporate feeling brand of high-end hotels with a more      affordable per-room price point than the Trumps' five-star      properties.       As with many existing Trump-branded property deals, the      developers would own the hotels while the Trumps would be      paid licensing and management fees.       The company says it has signed at least 17 letters of      intent with potential developers. It is targeting an array of      cities such as Austin, Dallas, Louis, Nashville and      Seattle--and Trump said the campaign proved useful in      forging relationships with potential new connections.       ``I met people along the way that would be awesome      partners,'' he said.       The expansion plan illustrates how President Trump's      political rise has the potential to affect his business even      as he and his sons promise to adhere to a strict ethical      boundary between the company's moves and the Trump      administration. And it shows the inherent challenge in      separating the family's political work from its corporate      interests, with upsides and potential problems.       Extending the Trump business into a greater cluster of      American cities could bring political benefits for a      president who has vowed to bring jobs and economic prosperity      to struggling communities. But it also comes as Trump has      faced criticism from Democrats and ethics officials for his      decision to retain his ownership stake in the company, a      decision that means he stands to personally benefit from its      growth.       Building new hotels, for example, could create issues--tax      disputes, allegations of labor violations or environmental      violations--that require federal departments to consider      cases that could directly impact the president's finances.      And while the Trumps have vowed to sign no new foreign deals,      pursuing a raft of new domestic contracts from coast to coast      means the Trumps are likely to engage in negotiations with      private developers, banks and investors who see additional      benefits in doing business with the president's company.       ``It's just going to add fuel to the fire that is already      burning . . . with him having still a foot in both the      boardroom and one in the Oval Office,'' said Scott Amey, the      general counsel of the nonpartisan watchdog group Project on      Government       The White House did not respond to a request for comment.      The president in January added a team of ethics lawyers to      the White[[Page H1576]]     House Counsel's Office, while the company hired a longtime      Republican attorney tasked with ensuring the Trump      Organization minimizes conflicts of interest.       In interviews, the Trump sons waved off the idea that their      plans created any potential ethical problems.       ``There are lines that we would never cross, and that's      mixing business with anything government,'' Eric Trump said.       Donald Trump said that since the inauguration, he has      spoken with his father twice on the phone and once in      person--when he and his brother attended the announcement of      their father's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Eric      Trump said he may ask his father how things are in the White      House but would never discuss government or business affairs.       ``Will we ever talk about tax policy? Will I ever ask for      anything that could otherwise benefit the business?      Absolutely, emphatically not,'' Eric Trump said. ``He has no      need to know what we're doing, and I certainly don't need to      know what they're doing, and I don't want to.''       The Trumps' point man on the expansion is Eric Danziger, an      experienced executive who was hired in 2015 after previously      overseeing expansions at Carlson Hotels Worldwide, Starwood      Hotels and the former Wyndham       One of the first Scion projects is slated to open in      Dallas, where a Turkish-born developer aims to open a sleek      glass six-story hotel as part of a $50 million mixed-use      downtown development. The Austin, Cincinnati, Denver,      Detroit, Nashville, Seattle and Louis areas are also      possible targets, according to reports by Bloomberg News and      business trade publications.       The Trumps declined to say what other cities they were      exploring for projects but said they were actively seeking      contracts in many places. Danziger, speaking last month to      Skift, an industry publication, called Scion a ``four-star      lifestyle brand'' with wide geographic appeal.       ``That kind of brand can be in every city--tertiary,      secondary,'' he said. ``So, how many is that? The opportunity      is for hundreds.''       Because of the prohibition on foreign deals, Danziger said      the company is ``going to have full focus--instead of some      focus--on growth domestically of both Trump and Scion.''       The expansion will not be easy, according to analysts. The      Trumps will be entering a crowded marketplace of new hotel      lines from Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt designed to appeal to a      broad cross-section of customers, said Michael Bellisario,      a senior research analyst with the firm Robert Baird &       ``There are so many more competitors out there today,''      Bellisario said.       For the Trumps to distinguish their projects from their      competitors, they will need to be choosy about locations,      Bellisario said. ``You've got to be on the right street comer      in the right market. You can't open these hotels in Topeka,      Kansas,'' he said. ``So when you think about that, how big      can the new line get?''       The plan is a big test for the younger       Just as Donald Trump stepped out from his father's shadow      in the 1970s to build the family real estate business into      today's worldwide collection of golf courses, hotels, condo      towers, branded merchandise and other commercial holdings,      now Donald Trump Jr., 39, and Eric Trump, 33, have a      chance to make their mark.       Along with their sister, Ivanka, who departed the company      when their father entered office, the brothers have long      served as executive vice presidents.       Before their father ran for president, the three siblings      helped expand the firm from focusing on New York to including      the management of luxury hotels in top U.cities and seven      countries, plus more than a dozen golf courses.       The fruits of that work are still coming, as last month the      company opened a new golf club in Dubai and, last week held a      grand opening for a new hotel-condominium tower in Vancouver,      B.      A major transition for the sons is taking over a company in      which the force behind every Trump company offering--whether      it was selling hotel rooms, office buildings, golf outings,      ties or raw steaks--was Donald Trump himself.       In interviews, Trump and Eric Trump said they consider      themselves protectors of the Trump brand, an effort they said      is sometimes misunderstood. Critics viewed the announcement      of Scion during the campaign as a move away from the Trump      name. The family's intent was the opposite; since they view      the name Trump has a standard for luxury that ought to be      insulated, they will use other brands for less pricey      products.       ``We would never want to dilute the real estate brand by      going into tertiary markets that can't sustain the [luxury]      properties as we build them,'' Eric Trump said, ``A lot of      hotel companies have gotten this wrong.''       Both sons worked for their father starting at young ages,      doing landscaping and other labor on his projects.       A University of Pennsylvania graduate, Trump Jr.'s first      assignment at the company was to work with executives at New      York City real estate projects.       Eric Trump joined after graduating from Georgetown in 2006.      He has overseen the Trump Winery near Charlottesville and      worked on the Trump hotel in Las Vegas, where he developed a      reputation as a hands-on executive.       ``If there's a property tax issue or any litigation, he      flies into Las Vegas and takes care of it,'' said Phil      Ruffin, a casino mogul who is the Trumps' partner in the Las      Vegas project. ``He hires the lawyer. If there are any      capital improvements, he approves them. He is very energetic      like his father--he will just work night and day.''       With their father in charge, there was an informal division      of labor among his three eldest children, governing which      projects each swooped in to help.       Ivanka Trump created her own brands of shoes, jewelry,      handbags and coats. She took the lead on some of the Trump      Organization's mast prominent recent projects, such as the      $212 million D.hotel, which had its soft opening in            ``I'm probably the most obviously like [Trump Sr.],''      Ivanka Trump said in a 2011 company video titled ``Trump: The      Next Generation.''       ``In certain ways,'' she added, ``Eric is very similar to      him in terms of his love of construction and building. And      Don has his sense of humor.''       The Trumps' planned corporate expansion comes as the      president has faced intense criticism from Democrats and      ethics experts for his continued ownership interest.       A liberal watchdog organization, Citizens for      Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), has sued      Trump, arguing that his hotel operations violate a      constitutional provision barring the president from accepting      gifts or payments from a foreign government. Some Democrats      have argued that Trump's international trademarks, including      one long-sought registration granted in February by China,      also violate the Constitution's emoluments clause.       Trump has called the CREW lawsuit ``totally without      merit.''       Amey, of the Project on Government Oversight, said there      were ways for the Trumps to avoid potential domestic      conflicts related to the hotel expansion. He said they could      put the hotel business under another corporate structure,      which does not involve a trust directly owned by the      president himself.       ``There are solutions to solving this, [hut] there doesn't      seem to be a will and a desire to do that within the White      House,'' Amey said.       The Trump brothers say they are taking ethics concerns      seriously and are doing everything necessary to avoid      distracting from their father's work as president.       ``Have I used him as a sounding board in the past? One      hundred percent,'' Trump said. ``Have I learned a lot      from him? Couldn't have had a better mentor. But he's got      real stuff he's got to deal with. These are real people's      lives . . . . So this notion that he is still running the      business from the White House is just insane.''       Trump scoffed at the idea that his father might have      somehow viewed running for president--spending millions of      dollars of his own money to run against more than a dozen      Republican challengers and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton      when few pundits gave him a chance to win--as a moneymaking      endeavor.       ``That's not a get-rich-quick scheme,'' he said. ``That      doesn't make any sense whatsoever.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1575-3.txt,616,COMPETITIVE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2017,2017.0,7.0,March

The President, Donald Trump, posed the question to African Americans asking: What do you have to lose?  Our Black history is outlined with the great progress and hard sacrifices endured by our forefathers. Under this administration and under these current circumstances that we are dealing with, yes, Mr.President, we have a lot to lose. We have a lot to lose for every point of progress that we have made in this country. And for every hard fought step forward, we have a lot to lose.  Instead of draining the swamp, this administration is filling it with unqualified and dangerous megadonors. Our basic rights and privileges included in our Constitution are under the risk of being attacked under this administration. Old battles that we fought and celebrate the wins, such as equal rights and quality education and criminal justice, have now begun again anew.  How are they under attack, you would ask? Well, let's go appointment by appointment.  Under DeVos' leadership, our education system is under attack.  African Americans have historically fought for equal access and opportunity in education.  African Americans had to suffer through the Jim Crow era to fight a segregated education system. They were forced to learn under a system that was both separate and unequal.  African Americans have faced and fought against injustice in the education system ever since our emancipation.  And now, in 2017, our Secretary of Education is Betsy And frankly, she is not qualified to be the Secretary of Education because she has zero experience in public education, and she is not the right person to lead our public schools. Being a millionaire does not mean you are qualified to direct good policy.  We have real issues in Under DeVos' direct involvement in Michigan public schools, we now have a challenge in our city of Detroit with school deserts. Some of you may not have heard about that. But a school desert is where a community does not have a local public school to attend. This means a family's only opportunity to educate their children would be to go to a for-profit charter school that is miles away, and there is no public transportation given for your child to get there, so you are in a school desert.  Our Secretary of Education should be enforcing civil rights equality and making sure that every child is educated in America, and this includes children of color who can't advocate for themselves.  Funneling taxpayer dollars to private religious schools is a step backwards. Resegregation masked under the guise of school of choice is a step backwards.  So let's talk about Secretary  Our criminal justice system is under attack.  Civil rights icons that we know and celebrate during Black History Month, like Martin Luther King and our amazing Congressman John Lewis, endured pain and suffering during a peaceful protest and support of voting rights in 1965.  Disproportionate injustices against African Americans and minorities did not end with the civil rights movement.  Today, we fight for equality under the law. This fight continues.  Now, we have Senator Jeff Sessions charged with leading the Justice His record speaks for itself. He was denied for a position as a Federal court judge speaks volumes.  Clearly, there seems to be a certain amount of fear of the truth when it comes from the mouth of Coretta Scott  We cannot go backwards. African Americans have worked hard to be a part of the fabric of this country through education, and health care is one of them.  Let's talk about Charles Drew, who, with his research, developed a technique to have blood banks that we can use in transfusions; Daniel Williams, the first person to successfully complete open-heart surgery; and Patricia Bath, whose invention in cataract lenses transformed eye surgery, and she was the first African-American woman doctor to receive a patent for a medical invention.  Now, our society's most vulnerable stand to lose something that we fought so hard for, and that is ensuring everyone receives health care in America, Women should not be charged more for insurance than a man. The sick shouldn't be denied insurance because of preexisting conditions. And Republicans instead want to repeal, take away, the ACA without any plan to replace it. We are going backwards.  This month, we celebrate how far we have come. We celebrate the progress of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights We celebrate the heros and sheros who paved the way. We have come too far to go back now.  That is why I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, along with others who have fought for Americans' equality and for the millions of Americans we represent. It is time for us to remember the great progress we have made as a nation. It is time to remember the past injustices so that we never repeat them. The sacrifices of those who came before us must never be forgotten. Their sacrifices must not be in vain.  During this month of remembrance, let us all remember we are not going back.

10452,topic-id,771,"Mr.President, today, I have reintroduced legislation to protect Americans from being stripped of their legal rights by little known clauses that are now hidden in an alarming number of contracts. When we enter into agreements to obtain cell phone service, rent an apartment, or accept a new job, most are not made aware of the forced arbitration clauses that are tucked away in the legal fine print. But these dangerous provision force us to abandon our constitutional right to protect ourselves in court and instead send hard-working Americans to face wealthy corporations behind closed doors in private arbitration. This must change.  When Congress passed the Federal Arbitration Act in 1925, it was intended to help businesses resolve legal disputes with each other. But over the past two decades, private arbitration has been abused by large companies to push Americans out of court. In doing so, these companies have effectively opted out of critical labor, consumer, and civil rights laws that give Americans the ability to assert their claims before our independent judiciary.  Forced arbitration clauses now appear in nearly every contract we sign. Unfortunately, examples of the injustice caused by these clauses are equally ubiquitous and can be found all across the country. They affect consumers, workers, seniors, veterans, and families in Vermont and every other State, and the cases are heart-wrenching.  Just last week, the Washington Post reported that hundreds of current and former employees of Sterling Jewelers--a company that earns $6 billion in annual revenue--have for years alleged that the company is engaged in pervasive gender discrimination and has fostered a culture that condones sexual harassment. The stories now being reported are shocking and date back to the early 1990s. Yet, despite the fact that women at the company have been alleging misconduct for decades, no one knew about it. That is because their claims were hidden behind closed doors because of private arbitration. To this day, we still do not know the full details.  The press has helped to bring attention to other instances of forced arbitration in recent years. In 2015, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Wells Fargo used arbitration clauses to deny customers whose names were used to open fraudulent accounts an opportunity to seek justice in court. In fact, Wells Fargo asked a Federal court in Utah to move a number of sham account allegations to arbitration. The New York Times dedicated a three-part investigative series to highlighting the impact on consumers and workers of forced arbitration clauses. And becoming the story herself, television journalist Gretchen Carlson was barred from speaking publicly about her allegations of sexual harassment against former FOX News chairman Roger  I have long raised concerns about the practice of forced arbitration, and as chairman led hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2013. This should not be a partisan issue. Both Republican and Democratic attorneys general have repeatedly spoken out against the Federal Arbitration Act's intrusion on State sovereignty and a State's compelling interest in protecting the health and welfare of its citizens. In Vermont, lawmakers enacted commonsense legislation to limit the abuse of forced arbitration clauses and raise consumer awareness, but but this law was invalidated because it conflicted with Federal law. Companies have effectively created a ``get out of jail free'' card that guts our laws and shields bad actors from any type of public accountability. This is an unconscionable situation, and Congress must act.  The Restoring Statutory Rights Act that I am reintroducing today/will protect Americans' right to seek justice in our courts. It will ensure that our Federal laws will actually be effective by ensuring that Americans cannot be stripped of their ability to enforce their rights before our independent court system. This bill also ensures that when States act to address forced arbitration, as my home State of Vermont has, they are not preempted by an overbroad reading of our Federal arbitration laws.  This effort is supported by the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights, the National Employment Lawyers' Association, and consumer groups such as National Association of Consumer Advocates, Consumers Union, Public Citizen, the National Consumer Law Center, and Consumers for Auto Reliability and For years, these groups and many others have worked tirelessly to highlight the injustice of forced arbitration and the full scope of the number of people it affects.

10512,topic-id,965,"Mr.President, I want to express my serious concerns with the budget for fiscal year 2018 recently proposed by President If adopted, this budget would have severe consequences on many Americans, but I am particularly concerned that it would be low-income families who are impacted the most. As vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will do everything in my power to make sure that does not happen.  Among countless examples within a budget that is out of touch and that will drive more American families into poverty, the President's proposal to eliminate the Community Service Block Grant, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, and the Weatherization Assistance Program should be concerning to all of us. These are resources that are essential not only to Vermonters, but to millions of families throughout the country.  The Community Service Block Grant ensures that low-income families receive the support they need for basic food and housing assistance, financial planning tools, and fuel in winter months. LIHEAP and weatherization services ensure that families do not have to choose between food and heat. They ensure that families stay safe from harmful asbestos that may be in the walls of their old Vermont farmhouses or their inefficient mobile homes. In States like mine, home heating is a life-and-death matter.  We need to show compassion when drafting our budget and provide support for those programs that help hard-working families in need. We must see the faces behind these proposed budget cuts. Vulnerable people should never be at the whim of politically driven priorities.  We have to do better. I would like to begin by recognizing the crisis so many families will face in this country without the help of our community action agencies. Without them, families will go cold. They will choose not to eat so they can heat their homes. They will deny themselves healthcare and miss rent payments so that they can stay warm, so that they can stay alive.  Last month, I had the pleasure of seeing a longtime friend and fellow Vermonter Jan Demers, who serves as the executive director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, CVOEO, Vermont's largest community action agency in It was Jan who said it best, noting that, ``President Trump's budget is like one amputation after another. Not bringing health to the community but cut after cut--loss after loss.'' I am proud that CVOEO and the other community action agencies continue to meet the needs of these families and hope all Senators will continue to support them as I have during my time in the  In recognition of their leadership, I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Jan Demers be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Good morning, my name is Jan Demers and I am the Executive      Director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic      On behalf of the more than 23,000 Vermonters      that CVOEO serves: We are standing in CVOEOs      Weatherization It is a fitting place to talk about      President Trump's recently released budget. Thank you to      Senator Leahy and your staff for organizing this press      conference and for the leadership you provide for Vermont and      the nation. Thank you to Jonathan Bond and our staff and for      all the Community Action Agencies who carry on this good      work. Thank you to Bobby Arnell, Sean Brown, Sarah Phillips      and to our partners in the State of Vermont who uphold the      values of care and wellness for all And thank you      to Mr.Todd Alexander who typifies the strength of those we      serve.       Community Action Agencies exist to support community well-     being. We make sure that everyone can reach their potential      and fully contribute to the total strength of our      communities.       How does Mr.Trump's budget affect CVOEO? It zeros out the      Community Service Block Grant--$990,687. This is the      foundational grant that undergirds the majority of our      programs. It zeros out the Low Income Home Energy Assistance      Program (LIHEAP) that keeps Vermonters warm in the winter. It      zeros out the Department of Energy's Weatherization      Thankfully the State of Vermont is our main source of      Weatherization funding. However, this will mean that 30      Vermont homes will not be weatherized in our area. Just those      3 cuts amount to a total of $2,056,675.       On top of that there are the cuts to Head Start, Fair      Housing, Housing assistance, Mobile Home, and Voices Against      There isn't an area, program, staff person or any      of the 23,000 people we served that won't be touched and      experience devastation of services due to this budget.       We have heard over and over that the war on poverty didn't      work. However, when the programs that created the War on      Poverty in 1964 measured the percent of poverty it was at      20%. Seven years later the percentage of poverty was at 11%.      It worked! Then the years of cutting started, cut after cut      was enacted weakening the effort substantially. In 2012 the      measured percent of poverty was 15%. Currently the percentage      of poverty is 13.5%. To me that signifies that the measured      efforts put into place during the Obama years are working.       There isn't a CVOEO Program that isn't decimated by this      budget bringing great loss for the entire population of over      23,000 people that CVOEO served in FY 16. Community Action      Agencies exist to support community well-being. Instead of      health, this budget is like one amputation after another. Not      bringing health to the community but cut after cut--loss      after loss.       Our vision is bridging gaps and building futures for the      people we serve. This budget widens the chasm and diminishes      life.       This cannot be the last word in the Federal budget for FY      18.       Thank you, Senator Leahy for bringing us a better way.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2211.txt,1383,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,4.0,February
10664,topic-id,505,"Mr.President, I have come to this Chamber to pay tribute to Dermot Gallagher, an Irish diplomat and civil servant who I was deeply saddened to hear passed away on January 15, 2017, after a lifetime dedicated to public service.  Dermot Gallagher was a friend of the United His career overseas was bookended by tours here, having first been posted at the Irish consulate in San Francisco in 1971 before serving at the United Nations in New York, the Irish Embassy in London, with the European Commission in Brussels, as Irish Ambassador to Nigeria, and ultimately returning to the U.as the Irish Ambassador in  He is perhaps best known for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process. For decades, Dermot was involved in efforts to bring about peace and reconciliation. He was involved in the Sunningdale negotiations in 1973, implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the late 1980s, and ultimately the negotiations and implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, when he used his ``emollient style of negotiation and diplomacy,'' as former junior minister and former Senator Martin Mansergh aptly described, to make significant contributions.  Dermot was also my friend. Over the course of his 6 years as Ambassador, my wife Marcelle and I came to know Dermot and his wife, Maeve, and I was fortunate to retain his friendship long after he returned to Ireland to advance the cause of peace.  I fondly recall our discussions about the relationship between the U.S., and particularly Vermont, and Ireland over dinner while he was Ambassador, visiting with him over a decade later when he had returned to Ireland and I visited on a trade mission, and the many conversations between about our families, our shared heritage, and our passion for U.S.-Ireland relations and the cause of peace.  I shared a personal memory in Ireland nearly 20 years ago that is worth sharing again because it speaks to who Dermot was as a person. While he was Ambassador, I was discussing my family's Irish ancestry, and I told him I wished my father, Howard Francis Leahy, had still been with us to know my family was planning a trip to Dermot said to me, ``Pat, don't you think your father knows?'' It brought tears to my eyes. He was as personable and genuine as he was a skillful diplomat.  Perhaps his legacy has been best conveyed by the reaction of his former colleagues on learning of his passing, who described him as a ``gentleman,'' ``distinguished diplomat,'' and a ``brilliant, creative and warm human being.'' President Michael Higgins noted his significant contribution to the peace process. Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan lauded his ``talented service,'' marked by ``great loyalty and constant commitments.'' Prime Minister Enda Kenny described him as a ``patriot, an outstanding public servant who embodied the best of Ireland and its people.''  Dermot was all of these things, and he will be greatly missed, but affectionately remembered.  Marcelle and I send our deepest condolences to his wife, Maeve, and to their children, Fiona, Aoife, and                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS966.txt,1383,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,6.0,February

10609,topic-id,669,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  As has been amply discussed, the mandatory sanctions and fees in this bill would have a chilling effect on cutting-edge litigation. One type of cutting-edge litigation to suffer would be citizen lawsuits seeking enforcement of the foreign Emoluments The amendment proposed in this motion would exempt civil actions that implicate foreign emoluments.  Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution says: ``No person holding any office of profit or trust . . . shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.''  Why did the Founding Fathers write this? Concern that foreign governments might try to control They wanted to make sure that nothing--no gifts, no payments, no advantages of any kind--could be received by officers of the United States, including the President, unless Congress approved it. They wanted to make sure that loyalty was completely to America, not divided by obligations to foreign powers. So receipt of emoluments is a serious breach of the requirements of the Constitution unless Congress approves the payment.  Congress has not voted to approve payments by foreign governments to our Some Americans are considering legal action to protect America from a Presidential violation of the Emoluments  President Trump took the symbolic step of resigning from his businesses, but he still gets the income. Letting his family run his businesses doesn't solve the emoluments violations.  Here are some of the potential problems:  In February, China gave provisional approval for 31 new trademarks for The Trump Organization, which have been sought for a decade, to no avail, until he won the election. This is a benefit the Chinese Government gave to the President's business.  At Trump Tower in New York, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's large tenant, the United Arab Emirates, leases space, and the Saudi mission to the U.makes payments. Money from these foreign countries goes to the  The President is part owner of a New York building carrying a $950 million loan, partially held by the Bank of He literally owes the government of  The Embassy of Kuwait held its 600-guest National Day celebration at Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C., last month, proceeds to  The President has deals in When he announced the Muslim ban, Turkey's President called for President Trump's name to be removed from Trump Towers His company is currently involved in major licensing deals for that property.  Shortly after the election, the President met with former U.Independent Party leader Nigel Farage, to get help to get the view from his golf resorts in Scotland resolved. Both golf resorts he owns there are promoted by Scotland's official tourism agency.  Foreign government-owned broadcasts in several countries air the President's television program ``The Apprentice,'' resulting in royalties and other payments from these governments.  There may be many more business violations to the Emoluments Clause that are unknown due to the President's refusal to disclose his tax returns.  Congress could move to approve these questionable payments and benefits under Article 1, section 9 to solve the constitutional violation, although, in my view, that would not resolve concerns about divided loyalties.  But Congress has done nothing--neither enforce the clause nor authorize the payments. That is why patriotic citizens are returning to the third branch of government to defend the Constitution and the country.  America has never faced this situation before, and any litigation will, of course, be breaking new ground and, therefore, be more susceptible to the mandatory rule 11 fees required by the bill.  Citizens who seek a President free from foreign influence by bringing actions in court should not be penalized with the mandatory fees required by this bill.

10585,topic-id,536,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction This bill is supposedly aimed at preventing frivolous litigation, but it would, in fact, generate a whole new set of litigation, further clogging our overburdened Federal courts.  Under rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may impose sanctions on a party that files a frivolous case or motion. A party subject to a rule 11 violation has a 21-day safe harbor period to withdraw or correct its filing, and sanctions are purely discretionary. This rule serves a vital role in maintaining the integrity of our legal system without creating a chilling effect on presenting novel claims. Judges, when they see frivolous suits, can sanction them and do.  This bill, however, would restore a failed version of rule 11 that was enacted by the Judicial Conference in 1983, but which was repealed 10 years later because it led to disastrous results. Under this bill, sanctions would be mandatory whenever a court rules that rule 11 has been violated. The safe harbor period, when filings can be withdrawn or corrected, would be eliminated.  We do not have to speculate about what would happen as a result of this bill because we have a decade of experience that shows us how catastrophic it would be and was. Under the 1983 rule, which this bill would restore, rule 11 battles became a routine part of civil litigation, affecting one-third of all cases. Rather than serving as a disincentive, the old rule 11 actually made the system even more litigious.  In the decade following the 1983 amendments, there were almost 7,000 reported rule 11 cases, becoming part of approximately one-third of all Federal civil lawsuits. Civil cases effectively became two cases, one on the merits and the other on a set of dueling rule 11 allegations by both parties. The drain on the courts and the parties' resources caused the Judicial Conference to revisit the rule and adopt the changes that this bill would now have us undo.  More troubling was the 1983 rule's impact on civil rights cases, which are often based on novel claims that require significant discovery to establish. A 1991 Federal Judicial Center study found that whereas civil rights cases made up 11.4 percent of Federal cases filed, they constituted 22.7 percent of the cases in which sanctions were imposed. If we return to the old rule, we could see a chilling effect in which untested, but no less valid, civil rights claims are never brought for fear of sanctions.  The courts have ample authority to sanction conduct that undermines the integrity of our legal system. But this legislation is not just a solution in search of a problem. By taking us back to a time when rule 11 actually promoted routine, costly, and unnecessary litigation, this bill is a cure worse than the disease.  Given that we already know this bill will be a failure, one wonders how it would survive its own rule 11 motion if Congress had such a thing. The courts, having tried it for 10 years with disastrous results, rightly rejected this approach 20 years ago, and we should reject it again. I urge a ``no'' vote.

In 1959, Mr.Ilitch and his wife, Marian, opened their first pizza store in the Detroit suburb of Garden City: Little Caesars While Mr.Ilitch initially named the pizzeria Pizza Treat, his wife Marian convinced him to change it to Little Caesar, her nickname for him. Over four decades, Mr.Ilitch expanded the business to approximately 4,000 stores across North America and parts of The chain became well-known for its commercial tagline, ``Pizza! Pizza!''  As Little Caesars grew to be one of the largest carryout pizza chains in the United States, Mr.Ilitch purchased the Detroit Red Wings hockey team in 1982, recognizing the great potential of a then failing team. By stocking the team with promising college players, Mr.Ilitch revitalized the Red Under Mr.Ilitch, the Red Wings won four Stanley Cup titles in 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2008, which led him to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2003, as well as the U.Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004.

Mr.Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus is a body of 49 members in both houses of Congress representing millions of African Americans and other minorities and majority people across this country. We are alarmed by the recent actions of this administration and the threat those actions pose to the hard-fought progress of African descendants and minorities in this country.  The nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General for many minorities across this country was a direct affront to the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., Stokely Carmichael, our colleague John Lewis, and the many others who sacrificed and dedicated their lives to the civil rights movement and the right to vote. The concerns expressed by the great Coretta Scott King 30 years ago about the dubious past of Mr.Sessions with respect to enforcing civil rights laws remain the same for many Americans today. Mr.Speaker, the American Dream was, in fact, made possible by the plight of African descendants, and we must remain vigilant and steadfast in the fight against racial, social, and economic injustice.  Mr.Speaker, I want to raise another area of concern that African Americans have, and that is for health care. My district of the U.Virgin Islands, home to the first African-American female physician in Congress, my esteemed predecessor, Donna Christensen, like many underserved communities across the country, is adversely impacted by disparate health outcomes. Diabetes, hypertension, along with funding for disease such as sickle cell, may be adversely affected in this administration. Programs for nutrition and preventative health, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs, or SNAP, provide critical food to the neediest in all of our communities, especially mine, the Virgin Islands, and especially to our children.  Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would create unhealthy African-American communities. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed, nearly half of the African-American adults who didn't have health insurance now have health insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, the number of working-age African-American adults who are uninsured has been cut from 27 percent to 14 percent, the lowest rate ever. The number of African-American children without insurance also decreased to the lowest rate ever, negative 5 percent. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would take away coverage for more than 3.3 million African In my district, we are looking for ways to expand coverage, not to remove or repeal it.  Members of this caucus and members before us have offered policy solutions and continue to push policies and initiatives that would help African-American communities because we know the work that our communities have done, the work of our forefathers to ensure that we have a place at the table; individuals like Shirley Chisholm, as was[[Page H1121]]spoken about by my colleague Sheila Jackson People who have come to America to be part of the experience of the African diaspora are people from many parts of the Right now we have Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, representing the Ninth District of New York, of Jamaican descent.

10695,topic-id,1090,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute to the life of a famous Ohioan, Henry  The son of Jewish immigrants who fled Central and Eastern Europe for a better life in America, Henry Judah Heimlich spent his life helping others.  As a 21-year-old medical student, he was riding a train from Connecticut to New York City when the train derailed. Henry rescued one of his fellow passengers that day. That was the first of the many lives he would save.  By 23, he had his medical degree. Two years later, he left his internship at Boston City Hospital to serve in the Navy during World War He was sent to treat American Marines and Chinese soldiers in the Gobi desert of Inner Mongolia, behind Japanese lines. In those rugged conditions, he came up with a new solution to help there hundreds of people there who had a certain bacterial infection that caused blindness.  In 1957, after sketching the idea on the back of a napkin, he became the first American doctor to repair a damaged esophagus using a tube made from the patient's stomach. A year later, it became a standard procedure in the United  In 1964, based on those experiences during World War II operating without electricity in the Gobi desert, he invented the Heimlich chest drain valve, which drained blood and air out of the chest to help those with gunshot wounds or collapsed lungs. It all started with a toy noisemaker he found at a dime store. He noticed that the toy had a flutter valve, which he realized could be used as a model for a valve to prevent fluids from flowing back into the lungs.  This invention was immediately used to save the lives of American soldiers serving in Vietnam, and more than 4 million of these valves have sold since then.  In 1968, Heimlich moved to my hometown of Cincinnati and became surgery director of Jewish Hospital and professor of surgery at the University of He taught at UC until 1978, when he became a professor of advanced clinical science at Cincinnati's Xavier He taught at Xavier until 1989.  In 1974, he became famous around the world for finding a better way to save someone from choking.  At that time, some 4,000 Americans were dying every year from choking, and it was one of the leading causes of accidental death. Many of those victims were kids who choked on small toys.  With a great feeling of compassion for them, Heimlich set out to find a solution. Whatever it was, it would have to be a quick and efficient solution because, within just 4 minutes of being deprived of oxygen, the brain becomes irreversibly damaged.  Heimlich thought that the conventional techniques used at that time were not just ineffective but actually harmful because they risked pushing the blockage farther down the windpipe, making the problem worse.  At Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati, Heimlich led 2 years of research that discovered a new, more effective technique of dislodging objects from the esophagus: putting pressure just below the diaphragm to create upward air pressure in the chest. Just days after it was made public, a restaurant owner in Washington State used it to save someone's life.  It was simple and easy--so simple that, within a few years, a 5-year-old boy in Massachusetts used it to save one of his friends. You can even use it on yourself if necessary.  As Heimlich put it, ``the best thing about it is that it allows anyone to use it to save a life.'' Everyone can and should learn this technique.[[Page S591]]  Letters began pouring in. Within a year, Heimlich received some 200 from people around the country who had successfully used the Heimlich maneuver to save a life and the American Medical Association had endorsed it. Within 2 years, the American Red Cross recommended it.  The Heimlich maneuver is estimated by some to have saved as many as 50,000 or even 100,000 lives just in America--not to mention countless others around the world.  To put a face to these numbers, consider that the Heimlich maneuver has saved the lives of future-President Ronald Reagan in 1976. It has saved the lives of New York City Mayor Ed Koch, basketball commentator Dick Vitale, news anchorman John Chancellor, television personality Simon Cowell, as well as actors Walter Matthau, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlene Dietrich, Carrie Fisher, Goldie Hawn, Nicole Kidman, and Halle Berry, and so many other people who have touched our lives. The maneuver has been used by Cincinnati Reds third basemen Todd Frazier, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp David, and an 83-year-old Clint  We have all benefited from this innovative technique.  This discovery, I think, really sums up Heimlich's life, because he used to say that his focus was to find ``simple, creative solutions to seemingly insurmountable health and medical problems.'' Time and again, he did just that, authoring more than 100 scientific papers and presenting more than 250 medical lectures over his lifetime.  In 1980, he invented the MicroTrach, a more efficient portable oxygen system that, because of its smaller size, gave patients more mobility. In 1981, Heimlich received the ``Distinguished Service Award'' from his colleagues with the American Society of Abdominal Surgeons, and he received the 1984 ``Arthur Lasker Award for Public Service'' for his ``simple, practical, cost-free solution to a life-threatening emergency, requiring neither great strength, [nor] special equipment [n]or elaborate training.''  In 1985, Surgeon General Everett Koop declared that the Heimlich maneuver was the best method to be used when someone is choking. From 1986 to 2005, the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association issued the same recommendation.  Heimlich's medical career lasted some 70 years. In his final years, he remained active, swimming and exercising regularly. Living at a retirement home run by Episcopal Retirement Services in Cincinnati, he saved the life of an 87-year-old fellow resident named Patty Ris this past May using his famous maneuver.  Heimlich passed away on December 17 at age 96 at Christ Hospital in He was married to his wonderful wife, Jane, for 61 years, and he is survived by his four children and three grandchildren.

10451,topic-id,776,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act of 2017 along with two members of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Collins, and the ranking member, Senator In response to data breaches of various companies that exposed the personal information of millions of customers, our legislation asks each publicly traded company to include--in Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures to investors--information on whether any member of the board of directors is a cybersecurity expert, and if why having this expertise on the board of directors is not necessary because of other cyber security steps taken by the publicly traded company. To be clear, the legislation does not require companies to take any actions other than to provide this disclosure to its investors.  Many investors may be surprised to learn that board directors who participated in the National Association of Corporate Directors, NACD, roundtable discussions on cyber security late in 2013 admitted that ``the lack of adequate knowledge of information technology risk has made it challenging for them to `effectively oversee management's cybersecurity activities.' '' More recently, in Deloitte's 10th Global Risk Management Survey of Financial Services Institutions, published this month, 42 percent of respondents considered their institution to be less effective in managing cybersecurity. And according to the 2016-2017 NACD Public Company Governance Survey, ``fifty-nine percent of respondents reported that they find it challenging to oversee cyber risk, and only 19 percent of respondents said that their boards possess a high level of knowledge about cybersecurity.'' Indeed, Yahoo in its most recent annual report, which was filed with the SEC last week, disclosed that ``the Independent Committee found that failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting contributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the 2014 Security The Independent Committee also found that the Audit and Finance Committee and the full board were not adequately informed of the full severity, risks, and potential impacts of the 2014 Security Incident and related matters.'' The 2014 Security Incident here refers to the fact that ``a copy of certain user account information for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from Yahoo's network in late 2014.'' This is particularly troubling given that data breaches are on the rise. Indeed, 2016 was a recordbreaking year for data breaches, which increased 40 percent from the prior year to 1,093 breaches according to the Identity Theft Resource  Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether publicly traded companies are prioritizing cyber security and have the capacity to protect investors and customers from cyber-related attacks. Our legislation aims to provide a better understanding of these issues through improved SEC disclosure.  While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking Committee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my service on the Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on It is through this Banking-Armed Services-Intelligence perspective that I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of our national security, and this is particularly the case as our economy becomes increasingly reliant on technology and the  For example, when he was Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, appeared before the Armed Services Committee in 2015 and testified that ``cyber threats to the U.national and economic security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication and severity of impact.'' He further said that ``[b]ecause of our heavy dependence on the Internet, nearly all information communication technologies and I.networks and systems will be perpetually at risk.''  Indeed, retired Army GEN Keith Alexander, who is the former commander of the United States Cyber Command and former Director of the National Security Agency, appeared before the Armed Services Committee this month and stated that ``while the primary responsibility of government is to defend the nation, the private sector also shares responsibility in creating the partnership necessary to make the defense of our nation possible. Neither the government nor the private sector can capably protect their systems and networks without extensive and close cooperation.''  With mounting cyber threats and concerns over the capabilities of corporate directors, we all need to be more proactive in ensuring our Nation's cyber security before there are additional serious breaches. This legislation seeks to take one step toward that[[Page S1642]]goal by encouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to their investors and customers on whether and how their boards of directors are prioritizing cyber security.  I thank Harvard Law School professor John Coates, MIT professor Simon Johnson, Columbia Law School professor John Coffee, and the Consumer Federation of America for their support, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins, Senator Warner, and me in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1641.txt,1982,COMPETITIVE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2017,2017.0,7.0,March
10528,topic-id,1079,"Mr.President, I voted to support Lieutenant General H.McMaster retaining the grade of lieutenant general while serving as the National Security Advisor to the To be clear, this vote was to permit Lieutenant General McMaster to remain in the grade of lieutenant general while serving in this position. It is not to confirm him as the National Security  Lieutenant General McMaster was appointed by the President to a position that does not require Senate confirmation. Indeed, he is already serving as National Security The only remaining question is whether he will serve in the military grade of lieutenant general on Active  The position of National Security Advisor is one of the most important in our government. Not only does it require someone capable of providing timely and thoughtful counsel on national security matters, it entails coordinating advice and action across multiple executive agencies with responsibilities in the national security arena. Further, it necessitates a large measure of independence and knowledge.  This is not the first time we have considered an Active-Duty military officer for this position. Lieutenant General McMaster would be the third such officer to so serve, following Admiral John Poindexter under President Reagan and General Colin Powell under President George Herbert Walker  Many of my colleagues are rightly concerned about this and question whether it would be more appropriate for him to retire and serve in a civilian capacity. While I strongly believe it would be better for Lieutenant General McMaster to retire and avoid all perceptions of politicizing the military, he believes that serving in uniform will help him remain apolitical in service to this He can expect Congress to hold him to his word that wearing the uniform in this position will serve to keep the military above the political fray.  Some Members have expressed concern about the proper functioning of our national security apparatus and clear chains of command with respect to military advice provided to the President under this arrangement. While Lieutenant General McMaster would be the National Security Advisor to the President, providing day-to-day advice and counsel on all national security matters, General Joseph Dunford, as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would continue to be the ``principal military advisor'' to the President, while Secretary Mattis is the ``principal assistant to the President in all matters related to the Department of Defense.''  As Senator Sam Nunn described the issue with respect to the nomination of then-Lieutenant General Powell, in Senator Nunn's words, ``A military officer who knows that his next promotion depends on the Secretary of Defense and the top generals and admirals in the Pentagon may simply not, over a period of time, be able to make completely objective decisions based on the fact that his promotion, his pay, and his future depend on one department, and that one department is an active player in the government.''  This question centers on Lieutenant General McMaster's ability to retain the necessary measure of independence as he discharges his duties to the I ultimately believe, after careful consideration, that Lieutenant General McMaster will be able to balance these roles and provide advice and direction designed to further the Nation's interests and not simply those of the Department of Defense or indeed, to advance his own ambitions.  It is also my hope that Lieutenant General McMaster will be a moderating influence on a White House that desperately needs talented, informed, and professional advisers. This Administration has proposed a reorganization of the National Security Council structure that excludes the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence from meetings unless specifically invited. Lieutenant General McMaster assured the Committee that General Dunford and the DNI will be invited to attend any meeting of the Principals Committee of the National Security Council, and I appreciated that assurance.  The Trump Administration reorganization also added the President's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, to the National Security This politicization of the NSC is unsound, and I think without merit. The law creating the National Security Council is purposeful in trying to create a managerial and policy process that develops the best national security policy for our The idea that a partisan political operative like Mr.Bannon should serve on the National Security Council runs counter to longstanding practice, and must, in my view, be reversed.  It is my hope that Lieutenant General McMaster has the vast experience and knowledge and the requisite temperament and independence to provide the national security expertise that is sorely needed in the White  Moreover, Lieutenant General McMaster must have the support and the backing of the President so it is clear that he runs the National Security Council on the President's behalf. That support is not yet apparent. According to Politico just a few days ago, the President overruled Lieutenant General McMaster's advice and chose to listen to Mr.Bannon and the President's son-in-law, Mr.Kushner, in regard to the retention of a key intelligence analyst who had been brought in by Major General This is a worrisome sign that Lieutenant General McMaster might have a title and responsibilities but not the authority he needs. I indeed hope he has that authority and exercises it wisely.  I would also like to note that there have been reports about decisions Lieutenant General McMaster made as Commanding General at Fort Benning in allowing lieutenants under his command to attend schools while being investigated for allegations of sexual misconduct. I want to assure my colleagues that the Committee held a closed and classified executive session with Lieutenant General McMaster present to answer all our questions. The Committee thoroughly considered the facts and voted to confirm his third star by a strong bipartisan vote.  We are again taking a rather extraordinary step in voting on an Active-Duty military officer to serve as National Security Advisor for the first time in 25 years, but these are extraordinary times. Our Nation faces complex national security challenges, and 3 months into a new administration, we are on a second National Security Advisor already. We see a disorganized National Security Council and an enormous number of vacancies in the State and Defense  Lieutenant General McMaster has the opportunity to bring order to the chaos. Therefore, I believe the Senate should confirm his grade of Lieutenant General while he serves as National Security Advisor.[[Page S1826]]  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

10643,topic-id,662,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, last night, in an effort to secure more votes to pass the so-called American Health Care Act, the GOP made another last-minute attempt to modify its replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act--a replacement that I can only describe as a disastrous piece of legislation--by offering a short-term fix to try and regulate the massive rise in premiums that Americans over the age of 50 are expected to incur under their current plan.  H.372 is a measure that simply ends health insurance antitrust exemption. What is ironic is that the proposed legislation is being messaged by the GOP as a bipartisan bill, a no-brainer. But Republicans have never lifted a finger to end the antitrust exemption. For years, Congressman John Conyers and the Democrats have advocated ending health insurers' special treatment.  The reality is, while this is an unobjectionable bill on its own, H.372 has nothing to do with reversing the extraordinary damage that the GOP plan will unleash on this country. The fact is this will not help us solve the fundamental issues underlying the GOP's repeal-and-replace bill. Yet, instead of fixing what we know is not working under the current law, the GOP has offered this Band-Aid to help mend a bill that needs major surgery. H.372 is simply a complement to help fix our healthcare system, not an alternative.  One of the worst aspects of the GOP's repeal is the fact that it implements an age tax. Americans over the age of 50 will be forced to pay up to five times more than what young Americans would pay for coverage. In my district alone, we have roughly 89,000 people between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums and the cost of their insurance rise significantly.  I recently heard from one of my constituents within that age bracket. He is a retired firefighter who served our country for 29 years and is now disabled. So after many years of service, Ted is worried that if the GOP plan becomes the new law, he and his wife would be kicked off their insurance plans simply because their insurance would become unaffordable.  If this is what the GOP has offered to fix their disastrous repeal, then I am sad to say, my friends, you have missed the mark once again. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the GOP repeal is enacted, 14 million Americans nationwide will be kicked off their insurance coverage by the end of this year alone.  So let me be clear. The problem with the GOP repeal is that as Americans age, they get less and less coverage. We need to protect those Americans who are fast approaching their Medicare-eligible years but who, for now, are still bearing the heaviest cost of private insurance.  My motion to recommit makes this possible by turning this Band-Aid of a bill into something that actually helps drive down costs for older It does this by allowing insurance companies to take part in the bill's safe harbor protections only if they charge individuals over 55 less than three times as much as younger Since insurance companies consider these safe harbors critical for their survival, this will reverse one of the worst parts of the Republican health plan, allowing insurance companies to charge older Americans five times or even more for health insurance.  I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to show that they aren't tone deaf and that they haven't lost touch with the needs and wants of their constituents, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to recommit so that we can protect our seniors and the most vulnerable of Americans among us.

10563,topic-id,685,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.1294, the Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth  The Department of Homeland Security, DHS, spends over $7 billion, annually, on major acquisition programs. These programs secure our borders, protect our shores, safeguard our airports, and defend our cyber networks, among other critical missions. Unfortunately, the Government Accountability Office has reported that DHS acquisition management is on its high-risk list, since 2003, of areas most susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Recent watchdog reports have revealed alarming findings regarding DHS' acquisition efforts.  For example, in just 2016 alone, 8 out of 25 major acquisition programs experienced cost growth, schedule slips, or both. These program cost estimates increased by $1.7 billion, and their schedules slipped by an average of 11 months. Given the enormous threats that are facing our homeland, it is unacceptable to make our frontline operators wait for the tools that they need to secure the homeland.  My bill will require much-needed oversight of DHS' acquisition programs to safeguard tax dollars and hold program managers accountable. When programs incur significant cost, schedule, or requirement problems, my bill requires that DHS leadership be informed. These programs will be required to put a remediation plan in place that corrects the problem and also analyzes the root causes of why the problems occurred in the first place.  The Homeland Security Committee in Congress must also be informed of such significant problems. No longer will the people's representatives in Congress be kept in the dark. These requirements are similar to those used in the Department of Defense and will help DHS better safeguard tax dollars and more effectively secure our homeland.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Miss RICE of New Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1294, the Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth Since the Department began its operations in 2002, it has spent tens of billions of dollars to procure goods, services, and supplies in support of DHS' national security efforts. The agency's major acquisitions investments, those that cost at least $300 million, represent a significant portion of such purchasing.  The Department has worked to improve its acquisition programs in recent years, but DHS still struggles when it comes to major acquisitions. Take, for example, the SBInet--a southwest border infrastructure project--that ballooned in cost to about $1 billion before it was canceled in 2011, after GAO found that it was ineffective.  More recently, there is the case of the Electronic Immigration System, an automated immigration benefits processing system. According to the Department's inspector general, this U.citizenship immigration services program is now on course to be completed 4 years later than originally estimated and at a cost of $1 billion more than estimated.  The importance and complexity of DHS' mission demands effective oversight of the Department's investments, particularly its major acquisitions. H.1294 seeks to ensure greater congressional oversight of such acquisition programs by requiring the Department to report to Congress when cost, schedule, and performance requirements are not met. Additionally, when such requirements are not met, this bill requires DHS to provide Congress with an analysis explaining the root cause of the failures as well as a remediation plan to mitigate the problems.  The Committee on Homeland Security unanimously approved this measure earlier this month, and similar language was approved by the House in October 2015 as a part of comprehensive DHS acquisition legislation.[[Page H2215]]  I commend my colleague from Florida for his work on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, effective oversight of the Department's acquisitions programs is essential to ensuring optimal program performance. Given DHS' limited budgetary resources and the gravity of its mission, it is critically important that DHS get its major acquisitions right. Enacting this legislation would require a greater level of accountability from DHS and give Congress a greater level of oversight to intercede before programs go off the rails.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of H.1294, and I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2213.txt,99999999999999,LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,20.0,March

The material follows:        quinn nelson mayo, st. johnsbury academy junior (winner)       The United States was founded onseveral core values; the      most important, as most of us agree, is freedom. This shared      belief has been the foundation of ourcountry for over 200      years. And for centuries, media has been a major outlet for      people to exercise this freedom because itallows them to      share their opinions with the masses. The idea of free speech      took on a different meaning with the development ofthe      internet in the late 80s. Since then, this liberty has grown      exponentially. Now people have the ability to share      theirthoughts with a much larger audience. It is possible to      do this anonymously and without fear of consequence. The      internet is anincredible asset which has helped with      globalization and the spread of information. However, this      form of media does have itsdrawbacks. The leading issue is      that it enables the spread of false information. So, while      the internet embodies our nation'score value of freedom, it      can also be detrimental to another vital aspect of our      society: educated and well informedcitizens.       Regardless of one's political views, we can all agree that      2016 has been a tumultuous year for politics, here inthe      United States and across the globe. The 2016 presidential      campaign was a dramatic affair, and just the opening act to      one ofthe most high-stakes elections in our country's      history. The actions and rhetoric of the president-elect have      inspired a greatpolitical shift, as well as a burgeoning      sense of xenophobia and hatred throughout the country. During      times such as these, itis important to focus on what we can      do to create a better future. Much of the hate directed      towards certain groups of people isdue to ignorance and can      be traced back to stereotypes perpetrated by unreliable media      sources. Forcing media sites todrastically increase their      censorship would rightfully anger their users, on the grounds      that it restricts their constitutionalright to free speech.      Therefore, the most plausible and effective solution to the      problem of misinformation is to educatepeople.       As of this year, 78% of the United States population has a      social media profile (Statista). Facebook and Twitter      havebillions of users across the world. It is imperative that      we use such sites with care. The recent controversies over      fake newshave made the influence of the media on politics      increasingly apparent. The rumor now known as ``Pizzagate''      is a prime exampleof a fake news story with tremendous      influence. Millions of people believed that Hillary Clinton      was involved in a child-prostitution ring run out of a pizza      parlor. This is because, for a vast number of people, social      media and biased news sourcesare their only ways of acquiring      information. In fact, it is estimated that 62% of American      adults use social media at leastoccasionally as a news source      (Pew Research Center). However, many blindly make the      assumption that it is accurate. Whenhundreds of thousands of      people are susceptible to hate-driven fake news, it can have      a huge impact on our democracy.       This iswhy I propose the incorporation of media literacy as      a core subject in all public schools. Public schools educate      the majorityof our nation's children. Which is why, by      teaching America's youth how to approach sources impartially      and critically, we canfix this problem of misinformation.      Integrating media literacy as a required course at elementary      and high-school levels is aninvestment in our future      generations.        musa mayange, winooski high school senior (secondplace)       Twelve years and still no change.

Racism exists in Surveys reveal that whites apply      stereotypical thinkingabout blacks, considering them lazy and      unintelligent. What are we going to do about these attitudes      towards persons ofcolor?       The American National Election Studies asked voters to rank      blacks and whites from hardworking to lazy, fromintelligent      to unintelligent. In 2012, 62 percent of whites gave blacks a      lower score in at least one area. In 2008, 45 percentof      whites expressed negative feelings about black stereotypes.      (Milbank, Washington Post)       For a while, we thought that theissue of racism was over      and that our nation was going to move forward and ``leave the      past in the past.'' It almost had mefooled because we live in      Vermont and we sometimes can be isolated from world issues.      But racism is still here. When everyonethought that it was no      longer ``relevant,'' it's still alive.       As a young African-American immigrant, how can I wrap my      headaround this? As Vermonters how can we annihilate racism      and get our community to be accepting of all races, cultures,      and ethnicbackgrounds?       Ta-Nehisi Coates addresses the disadvantages of living with      black skin in Between the World And Coates says``. . .      today, when 8% of the world's prisoners are black men, our      race has been refinanced to the Dream of being white.      Blacklife is cheap, but in America, black bodies are a      natural resource of incomparable value.'' Black people are      born with adisadvantage. We are more likely to go jail than      white people. The Center for American Progress says, ``In the      United States,black people account for 60 percent of those      imprisoned. The prison population grew by 700 percent from      1970 to 2005, a ratethat is outpacing crime and population      rates.       Black people make up 17% of the United States population      yet more of us are injail. A black man is twice as likely to      go to jail than a white man, even if they did the same crime.       Racism was born whenhumans identified skin color as a      positive or negative factor. If each of us could accept that      we are all humans, we come fromdifferent places, and have      different interests, we could accept racial differences, but      not let them divide us. We will nevermove forward if we don't      work together side by side and knock down obstacles.        aj defelice,hartford high school freshman (third place)       The United States is one of the greatest countries onEarth,      prized for its natural beauty, economic opportunities, and      democratic principles. However, many challenges face      ournation. Among the most pressing issues are climate change,      immigration, and income inequality.       Perhaps the most dauntingproblem we face is climate change,      and the crucial role our country plays in it. Although      President Obama recently signed theParis Agreement to limit      greenhouse gas emissions, much must still be done to combat      this issue. We can begin by puttingunemployed or low-income      Americans to work--manufacturing, transporting, and      installing renewable energy products--such as solarpanels,      wind turbines, and more. This would produce a similar effect      as the New Deal put into place by President Franklin      D.Roosevelt to combat the negative effects of the Great      Additionally, a carbon tax should be established      nationally,to lower emissions, and encourage the usage of      renewable energy. A carbon tax would also allow for tax      reductions in otherareas, and combined with employing      Americans to transition to widespread renewable energy, would      create economic growth, whilesimultaneously reducing our      carbon footprint.       Another controversial issue which troubles our nation is      immigration. TheUnited States is a country built on the backs      of immigrants, and to deny a path to citizenship to millions      who long only for ahigher quality of life is unpatriotic. We      must stop dehumanizing these people and see them only for who      they are--people.Immigrants strengthen our economy, whether      it be as producers, consumers, or developers. To deny them      access to citizenship inour nation would be depriving      ourselves of economic growth and cultural diversity. Economic      and cultural change that would onlystrengthen American      society.       Income inequality is another issue which plagues our nation      today. According to countless yearsof research, income      inequality has a direct correlation on social and health      issues. A study conducted by the University ofWisconsin found      that people who reside in more financially unequal      communities are more likely to die before the age of 75.      Asnational income inequality decreases, so do social and      health problems. This decline can be seen in Scandinavian      countries,where having a more equal gross domestic product      per capita results in a higher quality of life. To make this      possible for theUnited States, corporations must be regulated      and held accountable by lawmakers to be sure that the      American people arereceiving the representation they deserve.      As citizens, we must be responsible in electing officials who      will place the needs ofthe greater population[[Page S360]]     above the interests of wealthy corporate executives.       Our nation is at a turning point in itshistory, and the      choices we make today will have lasting effects on future      generations.       The United States of America willremain a strong,      respected, and prosperous nation if we are able to look past      our disagreements and focus on making progressthrough      compromise. We must act wisely, and keep our eyes on what is      most important--the liberty we treasure as our      nation'scrowning promise.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS359.txt,1010,AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET,2017.0,20.0,March
10516,topic-id,872,"Mr.President, I have another subject I wish to talk about, and maybe this one will be a little more constructive right now in terms of my Republican leader's response because he and I yesterday had a constructive meeting on the matter of processing the President-elect's nominations to the We are still working out several details, but on this issue I want to express my appreciation for the majority leader's willingness to have a dialogue and work in good faith toward a process both sides of the aisle can live with.  Our caucus thinks it is absolutely essential that the Senate has a chance to appropriately vet the nominees, and the American people deserve to hear their views and qualifications in public hearings, especially for the most powerful Cabinet positions. We all know Cabinet officials have enormous power and influence over the lives of everyday They run massive government agencies that do the actual work of implementing our laws, keeping our Nation safe from terrorism, protecting the environment and civil rights, promoting clean energy and affordable housing--on and on. Every facet of public life is governed by a very powerful Cabinet official.  It is only right that we in the Senate--and by extension the American people--get to thoroughly vet their baseline acceptability for these jobs. That means getting their financial records to make sure they don't come into public office with standing conflicts of interest, and if potential conflicts of interest are found, making sure they have a plan to divest the assets in question, making sure the FBI has had the time to complete a full background check. It means making sure the independent ethics officers of each agency can sign off on them.  All of these benchmarks are standard protocol. All were done by about this time 8 years ago by the Obama administration. They are not onerous requirements. They are necessary requirements to prevent conflicts of interest.  I remind my colleagues again, every Obama Cabinet nominee had an ethics agreement in before their hearing. Every Obama Cabinet nominee underwent a full FBI background check before the Senate considered their nomination. For such positions of influence in our government, it is the responsibility of the Senate to guarantee that we have all the information we need on each nominee and in a timely fashion.  Truth be told, the slate of nominations selected by President-Elect Trump has made this process--standard for nominees of Presidents of both parties--immensely difficult. There are several nominees who have enormous wealth and own stock of enormous value. We have a CEO of one of the largest oil companies in the world, a billionaire financial services executive financier--oh, and another billionaire financial services executive.  Leaving aside for a moment what that says about the President-elect's priorities for his incoming administration, these nominees have potential conflict of interest challenges of epic proportions. At the very least--at the very least--they owe the American people the standard paperwork, and in fact we believe many of these nominees, given their financial holdings, should go one step further and provide their tax returns.  The minority only has ethics agreements in for four of the nominees so far. We only have financial disclosure forms from four of the nominees so far. We only have tax returns for four of the nominees so far. None of our committees has been notified that any nominees' FBI background check has been fully completed. Briefings have started, but they are far from complete.  As I said earlier, I hope the majority leader and I can work out an arrangement that works for both of our caucuses to process these nominees in a fair but thorough fashion. It certainly shouldn't be the case, as seems to be planned now, that six hearings--several on very important nominees--all occur on the same day and on the same day as a potential vote-arama. That is mostly unprecedented in the modern era of Cabinet considerations, happening only once in history. That is not the standard, but right now that is the case on January 11.  There are Members who sit on multiple committees. One of our Members chairs one of the committees, Judiciary, but has been very active on the Intelligence Committee--both nominees in a single day. That is unfair, not only to her, with her great knowledge, but to the American people. Each member deserves plenty of time to question each nominee, and if questions remain, they should be brought back for a second day of hearings.  After all, they are going to hold incredibly powerful positions for potentially the next 4 years. To spend an extra day or two on each nominee, if it takes a few weeks, several weeks, to get through them all in order to carefully consider their nominations, that is certainly worth it to the American people and, I would argue, to the new administration.  I have made these points to the majority leader, and I must say he has respectfully listened. I am hopeful we can find an agreement that alleviates the crunch and gives Senators and committees the opportunity to process these nominations with the proper care and oversight, with all of the proper paperwork in place, thoughtfully and thoroughly.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-2.txt,1036,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,5.0,March

10591,topic-id,615,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would reinstate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 11(c)(2) safe harbor provision, which allows parties to avoid penalties, by withdrawing or correcting the claims within 14 days from when the alleged violation of rule 11(b) becomes known, anytime up until the end of the discovery period.  This bill would force attorneys to assess their case blindly as it stands. Every attorney knows to assess their case based upon an objective set of facts regarding the situation.  A good attorney would never overpromise a cause of action, but this bill prevents even a fair assessment of a case. A full and accurate analysis of the merits of the case must be done on day one, because this bill requires mandatory sanctions with no grace period. We have tried this already, and it did not work.  This bill will eliminate rule 11(c)(2)'s safe harbor provision, which currently allows the target of a rule 11 motion for sanctions to withdraw or correct the paper claim, defense, contention, or denial that is the subject of the motion for sanctions within 21 days after service.  Between 1938 and 1983, there were only 19 rule 11 filings. In 1983, rule 11 was changed to the standard being proposed by this bill. In the 10 years without this safe harbor provision, nearly 7,000 motions for sanctions were made. A 1989 study showed that roughly one-third of all Federal civil lawsuits involved rule 11 satellite litigation, and approximately one-fourth of all those cases on the docket involved rule 11 actions that did not result in sanctions. Thus, attorneys had a dual job: one to try the case, and the other to try the opposing counsel.  We can't go back to a failed system. The amount of sanction litigation that clogged the system was so extensive that in 1993, a mere 10 years after this failed legal experiment began, a safe harbor provision was established to unclog the system, and it worked. Since then, the amount of rule 11 sanction satellite litigation has come down, and the courts are now better able to focus on the case at hand.  In committee, Mr.Cicilline of Rhode Island, recommended the reimplementation of the 21-day safe harbor provision.                              {time}  1000  Instead of following this commonsense proposal, the committee rejected it by an 18-4 vote. I believe such an important provision needs to be revisited, but with a compromise. That is why I drafted this amendment that offers a 14-day safe harbor provision; and as a measure to protect further abuse, my safe harbor amendment is only available prior to the completion of discovery, yet another attempt to have a compromise here.  The intent for this discovery provision is that an attorney, during discovery, may realize a flaw in their case. Such a revelation should allow an attorney to correct or withdraw their claim without having the fear of having mandatory automatic sanctions imposed on them. Instead, this bill, as written, immediately places sanctions on the mistaken lawyer. This is well-intentioned, but it does not acknowledge the realities of litigation or the legal process.  In the real world, clients can easily misrepresent a situation to their counsel, and the truth won't be known until discovery. This bill will have a stifling effect on the legal community and will lead to denied justice because attorneys will not be willing to take a case unless it is a guaranteed win.  We should take the lessons learned from the 1983 experiment and preserve the safe harbor provision to protect well-intended plaintiffs' attorneys and not stack the deck against those who seek justice.

And the cost of liberty has come at a steep price for members of the Black community. But despite this immense challenge the Black community has faced, our resiliency is what we celebrate every month during Black History  Every February, we get together to talk about it, highlight it, and share with school children, friends, and family the accomplishments of the men and women who changed the course of American history. We thank these pioneers for expanding what we believed possible and use them as an inspiration for the fight that remains.  There have been so many African-American pioneers in every field, including medicine. James McCune Smith was the first African American to earn a medical degree and practice medicine in the U.S.; Daniel Hale Williams owned the first Black-owned hospital and is credited with the first successful heart surgery performed by an African American; Charles Drew--many have heard of him--renowned for his research during World War II which allowed for us to better understand blood plasma and its storage for transfusions. More recently, Regina Benjamin became the first Black woman elected to the American Medical Association Board of Trustees and was appointed the 18th surgeon general by President Barack Obama in 2009.  Each of these medical pioneers broke barriers for the betterment of the community, and each worked to use tools of their profession to improve the health of each patient they treat and also for future generations.

That is what is so amazing that a doctor would take that view.  Because of the ACA, 2.3 million African Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 gained coverage, and the uninsured rate, among African Americans, fell by nearly 7 percent. In the district that I represent, 47,000 more residents now have coverage thanks to the And for the district that I represent, that is pretty significant.
