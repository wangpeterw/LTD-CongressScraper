                          ORONO HOCKEY CHAMPS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Orono 
High School boys hockey team on winning the Minnesota State 
championship, their very first State championship in school history. 
Their win came against Alexandria under the lights in the Xcel Energy 
Center.
  Orono took the lead early in the first, but their advantage was very 
short lived. Alexandria's Cardinals came back to tie it up in very 
little time. Despite outshooting the Cardinals 11 to 1 in the second 
period, Orono just couldn't connect, which made the winning shot, taken 
midway through the third period, all the more exciting.
  Madam Speaker, the student athletes brought home more than just a 
statewide trophy. They set the example for their classmates because of 
their work in the classroom and managing other activities.
  Congratulations again to the coaches, the players, the parents, and 
all of the fans of the Orono High School boys hockey team.
