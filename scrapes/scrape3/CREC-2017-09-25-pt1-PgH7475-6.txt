                     HELEN HUYNH FIGHTING LEUKEMIA

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, last week, people across the Nation and 
around the world heard the heart-wrenching story of my constituent, 
Helen Huynh.
  Helen is bravely fighting leukemia. She desperately needs a stem cell 
transplant, which requires a compatible match. Helen's sister, Thuy, is 
a 100 percent match, but she lives in Vietnam. She has been denied a 
visa to come to the United States for this potentially lifesaving 
procedure. She has been denied now three times.

[[Page H7476]]

  This is outrageous, and I am doing everything I can to make sure this 
wrong is corrected. Mark my words: it will be corrected. I am working 
with Helen's family, the State Department, and the Department of 
Homeland Security to make sure that we are successful in bringing Thuy 
to Helen as soon as possible.
