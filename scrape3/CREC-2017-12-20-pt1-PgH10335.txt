                            THE GOP TAX SCAM

  (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, what a day in Washington, D.C. We have 
many Republicans in this town saying: What a great day it is for the 
American people; what a great Christmas for America.
  The average family--63 percent in America--can't withstand a $500 
emergency. With this tax cut, Apple is going to get $47 billion and 
Donald Trump's family is going to get $1 billion. They are going to 
toss out a few crumbs to working class families who work 60, 70 hours a 
week, and the fat cats in Washington and Wall Street are going to run 
off with the whole pot of gold.
  Whatever happened in this country where we said, To whom much is 
given, much is expected?
  We need to challenge the wealthy corporations. They are sitting on $4 
trillion worth of cash. If they want to start a factory, buy a machine, 
or hire workers, they could do it now. They don't need to take it from 
the middle class.
