                THANKING THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM ALABAMA

  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to note the presence on 
the floor of the junior Senator from Alabama, Mr. Jones, who has been 
waiting patiently. He and I were working together on something that I 
am about to speak about, a resolution that has to do with an event that 
happened 50 years ago, the Memphis sanitation workers strike.
  He has plenty to say about it, but he has not yet made what we call 
his maiden speech on the Senate floor. We usually reserve that moment 
for a singular opportunity to speak. So he is waiting until that time 
to speak. I respect that. I told him the little story of what happened 
to Senator Baker when he was in Senator Jones' position. Baker's 
father-in-law, Senator Dirksen, whom I mentioned, was the leader. 
Everybody assembled to hear Baker's maiden speech. Baker spoke a little 
too long. Dirksen came over to congratulate him. Baker looked up and 
said to his father-in-law, Senator Dirksen: How did I do?
  Dirksen said: Howard, perhaps you should occasionally enjoy the 
luxury of an unexpressed thought.
  So I congratulate Senator Jones on his sticking with tradition here. 
I value the fact that we are working together on civil rights, as well 
as the fact that we will be in Memphis together on the Civil Rights 
Pilgrimage, which he is taking a part in leading early next month. I 
thank him for being on the floor today while I make these remarks.
