                         REMEMBERING JIM VANCE

  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, Jim Vance, our local NBC news anchor in this 
region, who died Saturday at 75, probably set a record, local or 
national, as news anchor.
  For 45 years, while being only himself, Vance presented the news to a 
region that challenged D.C. TV news with vast changes racially and 
ethnically, economically and politically. Jim Vance took the dare and 
told our ever-changing story straight.

  He made us see ourselves, from a city with too much crime to today's 
D.C. with low crime and a big surplus. Only a combination of consummate 
professionalism and enduring affability could have covered so much 
quick-moving news without ever missing a beat.
  Jim Vance brilliantly told our story throughout our first era of home 
rule. These years also encapsulated Jim Vance's service and now join 
his legacy with the District's own history.
