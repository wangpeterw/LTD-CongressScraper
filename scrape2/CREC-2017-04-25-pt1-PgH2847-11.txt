            By Mr. BRAT:
        H.R. 2125.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Congress has explicit and implicit powers to spend, to 
     raise revenue, and to borrow throughout Article I, Section 8 
     of the Constitution. Coherent management of fiscal powers 
     requires a complete assessment of the effects of proposed 
     legislation, so it is both necessary and proper for the 
     estimating agencies to inform Congress of total fiscal 
     impacts.
