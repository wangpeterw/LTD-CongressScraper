As the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations' Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, our Nation's farmers and ranchers will find it hard to access credit during the upcoming planting season. And those recovering from disastrous weather events will not be able to access essential programs in order to help them if we do not finalize a full-year funding agreement right away.  These are just a couple of examples of the hardships that are faced by our citizens here in the U.that depend on this legislation.  As I say, this is the fifth CR for this fiscal year. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle must come to the table willing to negotiate on these budget caps.  As Members know, the House has passed each of the 12 appropriations bills. We have done our job. Of course, the other body continues to be the weakest link in all this, as it needs to seriously reform their process in order to do the work of the people.

429,topic-id,338,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the distinguished Appropriations Committee chairman for yielding me time.  I rise in support of this continuing resolution. Obviously, we would rather fund the government for the entire year before the start of the fiscal year, but that is in a perfect world, and one thing that the Congress has never been accused of is being a perfect world. So we are here dealing in the real world.  To my good friend from Connecticut who just spoke, and she is my good friend, I would point out that the bill before us doesn't cut money from the Prevention It directs money from the Prevention Fund to spend on healthcare programs. In other words, it is taking some discretion from the executive branch and directing that spending that Congress thinks it should be spent for.  One of the programs that we are going to fund for 2 years is the community health centers. Twenty-four million people each year get their healthcare from these community health centers, and one of them is in my home county, the Hope Its main facility is in Waxahachie, But in my hometown of Ennis, we have the Nell Barton Hope Clinic These two facilities in Ellis County this year are providing healthcare for over 10,000 Ellis  This is not exotic care. It is checkups, screenings, mammograms, and all the odds and ends that you have in your basic healthcare facilities. If they need more specific treatment, they are referred to specialists in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  But for the 10,000 citizens of Ellis County who depend on the Hope Clinic for their healthcare, this is a big bill. In fact, the executive director of the Hope Clinic was in my office today, saying: We want to expand, but we don't know if we are going to have the funds. We really need to get some certainty.  That is what this bill is all about. So I rise in strong support, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the CR later this evening.

Mr.Speaker, I support passage of this CR which includes three provisions of mine. It will reauthorize the Community Health Center program, providing $3.6 billion per year for the next 2 years.  Community health centers have a proven track record of providing high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare to approximately 25 million Americans and have long enjoyed bipartisan support because they are a prime example of what is working in our healthcare system.  The CR updates the civil and criminal penalties in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Many haven't been updated in over 20 years.  It also repeals the Medicare therapy cap.

444,topic-id,286,"Mr.Speaker, it is so interesting to listen to this debate. I just want to make three points.  First, on the military funding, I represent Fort When you walk on that post and talk to the men and women in uniform and talk to them about their readiness training, their redeployment training, do you know what they tell us?  They say: Give us certainty in funding.  That is exactly what we are doing, is providing that certainty that they need to defend us, to protect us. They deserve it and they deserve our best efforts. So I find it so curious that there would be opposition to funding our military.  The second point is the community health centers. Many of my colleagues may come from urban areas. I have a rural district. Community health centers are vitally important to my constituents, to Tennesseans who want the access to care and seek the education to know how to take better care of themselves and their families. Let's give them this funding for the 2 years of certainty that is necessary.  Third, legislation that I have authored and worked on is included in the Medicare therapy cap provisions.  Have you ever talked to a senior, as I have, who had a stroke, who is seeking speech therapy or physical therapy from a hip replacement or a fall?  There is an arbitrary cap that runs out and they can no longer seek that medical attention that is necessary for a full and complete recovery and the quality of life that they desire and that they deserve.

492,topic-id,1714,"Mr.President, I am honored to follow my colleagues here today and to be followed by my great friend and colleague, Senator Whitehouse, who has been a wonderful partner in this effort and has helped organize today's colloquy. I will yield to him shortly.  I think the American people are asking a commonsense question: What is the President trying to hide? What do the Russians have on Donald Trump?  The intelligence community unanimously says that the Russians attacked our democracy by interfering in the 2016 election. The only one who has any doubt about it--in fact, the only public official who has the temerity to deny it--is the President of the United So the question is, Why?  That is the elephant in this That is the question that the American people demand that we answer in our investigation into obstruction of justice through the Judiciary Committee and that the special counsel will be answering in his investigation into collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign, as well as subsequent obstruction of justice.  Some of this investigation involves past events and actions by the President and others. But, in fact, what is happening daily in real time is evidence of obstruction of justice. It is as though we were watching a case in court unfolding before our eyes. All we lack is the marshalling of the evidence and the closing argument. In a subsequent speech, I intend to go into great detail on that obstruction case.  From what we know now through the public record, there is a lot more that the special counsel knows from his investigation, and he will be making use of it from classified and unclassified sources.  We now know, irrefutably and undeniably, that there is a credible case of obstruction of justice against the President of the United It is credible and, in many ways, powerful and compelling.  In fact, President Trump has endeavored mightily to stop all of these investigations into the Russian meddling in the 2016 election and his connections to it.  Obstruction of justice is a serious crime, essentially consisting of two elements: 1, to interfere with a lawful investigation and, 2, that interference has to be done with corrupt intent. Corrupt intent means any improper purpose.  It doesn't matter that the President, for example, had the right to fire Jim Comey or to say one thing or another. The question is why he did it. There can be circumstantial evidence of that corrupt intent in what he says and does, as well as direct quotations.  If it was to stop or influence an investigation, that is corrupt intent, and that is enough for obstruction of justice.  My colleagues and I are here today to raise the alarm because where we are now is that part of the President's corrupt intent, as well as his interference with the investigation, consists of an all-out assault on law enforcement and the intelligence community.  In some ways, it is a standard means of defense at trial: When all else fails, attack the prosecution. I have seen it and experienced it as a U.attorney myself in court. So I know it is a last resort, but it has lasting implications for the defendant, or whoever is raising this defense--in this case, the President of the United It has huge, sweeping, enduring, horrific, and reprehensible ramifications. It is irresponsible in a profound constitutional sense for the Commander in Chief to be undermining our national security by attacking the FBI and our intelligence community as institutions.  I wish to remind my colleagues of what our colleague John McCain said.[[Page S644]]My colleague Senator Whitehouse prepared this poster board and will be using it shortly. He said: ``The latest attacks against the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests--no party's, no President's, only Putin's.'' These attacks serve the They do not serve America's national security because they are done with the purpose to obstruct justice.  They are the latest in a series of irresponsible and reprehensible actions that began in the first days of this administration. In January 2017, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates went to the White House to inform White House Counsel Don McGahn that Michael Flynn had lied to the Vice President about his relationship with the Russians and he could, therefore, be subject to blackmail. Don McGahn immediately briefed President Trump, but the White House failed to react in the way that a responsible President would. Soon after it was revealed that the FBI was doing an investigation into Russian meddling, Trump asked FBI Director James Comey for his loyalty. In effect, he asked for a loyalty pledge from the Director of the Federal Bureau of He cornered Comey privately and said that he hoped Comey would let Flynn go, referring to the FBI's investigation into Michael  Trump called Comey and told him he wanted him to lift the cloud of the Russian investigation over his He then called for the firing of Andrew McCabe, a potential corroborating witness for Comey's conversations with  He asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Mike Rogers to publicly state that he was not under investigation. When Comey refused to bend to this pressure, he fired Comey and misstated the reason for that firing. He lied about it, claiming it was because of Comey's supposed handling of the Clinton email investigation, although he later admitted in an interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt that the firing was ``because of this Russia thing,'' and he bragged to Russian officials at the White House that Comey's firing had ``taken off'' the ``great pressure'' of the Russia investigation.  But that did not make the Russia investigation go away, because of the appointment of Special Counsel Robert He berated his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from the special counsel's investigation because he knew Sessions could have stopped it. He berated Jeff Sessions and privately ranted about it.  Those private rants, along with other private conversations--many of them now known to the special counsel, no doubt--are evidence that will be produced by the special counsel.  We know that President Trump wrote a deliberately deceptive statement for his son Donald Trump, Jr., to cover up the Trump Tower meeting and to misstate what the purpose of that meeting was--supposedly Russian adoptions, when, in fact, it was to obtain dirt on Hillary He did it when he knew he was under investigation. That is the key point.  He ordered the firing of Robert Mueller and backed down only when his White House Counsel said he would resign. Again, the reasons that he provided, much like the Comey letter that was a lie, the reasons for his firing the FBI Director were pretextual. He lied about why he wanted Mueller gone, just as he had lied about why he fired Jim  In some ways, others are tasked now, in a switch of tactics. He has no longer threatened to fire the special counsel--at least publicly--but he has tasked his surrogates and sycophants in Congress to attack institutions like the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the intelligence community, along with him. That was the purpose of the Nunes memo--to discredit the FBI and distract from the investigation.  But if he orchestrated the writing of that memo, if he participated in drafting it, if anyone in the White House, with his imprimatur or direction, was involved in crafting that memo, that is evidence also of obstruction of justice, and it will come home to haunt Devin Nunes and the White House staff who participated and others in the Congress who may have been involved, including the staff--all of it because he wants to stop the investigation, all of it because he is afraid of something that the special counsel has and that the Russians may have on him.  The fact of the matter is that no one is above the law. If the President refuses to talk to the special counsel, he should be subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. If he fails to voluntarily appear for that interview with Robert Mueller or his staff, he should be subpoenaed before the grand jury, and he should be forced to testify under threat of contempt. And if he invokes Executive privilege, the outcome will be the same when it is tested in court, as it was in United States v.  We have seen this movie before. We know how it ends because a broad claim of Executive privilege fails in the face of a lawful need for evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation.  If he claims a Fifth Amendment privilege--the right against self-incrimination--it will be a powerful testimony to what he fears the special counsel and the Russians have on him.  We are careening toward a constitutional crisis, and that is why my colleagues in this Chamber can no longer remain silent. It is why Paul Ryan can no longer tolerate Devin Nunes to continue with these frantic antics to protect the President and his ongoing acts of obstruction. It is why I hope we will adopt legislation to protect the special counsel, sending a message to the President of the United States that he cannot obstruct justice by firing the special counsel and precipitate a confrontation that would match the Saturday Night Massacre during the era of That would throw this country into another constitutional conflagration that would be profoundly damaging and enduringly harmful.  This investigation is no hoax or witch hunt. It is real. It is not about any of us or any of the President's tweets. It is about evidence and law. It is about facts and statutes. It is about the elements of a crime that is under investigation. The American people deserve to know the truth, which is why we must have public hearings in the Judiciary Committee, and we must have subpoenas for documents and witnesses. It is why we need to move in the Judiciary Committee with special counsel legislation that will offer protections that guarantee the American people that they will know the truth and that the rule of law will be protected. No one is above the rule of law.  Thank you, Mr. I thank my friend and colleague Senator  I yield the floor.

246,topic-id,1070,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. This rule makes in order two bills reported favorably by the Committee on Financial Services and one bill reported favorably by the Committee on Energy and I just want to take a moment at the beginning to point out that there are no amendments made in order by this rule because there were no amendments offered to any of these bills.  Both of the Financial Services bills were the subject of hearings in the committee last year. Both bills were reported out of committee with bipartisan support of 75 percent or more of the committee members.  The Energy and Commerce bill was reported favorably by the committee with a large bipartisan vote of 39-14.  The rule also provides us with the necessary tools to ensure that we can bring government funding measures to the floor quickly to prevent a government shutdown.  Mr.Speaker, we have three bills before us today. Each of these bills deals with one underlying problem: Washington overregulation. That is it. These are not bills protecting Americans from some foreign hostile force. These are bills protecting Americans from the overreach of their own government.  It is a sad time in which we find ourselves when we must dedicate legislative effort to undoing the harmful effects of the American government on the American people.  Mr.Speaker, in 2013, the CFPB issued its rule commonly referred to as the qualified mortgage rule, or the QM rule. The QM rule requires creditors to make a good faith effort to determine a customer's ability to repay a loan if the loan is secured by a home. However, the rule creates a legal safe harbor from liability under the rule for qualified mortgages.  One aspect of a qualified mortgage is that it cannot have total points and fees exceeding 3 percent of the total loan amount if the loan amount is at least $100,000. However, some fees may be excluded from the points and fees cap if they are reasonable and the lender or any affiliate of the lender receives no compensation from the service.  This all sounds well and good. We certainly don't want predatory lending institutions referring business to themselves just to pad their bottom line at the expense of unsuspecting borrowers.  But this is a great example of how massive, one-size-fits-all Washington regulation often ends up hurting The result of the points and fees cap within the QM rule has been to place low- and moderate-income borrowers in a position where they end up spending more money to secure a loan.  Mr.Speaker, my home State of Colorado has been experiencing explosive population growth over the past decade and longer. Between 2009 and 2016, we added a net increase of more than 600,000 people. But home prices also increased significantly over that time, more than 57 percent.  In 2016, according to The Denver Post, we had the lowest growth we have experienced in many years at only a 30,000-person net increase. In part, the slowing growth rate has to do with rising housing costs. This is why it is vitally important that many first-time homeowners and others have access to affordable loans. Government regulation should not be a part of driving up housing costs.  Why does this happen? Why does a Federal regulation result in hurting the very people it is intended to help?  It is simple: Washington regulators cannot take into account the unique circumstances of each individual This is a crucial difference between the common sense of Americans across this land and the self-importance of some here in D. Many in D.believe firmly that the Federal Government is able to protect every American from every bad experience. They express enormous faith in so-called experts who believe they can effectively govern from afar the lives of  I reject this notion. I reject the belief that a class of enlightened experts and bureaucrats in Washington can better run the lives of individuals. That philosophy deprives Americans of the freedom to make their own choices. When Washington's power expands, individual liberty retreats. So we have to have bills like the ones before us today.  The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill required the CFPB to issue the QM rule. The QM rule was supposed to help low- to moderate-income borrowers save money, but, instead, the QM rule created a situation where low- and moderate-income borrowers cannot take advantage of discounted services offered by their lender.  The rule forces these borrowers to secure these services from third parties which almost always charge more than the lenders would charge for the same services. The negative impact of this rule is so abundantly clear that half of the committee's Democrats voted with all of the Republicans in support of fixing this provision of Dodd- Passing this bill will not magically cause housing in Colorado to become more affordable, but it will eliminate an unnecessary regulation that needlessly drives up borrowing costs.  Mr.Speaker, in addition to rolling back Dodd-Frank regulations, the second Financial Services bill that we have before us today protects the ability of small banks to issue debt and raise capital.  The Federal Reserve generally discourages bank holding companies from using debt to finance acquisitions, particularly the purchasing of banks. However, the Federal Reserve carved out certain small bank holding companies.  In order to be considered a small bank holding company, these companies had an asset cap of $150 million. By 2015, the cap had been increased to $1 billion. The bill before us today increases the cap to $3 billion.  As we have heard last night during testimony at the Rules Committee, there is no science or data behind the level of the cap. Think about that for a second. The government has established a cap that has a negative impact on our community banks, and the cap has no basis in anything, not science, not data, not historical financial patterns, nothing. The cap is simply a whim of  Mr.Speaker, this is absurd. It is time we allow our community banks to have an avenue to continue being locally owned and based in our communities rather than being bought out by Wall  Today we have two Financial Services bills before us that reduce regulations and allow Coloradans and all Americans greater freedom in the choice of banking services. I urge support of these two bills.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgH790-4.txt,2233,ADJOURNMENT,2018.0,6.0,February

252,topic-id,544,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to turn now to the final bill made in order under this rule, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure  Mr.Speaker, in 2016, I had the privilege to visit with one of my constituents, Lamont Lamont owns a Papa John's pizza franchise and invited me to come to his restaurant. He even taught me how to throw, or how to toss--maybe throw, maybe toss--a pizza. It was a great experience. I got to meet members of his team and hear about their professional goals. I am happy to say that the American Dream is alive within the hearts of the people of  However, my visit with Lamont was not without concern. You see, recently, Washington had decided to push a hugely disruptive regulation on our food service industry.  In the interest of ensuring Americans had information on their food choices, Washington crafted a one-size-fits-all mandate that every menu item be labeled with its nutritional content.  As someone who has become extremely aware of the quality of foods that I consume, I certainly understand the do-good intentions behind this kind of regulation. But the impact on businesses like Lamont's has been substantial. In fact, some businesses have no realistic way of complying with the rules.  Further, the law that put these regulations in place, ObamaCare, placed criminal penalties on those who fail to comply. How ridiculous is that? If you mislabel or fail to properly label the calorie count on a menu item, you could be fined and go to jail.  The bill before us today rectifies some of the harm done by this rule. The bill allows multiple avenues for businesses such as Lamont's pizza restaurant to comply with menu labeling requirements in the most cost-effective manner possible.  While I don't believe the Federal Government needs to require the calorie count of a food item on a menu in Colorado, this bill offers a compromise. Americans will still have access to nutrition information about the food they are purchasing, while businesses will be able to provide a variety of prepared and local foods without fear of major penalties if one serving happens to be slightly different in its calorie count than the last serving.                              {time}  1045  Mr.Speaker, I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to visit with Coloradans who are working hard to build their businesses, provide for their families and community, and employ people, only to be met with the constant headwind that our Federal Government blows in their faces through its Washington-knows-best regulatory schemes.

I think often of Coloradans like It is men and women like him all across this great land that are doing the important work.

Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     4938) to address the opioid epidemic, and for other purposes.      The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All      points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.

Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.4938.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

332,topic-id,743,"Mr.Speaker, we are here today considering a continuing resolution that will provide dollars for the Federal Government and our national defense, but it also will finally accomplish reauthorization of funding for several important healthcare programs. These extensions are long overdue, and I urge Members to support this legislation so that our Nation's healthcare providers will have stability to continue their normal operations.  The House passed many of these provisions last That is when we passed the Championing Healthy Kids However, since House passage, the legislation has been stalled without action in the Fortunately, the Children's Health Insurance Program was reauthorized in the last continuing resolution. It seems like a long time ago, but it was only 3 weeks ago. However, we did not complete the public health or Medicare extenders. The continuing resolution that we are debating today includes funding for other important healthcare programs, such as community health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education, all of which expired at the end of                              {time}  1530  The continuing resolution provides a 2-year extension of funding for federally qualified health centers. One in 13 individuals nationwide relies upon a community health center to receive necessary healthcare services. The Community Health Center Fund plays an important role in supplementing the services that the federally qualified health centers are able to deliver to underserved communities by providing care to all Americans, regardless of their income or their ability to pay.  The legislation we are considering also includes a 2-year extension of other important public health programs, including funding for the National Health Service Corps, the Family-to-Family Information Centers, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, the Special Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes, and the Special Diabetes Program for American  The package also delays the $5 billion in cuts to many hospitals in many of our districts across the country from the Affordable Care Act-mandated Medicaid disproportionate share hospital reductions for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. I am certain that other Members have heard from their hospitals, as have I; hospitals in our districts whose ability to remain open and operational and continue to provide care could be jeopardized by these cuts in the so-called DSH payments.  This delays but does not fix a problem that ObamaCare created for safety net hospitals that provide care to citizens of our country who most need this care. The committee is committed to continuing to work on this, but this 2-year extension is important.  The bill also includes important Medicare extenders. The extension of the ground ambulance services and cost reporting requirements will allow our emergency responders in urban, rural, and superrural areas another 5 years of certainty in receiving their add-on payments.  Similarly, home health providers will receive a 5-year extension of their rural add-on Medicare payments, and certain low-volume hospitals will continue to receive the payment adjustment for an additional 2 years.  This health extenders package permanently repeals a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This provision sought to cap Medicare-covered outpatient therapy services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology. The cap was never fully put into effect, but repealing the therapy caps will allow for certainty and stability for Medicare beneficiaries and providers of these services. Many of us have heard about the importance of repealing the cap.  One of my priorities as chairman of the Health Subcommittee has been to improve the value of our electronic health records for doctors and for patients. Electronic health records have promise to streamline the sharing of data amongst patients and their doctors, but they have not yet fully lived up to this promise.  Adoption of electronic health records is growing, but the meaningful use program, as established in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, has burdened providers with stringent requirements. In an effort to reduce that burden, this bill we are considering today removes the mandate that the Secretary of Health and Human Services make the meaningful use standards more stringent over time.  I believe we have squeezed all the blood we can out of this turnip, and it is time to let our doctors be doctors. This will permit the Department to evaluate in other ways.  Lastly, this package contains important provisions that aim to improve care for individuals suffering from chronic diseases. The Senate has already passed these provisions in their CHRONIC Care  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

This program is currently in its fifth year and has been found to save Medicare dollars, but Medicare needs more time to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the program.  This health extenders package has responsible offsets. One of these offsets would allow for Medicare reimbursement of outpatient physical therapy or occupational therapy services provided by a therapy assistant. These providers are reimbursed at 85 percent of the physician rate, and therapy assistants must have a State license and abide by Medicare supervision requirements.  Additionally, lottery winnings and other lump sum income of over $80,000 would count toward income eligibility under Medicaid's modified adjusted gross income rules. In certain cases, individuals could remain eligible if being ineligible would lead to undue medical or financial hardship.

Prior to coming to Congress, I worked for 30 years as a labor and employment attorney in I advised clients on how to prevent sexual harassment and how to navigate the process if a harassment claim was made. Quite frankly, I was shocked to see how complicated the congressional process for handling sexual harassment and other employment law claims was.

Fourth, the related resolution paves the way for every congressional office to have a clearly defined antiharassment and antidiscrimination policy. This reform alone will result in greater awareness.  Fifth, the resolution prohibits Members of Congress from engaging in a sexual relationship with any staff member under their supervision and makes clear that sexual harassment is a violation of the Code of Official Conduct and will not be tolerated.

470,topic-id,1559,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to speak against the Trump administration's egregious attack on our pristine coastlines in the Pacific, the Atlantic, Alaska, and the eastern Gulf of  Dramatic increases in oil and gas development offshore pose a direct threat to our coastal economies in the United States, particularly in the Pacific I know many of my colleagues are going to join me on the floor this afternoon to talk about this and about the specific impacts in their areas.  The draft leasing plan, which is what has been put forth by the Secretary of the Interior, is an unprecedented attempt to allow offshore oil and gas drilling in over 90 percent of the U.Outer Continental Shelf, including in Washington and  The truth is that instead of creating new jobs in the oil and gas sector, the administration is poised to choose big oil jobs over the ocean-dependent industries like fishing, shipbuilding, and tourism on our coasts. I know this because I just traveled to many of our coastal communities in the State of Washington, which make their livelihoods off of fishing or tourism, that are very concerned by this proposal. And just yesterday, a public hearing was supposed to take place in Tacoma, WA, which was canceled. The Trump administration failed to account for the value of the existing robust coastal and ocean economies that could be jeopardized by expanding offshore drilling in those areas.  Our ocean-related economy is so important to our State that expanding drilling directly threatens the ocean environment and marine resources that support millions of jobs in construction, fishing, shipbuilding, tourism, recreation, and maritime transport. The ocean-related industries in the areas targeted by the administration's plan contribute over 2.2 million direct jobs, nearly $75 billion in wages, and over $150 billion in The reason I bring this up is that the economic benefits of these industries cannot be overstated: nearly $8 billion from fishing and seafood, nearly $70 billion from marine transport, and over $125 billion from tourism and recreation.  We know that oilspills or other natural disasters related to oil and gas activities, such as the Exxon Valdez or the Deepwater Horizon disaster, can disrupt entire coastal economies. For example, if you took just the Deepwater Horizon spill in size and compared it to the coastal areas of Washington and Oregon, the impacted area would cover all of Washington and a big chunk of We know that these can be devastating.  The shore-adjacent counties in the targeted areas host over 39 million jobs and contribute over $2 trillion in wages. The economies of the shore-adjacent counties represent 65 percent of the affected coastal States' That is just one way of saying that coastal States and their economies are big drivers in our U.economy and that they are extremely dependent on clean water, coasts, our oceans, and our fisheries.  The Washington coast economy relies on healthy, sustainable oceans, which support our fisheries in places such as Grays Harbor and Pacific County and in many other parts of our State, to make sure they have seafood processing, recreation, and tourism. Our Washington maritime economy is worth $50 billion in economic activity and 191,000 jobs, and tourism on the coast adds jobs for anglers, charter boats, cruise guides, restaurants, hotels, and more, which are so iconic in the Pacific They are the culture and heritage of our coastal communities.  The fact that so many recreational fishermen can be out on our healthy oceans and attracting more people to come and explore is so much a part of the Northwest that putting it at risk to oilspill activities or activities related to exploration is just not something these communities want to do. Just this past week, I received resolutions from various communities on our Pacific coast that urged that this idea be turned down.  The Washington and Oregon coasts are not really suited for oil and gas development. First of all, there are extreme sea states, treacherous storms, and the remote nature of our coastlines. As one of our maritime communities told me, it doesn't really have the resources for cleanup in the area. If a spill happened, who would be there to clean it up? In the meantime, our fishermen, if they have oil sheens behind their fishing boats, can be fined. If we are ready to fine fishermen for oil sheens behind their boats, why are we proposing a plan in the treacherous waters of the Pacific Northwest without having any idea who is going to clean up the mess?  Adding to the risk in the Pacific Northwest is the Cascadia Subduction Zone--one of the most dangerous faults in the United The Cascadia Subduction Zone is long overdue to create a significant earthquake. You hear from lots of people about this. In fact, after The New Yorker wrote a big story called ``The Really Big One,'' many people from across the country emailed me to ask: Are we ready for this to happen? I can tell you, with what happened in Japan, people are very concerned about how we prepare for that in the Pacific So it makes no sense to put an oil rig on one of the most high-risk, earthquake-prone zones in the United  In a 1991 spill, the dangerous and choppy seas prevented first responders from being able to contain more of the spill. That is why I have fought to improve oilspill prevention and response in the State of Washington by deploying our Neah Bay tug, which is a full-time tug, to make sure we get boats safely through our waters; by increasing oilspill response equipment throughout the Strait of Juan de Fuca; and by pushing for the Coast Guard to invest in research on tar sands oil.  Those are some of the things we can do to protect ourselves, but we need to do much more.  We must weigh future decisions about where we should allow oil and gas exploration with the costs to our coastal economies.  We must incorporate the lessons we have learned from disasters such as Deepwater Horizon, which is part of this picture, or the Exxon Valdez in order to improve oilspill prevention, response, and safety. Herring fish from Prince William Sound are still very much impacted and have not fully recovered after the Exxon So telling our fishermen that this is a great idea, that Washington fisheries, whether they be crab or other fisheries, should be susceptible to these kinds of spills--that is just not something our fishermen want to hear.  In addition to these efforts to drill off of our coasts--efforts that have been repeatedly blocked in the past--President Trump wants to roll back important safety regulations that were put in place after Deepwater Horizon, such as blowout preventer systems, well control, and production safety systems.  Now Secretary Zinke wants to open these coastal areas. Our State has been responding to his proposal for months and months. We gave very important data to say that this was not a good idea off the coast of It is interesting because Secretary Zinke made a last-minute decision with regard to Florida, which didn't turn in its information about its State on this issue. Then later, after a visit with the Governor, Secretary Zinke said that this was something he didn't want to see happen. The people of Washington don't want political games played. They want to have their say on this issue, and they want to make sure their voices are heard loud and clear. Our coastal economies are too important to us, from a jobs and cultural perspective, to go about even proposing the research on drilling in our coastal areas.  I am disappointed that yesterday there was a last-minute postponement of a public meeting that was supposed to take place in Tacoma, WA, to hear from our citizens about their opposition to expanding oil drilling off our coasts. I am not sure whether there will be a hearing rescheduled or exactly what was behind the cancelation, but it was one of the first opportunities Washingtonians could have had to express their views on this issue.[[Page S632]]  Based on the vocal opposition of our communities, I sent a letter to Secretary Zinke, with 15 of my House and Senate colleagues from the Pacific Northwest, calling on Washington and Oregon to not be part of a future lease program. I know that many people, including our Governor, have done the same. Members from the Pacific, Atlantic, gulf coast, and even Alaska are writing to Secretary Zinke, asking him to exclude their areas from future drilling activities.  I am very concerned that we are wasting taxpayer money in reanalyzing what we have analyzed before--that oil and gas development in the Pacific Northwest does not make sense for our coastal communities. We will fight to protect our fishing jobs, our tourism, our recreation, and all of the things that are part of the center of our culture on our coasts. We hope Secretary Zinke will follow science, protect our coastal economy, stop this foolish idea that drilling off of our coast is either necessary or prudent, and move about to protect our Federal lands.

551,topic-id,469,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for yielding me this time, and I also want to thank her so much for her diligence, her efforts, and her sincerity in trying to make this issue and this bill, and many bills on this issue, as good as possible.  Although we may disagree on the final version of this bill, again, it is my sincere wish that we will continue to work together as this issue will never go away because nutrition and the understanding of that for every American is paramount for our individual health and for communities as a whole.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.772, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2017. I am proud to colead this bill with my colleague, Congresswoman McMorris Americans increasingly realize the importance of having access to accurate nutritional information about the food we eat, and we need to make sure that businesses are providing this information.  However, no two food establishments, convenience stores, or grocery stores are identical, and the government[[Page H820]]should take that into account as we implement guidelines on making nutritional information available.  As a former small-business owner myself, I know the costs and challenges associated with regulatory compliance. Not all businesses can afford a legal department to help them stay within the rules, despite their best intentions. This legislation would help businesses help consumers be smart about what they are eating.  The FDA's 2014 rule on nutrition disclosures is set to take effect in May of this year, though some issues remain unresolved. This bill will give FDA the authority to fix these issues and hold businesses to tough standards they can and shall meet.  Right now, the FDA rule exempts small businesses, but not those that sell to large suppliers. Those small businesses would have to undertake expensive nutritional analysis in order to comply with the law, even if they don't have the resources.  Another example is, right now, the FDA rule would require delivery restaurants to post nutritional information in their brick-and-mortar establishment instead of online, even though nobody would see it, especially those who go online to order their food. This bill fixes that.  Finally, this bill reins in out-of-proportion penalties in the current rule that would have severe, unintended consequences. No one should have to worry about losing their business if they mistakenly make sandwiches with too much meat or cheese.  Importantly, this bill makes sure the FDA is still able to enforce the law in situations in which businesses are misleading their customers. This bill doesn't include a time delay, meaning the FDA would be able to implement the nutrition disclosure rules sooner than later.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to help the businesses in districts like mine to help our constituents eat healthier.

486,topic-id,1122,"Mr.President, first, I thank Senator Whitehouse for bringing this issue to the attention of our colleagues and the American people. As Senator Whitehouse points out, we have seen from the White House, from the President, an effort to try to undermine the credibility of the independent investigation being done by the Department of Justice under Mr.These are very serious issues, and I hope every Member of this Chamber will support the independence of that investigation and speak loudly against any interference, wherever it may come from.  Then, Senator Whitehouse has brought up the second issue; that is, Mr.Putin has been extremely active in regard to activities against U.interests. I appreciate Senator Whitehouse referencing a report that was released on January 10 of this year. It was as a result of a full year's operation by the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to document Mr.Putin's reckless assault against democratic institutions, universal values, and the rule of law--the asymmetric arsenal he uses to accomplish that attack against democratic institutions, which includes cyber attacks, disinformation, support for fringe political groups, weaponization of energy resources, organized crime, corruption, and, yes, military aggression. He has used every one of those tools to compromise democratic institutions in Europe and, yes, in the United  Mr.Putin was extremely active in the 2016 election. That has now been verified without any question. A report I authored goes through 19 European countries in which Mr.Putin has been active against democratic institutions.  I share with my colleagues that the President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly was in town today. He is meeting with government officials. He knows firsthand Mr.Putin's aggression because there are Russian troops in Georgia today affecting its sovereignty, as there are Russian troops in Moldova, as there are Russian troops in The people of Montenegro saw the hand of Mr.Putin when he held a coup against their authority. The people of the United Kingdom saw Mr.Putin's efforts as he got involved in the Brexit referendum. The people of France and Germany saw Mr.Putin's aggression as he tried to interfere with their free elections.  Countries have stepped up. They said: Enough is enough. We have seen, with strong leadership, that you can counter the activities successfully of what Russia is trying to do. The right mixture of political will, of defense and deterrence can work, and, yes, as Senator Whitehouse pointed out, we in Congress acted. We recognized the threat of We passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, the CAATS It was a bipartisan effort that tightened some of the sanctions under the Obama-era Executive order on Ukraine and passed new mandatory sanctions against Russia because of its activities.  There were sanctions imposed in regard to the Russian Federation's undermining cybersecurity. There were sanctions related to Russia's crude oil products. There were sanctions authorized with respect to Russian and other foreign financial institutions. There were sanctions imposed against Russia for significant corruption in the Russian There were sanctions with respect to certain transactions with foreign sanctions evaders and serious human rights abusers in the Russian There were mandatory sanctions with respect to persons who engaged in transactions with the intelligence and defense sectors of the Government of the Russian  Why? Because they were interfering in our elections.  There were sanctions with respect to investment in or in the facilitation of the privatization of state-owned assets by the Russian  Why? Because that helped finance Mr.Putin's activities.  There were sanctions with respect to the transfer of arms and related materiel to  Each one of those sanctions gave new authority to the President of the United States to impose sanctions against Russia for its activities.  I said earlier that, where countries have shown leadership, it has been effective in countering Mr.Putin's activities. With President Trump, there have been no sanctions. Not one has been brought forward under the law passed by the Congress of the United By 98, 99 percent, the House and Senate approved the sanctions. The Trump administration has imposed zero.  Mr.Trump has failed to acknowledge that Mr.Putin has even been engaged in our 2016 elections. He said: I talked to Mr.He seemed like he was telling me the truth when he said he wasn't involved--even though it was the unanimous view of our intelligence community and the facts had very clearly been laid out to the American people that Mr.Putin had been actively engaged in the 2016 elections.  Yes, we have seen, very recently, Russia's engagement in the Czech election. We have seen this movie before where the candidate, in his advocating for stronger ties to European institutions, is targeted by a barrage of fake news stories that spreads across online platforms, which he alleges have been directed by Russian security services[[Page S640]]and entities tied to them--a direct assault against the Czech Republic's democratic institutions.  As Senator Whitehouse pointed out, when asked in an interview if Russia would try to influence the midterm elections of the United States, our CIA Director, Michael Pompeo, replied: ``Of course. I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that.''  So where is the Trump administration in its taking action to protect our democratic institutions?  This is not a partisan issue. There is a long tradition of Republicans and Democrats working together in Congress to counter Russian Government aggression abroad and abuse against its own citizens, our allies, and democratic institutions. The sanctions bill that passed in 2017 had near-unanimous support. It was crafted and developed by Democrats and Republicans who worked together.  The strength and durability of our political system relies on such bipartisan solutions to our national security challenges. There is a series of recommendations that were in the report I referred to earlier, those of working with our allies to develop cybersecurity issues, to working with NATO to understand what the article V response should be to cyber attacks, to finding alternative ways to stop Russia from using energy as a weapon. It starts with Presidential leadership.  We must take care to point out that there is a distinction between Mr.Putin's corrupt regime and the people of Russia, who have been some of his most frequent and long-suffering victims. Many Russian citizens, like Sergei Magnitsky, strive for a transparent, accountable government that operates under the democratic rule of law, and we hope for better relations in the future with a Russian Government that reflects these imperatives.  In the meantime, the United States must work with our allies to build defenses against Mr.Putin's asymmetric arsenal and strengthen our international norms and values to deter such behavior by Russia or any other country.

472,topic-id,1027,"Mr.President, today I rise to address an issue that probably is not of great concern to the citizens of Arizona, but, certainly, it is of a lot of concern for people who happen to live on the east coast and the west coast of our  I join my colleagues on both coasts in opposition to the Trump administration's recent proposal to open up parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico to more oil and gas drilling. For a long time, I have advocated for an ``all of the above'' strategy to meet our country's energy needs, as we move our country toward greater energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy and to energy independence. In my view, the administration's recent proposal to expand drilling off of our coasts into new areas is not necessary at this time. It is unnecessary at this time.  Just 8 years ago, we saw very clearly with the Deepwater Horizon disaster that oilspills do not respect State boundaries and that severe environmental and financial costs of oilspills last, in some cases, not just for years or decades but for generations. A spill anywhere along the east coast could easily affect the pristine beaches of Delaware and the vibrant coastal communities that rely on fishing, tourism, and recreational activities to drive their local economy.  Delaware's coast isn't all that long. It is about 25, 30 miles, from the Maryland line to just north of Lewes, Each year, Delaware's coasts generate almost $7 billion. Our beach communities in places like Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, and surrounding areas support nearly 60,000 jobs in a little State with not quite 1 million people. It supports $711 million in tax revenues. Again, the State budget is right around $4 billion. Delaware may be a small State--I like to say we are the 49th largest State--but we have a lot of coast-related activities, and they are a big business for a little State, providing more than 10 percent of the First State's total employment, taxes, and business production. Jeopardizing the environmental and economic health of the entire Atlantic coast is the wrong move, and we simply think it is not worth the risk.  You don't just have to take my word for it. Experts, scientists, and residents living in communities along the coast that will be most impacted by this decision agree, especially since the threat of climate change continues to grow.  Delawareans are similarly concerned about the dangers posed by oil and gas exploration activities, including the use of seismic-testing air guns to search for offshore oil and gas deposits. In August 2016, roughly 18 months ago, over 40 State and local elected officials in Delaware sent a letter to the Department of Interior--this was in the last administration--expressing their opposition to proposed seismic surveys.  Their concerns, in my view, are well-founded. The negative impact of the oil and gas industry's seismic testing on ocean ecosystems and the life they support--from plankton at the base of the ocean food chain and all the way to whales at the top--is well documented. Despite the widespread opposition and proof of harmful consequences, proponents of increased drilling for oil would argue that oil and gas development could represent economic benefit in selected areas along our coast. But these areas are already the beneficiary of remarkable economic benefits derived from and contingent on a healthy, vital, and sustainable ocean environment off of our shores. As a result, these communities do not take the prospect of compromising these natural resources lightly, nor should we.  Do you know who also recognizes that coastal communities could be negatively impacted if their natural resources were compromised? The answer is our Interior Secretary, Mr.Ryan In fact, that was the exact justification that Secretary Zinke used to carve Florida's gulf coast out of the Trump administration's proposal. Secretary Zinke pointed out that other States--like Louisiana, for example--are ``working coasts'' that are ``very much different than a recreation-centric coast that's in Florida.''  It seems to me that maybe, just maybe, the only real difference between Florida and every other coastal State--including Delaware and up on north to Maine--that was not lucky enough to get an exemption from Secretary Zinke is that President Trump happens to have beach-front property in Believe me, I understand that a potential oilspill off of the Florida coast would be bad for business at Mar-a-Lago and that the President's guests probably don't want the view from the resort obstructed by offshore oil rigs. I understand that because an overwhelming majority of Delawareans feel the same way, and their voices deserve to be heard too.  It is not just the Delawareans or even Democrats who acknowledge that increased oil drilling off of our coasts is the wrong move. Republican Governors and lawmakers from States such as Georgia and South Carolina--and all the way up to Massachusetts and New Hampshire--have publicly stated their opposition to the Trump administration's plan because the risks are simply not worth the potential reward.  If the administration insists on proceeding with this proposal, then, it should carve out the cherished Delaware coast and similar areas along the Atlantic from any efforts to increase drilling. As we have heard said many times, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. In Florida, Secretary Zinke has clearly established the standard that should apply to any coastal area that would be part of an offshore leasing plan. If it is an area in which coastal activities and industries yield greater economic value and where local communities are solidly opposed, then those areas should get the same exemption that has been awarded to the Sunshine State of  This President is a businessman, and the numbers are clear. Increased drilling does not make economic sense. I urge President Trump to rethink this shortsighted proposal and to side with coastal residents from Maine to  Mr.President, I yield back.

I also thank all of my colleagues on the committee and all of those who have participated in this process on this bill and this resolution.  I rise in support of both the bill and the resolution.  We know sexual harassment is about power--a misuse of power that impacts careers, lives, and self-esteem. We know most women do not come forward and disclose sexual harassment. We know, often, they leave their desired careers because of that.  We have seen it in all industries: predators such as Harvey Weinstein in Hollywood; Matt Lauer, Roger Ailes, Charlie Rose in the media; John Conyers and Trent Franks in our own body.  So it is so important that this legislation, this historic step, is fundamentally changing that balance of power by creating an office for the victims, the Office of Employee This is the single most important thing in this legislation to restore that balance of power that has been misused by those in power.  When I spoke to Dorena Bertussi, who, 30 years ago, was sexually harassed in this body by Congressman Jim Bates from California, she didn't have an office to go to. She didn't even have one that wasn't very good. So now, 30 years later, we are writing this.  We now have transparency. People can't hide behind the process anymore. The Members' names will be known. Taxpayers will not be on the hook for any of this. The offender themselves will have to pay. We have all types of methods in here to get that money because we want to make sure the victim is made whole.  I appreciate we have also adopted some of the DeSantis provisions to get a full accounting of past cases so we know the amounts and we know exactly what happened. And I am still concerned about those Members who may have used their MRAs, their Member allowances, in an inappropriate way. That is corrected in this bill and is no longer allowed.  Also, we have made it clear that there are no relationships with subordinates. I do want to mention that I still do believe, despite--this is a great bill and I heartily support it and so appreciate all the hard work that the staff and everyone has done, but I still do believe we need to disclose the past names that are still unknown. Some of those names have come forward because of the press, because of victims speaking out.  We need to let the victims know that they can speak out from the past. If they want to speak out, they can; that this body is not going to be using any of our resources to stop a victim from the past from speaking out.  I also do think we still need to disclose all of those names going forward so that we have full accountability, because part of that misuse of power is that they can continue to know they won't be held accountable, and the victims see that. So we need to have a strong message that there is nobody in this body that would ever be allowed to go forward without being held accountable.

132,topic-id,1129,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to join my colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, in raising the alarm about a decision I believe represents politicized policymaking at its very worst. Just a few weeks ago, we were notified that the Trump administration's Interior Department seeks to open up 90 percent--90 percent--of America's waters to oil and gas drilling.  This was startling news for Americans everywhere but particularly for those of us who come from States along the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines who had no expectation that our coastal waters were about to be subjected to the search for oil and gas. The objections to the Trump administration's decision came swiftly from elected officials in both parties, Republicans and Democrats, because protecting America's fragile coastlines isn't--or shouldn't be--a partisan issue.  This decision by President Trump and Secretary of the Interior Zinke was not rooted in public input or scientific analysis. This decision was not based on concerns about community safety or economic prosperity. This decision was our administration putting their ``energy dominance'' goals above all else.  I know several of my colleagues have already spoken out to discuss what this means for their States and how it will impact their constituents, but I am here today to raise my voice for mine, to fight for In Delaware, our coasts are critical to our local environment and our robust economy. Delaware has 28 miles of Atlantic coastline--some of the most pristine, most beautiful beaches in the entire country.  As you can see in this graphic of our boardwalk at Rehoboth Beach, DE, our 28 miles of coastline employ 10 percent of our total State workforce. That is a remarkable amount of economic activity in a very small space. Our coastline generates $6.9 billion in economic activity every year and hosts thousands of acres of protected land. It includes on our bay shore side two national wildlife refuges that serve as critical[[Page S628]]habitat for bald eagles, white-tailed deer, and striped bass. The future of our coastal economy depends on recreational access, fishing, and tourism, which are now potentially at risk because of this ill-advised decision to open the coastline off of Delaware and the rest of the mid-Atlantic to potential oil and gas exploration and production.  My colleagues know that I make an effort to promote pragmatic and bipartisan ideas. It is one of my top priorities, day in and day out, to work across the aisle and do what is right for our constituents and for the United  Let me be clear. My view is not based on an anti-oil or anti-natural gas message. I support an ``all of the above'' energy strategy and have advanced legislation that will embrace an ``all of the above'' energy strategy, and I acknowledge there are many places in the United States where we can, and do, safely produce these resources, both onshore and offshore. But what if we happen to face a spill of the scale and size of Deepwater Horizon?  This is an overlay of the footprint of the 2010 oil disaster of the Deepwater Horizon and how it spread to impact the gulf coastline. It is perhaps a little hard to see here, but the State of Delaware and New Jersey and its fragile coastline are underneath that footprint. It suggests how we might end up facing dramatic impacts, negative impacts on tourism and fishing that depend on clean coastlines to support tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity in my home  If we are going to think seriously about doing this, we need to think about the impacts. We need to ask whether the costs outweigh the benefits. When it comes to the Trump-Zinke plan to drill off the coast of Delaware, I am here to tell you that the potential costs dramatically outweigh the benefits. As you can see in this graphic, a spill the size of the Deepwater Horizon could devastate all of our beach communities and protected wildlife areas in Delaware and the region.  Again, protecting our coastlines, an idea supported by scientists and coastal residents alike, should not be a partisan issue. In Delaware alone, multiple city councils, all up and down our coast, have openly opposed offshore drilling through letters and resolutions they have sent to me and the rest of our congressional delegation.  Coastal lawmakers from both parties have opposed offshore drilling. I know for a fact the same is happening in virtually every other coastal State potentially impacted by this unwise decision. These are the people we should be listening to--the people who don't just visit the coast for a week in the summer but who live on it, who rely on it, who have built their lives and their local economy around it.  Instead, as this decision shows, the Trump administration is prioritizing the oil and gas industry and partisan politics over those of independent scientists, coastal residents, and the elected officials who speak for our coastal communities. That was made painfully clear when the Republican Governor of Florida, a close ally of the President, petitioned to shield just Florida from potential oil and gas exploration and production.  Sure enough, Florida promptly got a public promise from Secretary Zinke that its coastlines would be spared. I am sure Florida's coastline is beautiful. In fact, I visited Florida's coastline, and I can tell you it is beautiful. But guess what; so is Delaware's. We deserve to be able to protect our coastline just as much as Floridians do. I invite Secretary Zinke to once again come to Delaware but to instead see the coastline and see these fragile resources and see what they have to offer for wildlife, for conservation, for fishing, for hunting, and for tourism.  Secretary Zinke promising to exempt Florida is the Trump administration deciding which States have to deal with oil and gas drilling based purely on partisan, political considerations. I think the state of our coastal communities and local economies shouldn't be auctioned off to the highest bidder and shouldn't be subject to partisan politics. Instead, they should be protected based on science and based on the views of coastal communities.  I am here today to voice my profound disappointment in this blatant neglect of local voices and the well-being of individual States and coastal communities. I came to the floor to fight for my State and to raise the local voices I have heard from our coastal communities. Our coastlines are just too fragile and too vital and too important to let partisan politics get in the way of their future.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

8,topic-id,799,"Mr.President, I spoke yesterday about the deadline we have coming up in 2 days. The question is, Are we going to fund the Federal Government? Are we going to keep the lights on, the parks open, the military protecting us, the Border Patrol protecting our borders, or are we going to shut down the government again over an unrelated issue?  I listened to my friend, the Senator from Illinois, talk at some length about I do want to respond to that, but there is no reason we have to do DACA first, because we are engaged in good-faith negotiations, and, indeed, the majority leader has promised that he would take up a bill on the floor of the Senate in our failing to reach an agreement.  The fact is that our friends across the aisle have, basically, shut down the government and are now threatening to hold hostage a number of very important measures, which I will talk about momentarily, over this issue that is unrelated to the funding of the government or to these other matters.  So what have we had to do?  We have had to pass short-term continuing resolutions. We have had five of them since September alone. The impact of these continuing resolutions was brought home to me again yesterday.  Usually, I would think about our military and General Mattis, who has pleaded with us to help provide the additional resources that are necessary to make sure that our military is ready, is trained, has the equipment it needs in order to fight and win wars but, hopefully, to maintain our strength so that we will never have to fight a war. That is how Ronald Reagan viewed it. I agree with General Mattis: Peace through strength is the right formula.  Yet, when our adversaries look at us with our military--just a pale reflection of what it used to be in terms of readiness because of the lack of funding we have provided--that is a provocation or, at least, an invitation for others to step in and fill the void, and it leads to a more dangerous world.  As I said, the harm caused by these continuing resolutions was brought home to me again yesterday when I had a number of people with the Texas Association of Community Health Centers come visit. These community health centers are a vital link and safety net for many Texans and many Americans who don't otherwise have a place they can go for their medical care. They treat people based on a sliding scale, based on the ability to pay, so they are accessible to virtually everyone.  What my constituents with the Texas Association of Community Health Centers told me was because of the funding cliff with the continuing resolutions, they don't know how to plan. Their doctors, their medical assistants, and other support staff don't know if they are going to have a job after Thursday, February 8, when the current continuing resolution expires.  They don't know whether the patients they treat will actually have a place to go to get that treatment. This is a miserable way for Congress to do business, and it should not continue. We need to provide more certainty and predictability.  General Mattis himself said that this basically wastes money because we have to plan to shut down portions of our activities if, in fact, government does shut down. So then we have to restart it again--stop it, start it. It is a waste, it is inefficient, and it is unnecessary.  Our friends across the aisle need to release another hostage, too, in addition to the spending caps agreement and the funding needed for our military and the funding needed for community health centers and all the other important functions that are served by the Federal They need to release the hostage of disaster relief.  In December, the House passed an $81 billion relief package, but so far our Democratic colleagues have refused to allow us to bring that disaster relief bill up. Again, why? Because of DACA, this unrelated immigration issue that they think is more important than all the people who were hurt by Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Harvey, and the wildfires out  We do need to address DACA, and we will, but why hurt the victims of these natural disasters in the interim by holding this disaster relief hostage? It is time we stand up in a bipartisan fashion and show these folks in Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and out West that we remember, and we are going to help them. Why should they have to wait any further? There is no good answer to that question, but I think it is important that somebody come out on the floor of the U.Senate and ask the question.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS622.txt,1692,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1892, HONORING",2018.0,6.0,February
366,topic-id,2756,"Mr.President, I said I wanted to talk about the issue our Democratic colleagues shut down the government over last month, and that issue is immigration and the path forward on DACA, again, is Deferred Action on Childhood This is something President Obama did unilaterally, circumventing Congress, assuring that in a new administration, it would be called into question, not only in the courts but also by the new administration.  President Trump, recognizing that the courts had effectively said what President Obama tried to do was illegal, basically continued it for a time to give Congress a chance to try to respond, and he has given us a deadline of March 5. I heard my friend from Illinois blame President Trump for trying to fix a problem that was caused by an overreach by the previous administration. Don't take my word for it, take the courts which struck down the DACA  President Trump has continued it long enough to give Congress a chance to fix it. That is the appropriate response. It is not helpful just to engage in the blame game. We actually need to step up and not just give speeches on the floor of the Senate; we need to actually enter into a good-faith negotiation.  To date, President Trump has issued a reasonable framework that will not only give protection to those who were brought here illegally by their parents as children but also fixes other gaps in our broken immigration system--border security, the diversity lottery visa, and ensures that people who are waiting in line patiently can be unified with their family by narrowing the scope of family-based immigration in the future. That is prospective only. One proposal has been to plow those additional green cards into accelerating the passage of people who are patiently waiting in line--some as many as 10 and 20 years.  President Trump has done something President Obama never did. He has offered 1.8 million young adults who are currently DACA recipients and DACA-eligible an opportunity to get on a pathway to American citizenship. That is three times more than the young adults who were addressed by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program that President Obama did unilaterally. That is an incredibly generous offer.  What has the President requested in return or in addition? He said: Secondly, I want to secure our borders, and I want to address legal loopholes in the current law. That is important because we have to protect our citizens and regain the public trust. One of the very reasons this President was elected is because people are angry that the Federal Government has failed them when it comes to securing our borders and enforcing our laws. I believe the second pillar of what President Trump has talked about, border security, is really a system of physical infrastructure--fence, walls, barriers--but also technology and personnel; that those[[Page S623]]are the three essential ingredients in border security. We have to ensure that people don't flout the law and enter the country illegally. We all know a porous border is an opportunity for drug traffickers, human traffickers, and other criminals to exploit our porous border. As I said, it is not one-dimensional, it is not just about a wall or a fence or a barrier, it is about technology, personnel, and physical infrastructure as well, and the President has acknowledged as much.  I have heard our colleagues across the aisle bridle at what the President has requested in terms of not only a plan for border security but also for the funding. He said he wants $25 billion to make sure the Federal Government finally steps up and lives up to its responsibility on the border. It wasn't that long ago when the Gang of 8--Senator Durbin my friend from Illinois was one of the gang members--proposed and the Senate passed a bill by 68 votes that provided $50 billion for border security. It had other problems, but they were more than generous in providing for border security. Today they chafe and resist and refuse basically to negotiate on this item, when they voted for double that amount in the so-called Gang of 8 bill just a few years ago.  The President's third pillar relates to what is known as the diversity lottery visa. Many, including the President, have questioned whether it makes sense to just give out 50,000 green cards a year based on a lottery--a game of chance. They have suggested and the President has proposed that we use those green cards to reward skill and merit.  We ought to look at immigration as a way for us to attract the best and brightest, the people who have skills, talents, education, something to offer their new country when they come here. We don't have to end the diversity part, but we can add to it the skills that would help make our country better and allow these new citizens to contribute in a substantial way to their adopted country.  The fourth pillar addresses family unification. I say ``family unification'' because I think the recently adopted alternative term of ``chain migration'' has become a pejorative and oversimplifies a very complex area of the law. What the President has proposed is, in the future, we allow people to immigrate to the country based on family relationships, and we confine that to the nuclear family--mom, dad, and the kids. One suggestion has been that the green cards we would save by not allowing collateral family members to come in--married adult children, aunts, uncles, cousins, and the like, based strictly on the family relationship--we could plow those green cards back into the backlog because there are people who have been playing by the rules and waiting patiently in line, some for 10 or 20 years because of the caps we put on country immigration. Why doesn't it make sense to let them reunite with their family members even faster so they don't have to wait so long? I think that makes an awful lot of sense. During the time that backlog clears, there really wouldn't be any reduction in legal immigration.  I don't know what the right number is for legal immigration. We naturalize roughly about 1 million people a year. I support legal immigration. I think it makes our country better, but I am not sure exactly what the right number is, and I am not sure exactly what the right formula is. A number of countries, such as Australia and Canada, look at the skills and merit-based system, in addition to family relationships. I think that makes a lot of sense to me.  While we are continuing to have this discussion about what should be the long-term rate of legal immigration, it makes sense to plow these additional green cards--that will not be used prospectively by collateral family members based strictly on that family relationship--back into the backlog and unify the families who have been waiting for their loved one who has been waiting in line, waiting to immigrate legally into the United  One thing I really appreciate about the President's proposal is, it addresses shortcomings of the so-called Gang of 8 bill that was considered back in 2013. This is where I differ again from my colleague from He celebrates the fact that they were able to get 68 votes in the Senate, but it didn't pass the House, and it never got to the I am not sure that is a cause for celebration. What I would actually like to see is us take the President's four pillars and actually get a Presidential signature on a law that passes not only the Senate but the House and that the President will sign. I thought that was the goal, not just to go through some futile gesture or to pass one branch of the legislature only to fail in the  The reason the Gang of 8 bill failed in the House was because it had some serious problems. It had no real objective metrics to determine where technology and infrastructure would be the most effective. It didn't allow the Department of Homeland Security to achieve 24/7 situational awareness and 100 percent operational control of the border. It didn't adequately address the personnel and infrastructure improvements we know are desperately needed at our northern borders and our ports of entry.  Finally, even though the Gang of 8 bill contains some provisions to address criminal gangs, drunk drivers, and aggravated felons, it also had generous waivers and still allowed some criminals to qualify for legal status. That didn't make any sense to me then, and it makes no sense to me now. Why would we allow people with criminal records to immigrate into the United States?  Worse, the Gang of 8 bill didn't end catch-and-release of criminal aliens, and it did nothing to deter the influx of people who are exploiting a loophole in the law relating to unaccompanied minors. By way of contrast, the new White House proposal addresses these concerns in ways the flawed Gang of 8 bill did not, and I predict, if we embrace the President's four pillars and pass a bill that reflects those requirements, the House of Representatives could pass it, and the President would sign it, which would actually then provide a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million young people.  I don't know how some of our friends can look these young people in the face and say: We had the chance. You had the opportunity to receive one of the greatest gifts a human being could possibly accept, and that is a pathway to American citizenship, but we turned it down. Perhaps, we miscalculated, and we figured that, maybe, we can get it through the Senate but we can't get it through the House and we can't get a Presidential signature. So we ended up emptyhanded, and you remain in the same box you were in in the first place. How is that helping these young people? It is not.  Well, the White House proposal closes loopholes in the current law that are being exploited by criminal gangs and human traffickers. Let me explain. Under the current law, if somebody is under 18 years of age and shows up at the border, the Border Patrol processes them, and then they are given to Health and Human If they make a claim of some immigration benefit, they are given a notice to appear before an immigration judge, but the backlog there is so great that it could be years down the road, and then they are placed with a sponsor.  Here is the problem. First of all, there is no adequate monitoring of these individuals to make sure they actually show up for their court hearing. Current law allows them to be placed with a sponsor that is not legally present in the country in the first place. There are no criminal background checks. So we don't know whether these unaccompanied children are being placed with people who would abuse them, traffic them, or recruit them into criminal gangs.  In 2017 alone, the Department of Homeland Security apprehended 41,000 unaccompanied minors across the southern border, and 37 percent were between the ages of 15 and 16, and another 32 percent were 17 years old. So we are not talking about young children. We are talking about, by and large, grown young men. As I mentioned earlier, this number has increased significantly, with more than 11,000 unaccompanied minors being apprehended in the last 4 months alone.  They have figured this out. The transnational criminal organizations that traffic in human beings, drugs, weapons, and anything else that is worth a buck have figured this out. They have a loophole in the U.law that allows them to charge a fee to[[Page S624]]bring in these young men, who may or may not be a member of MS-13, one of the most violent criminal gangs in Central Now they are unfortunately in the United States, and there is no way for the U.Government to keep them out even if they are gang members, under current law.  Well, I don't know how our colleagues who refuse to take up this issue and address it justify it. I just can't understand it. In my opinion, we have a real problem that our colleagues either don't want to fix or they are deliberately ignoring. We can't solve these problems by just putting our head in the sand and hoping that the problem goes away. It will not. This is just one example of a loophole, which a border security bill that I introduced months ago, called the Building America's Trust Act, would fix.  So if our colleagues are serious about coming up with a solution to our immigration problems and providing a lifeline to these young adults who are DACA recipients and, indeed, everyone who is DACA-eligible, they need to work with us. They need to recognize the reality that President Trump has laid out a pathway for that to happen, but they can't just cherry-pick and pick the parts they like and ignore the rest and expect that we are going to get an outcome.  Again, the basic failure in the Gang of 8 bill was that they got 68 votes in the Senate, including $50 billion for border security, but they couldn't get it through the House and couldn't get it to the President for signature. I don't know how to sugar-coat it, but that is failure. That is not success. Success is to get a bill through both Houses and to get the President to sign it. President Trump has given all of us a map, a pathway for how to do that. To my knowledge, there has never been a counteroffer that addresses the four pillars that the President has proposed.  Again, I think the people with the most to lose out of this proposition, in addition to the great American people, are these young adults who would benefit from the stability and predictability and a path forward and would receive a gift, as I said, that would be the greatest gift that any human being could possibly aspire to, which is the gift of American citizenship, eventually. But it is going to be squandered. The President's generous offer will be squandered because our colleagues don't like his proposal, but they are unwilling to come up with a counteroffer so that we can actually have a negotiation. The President, I am sure, would welcome that counteroffer, and we would too.  We welcome an opportunity to actually get a result here, to make a law and not just go through a political exercise that is destined to end in failure and then become a political issue in the next election. That is not what we should be about here.  So I hope that reality will set in. President Trump has offered a proposal. Our colleagues on the other side, who don't like the proposal, have not offered a counteroffer that meets the four pillars. They don't even want to pay attention to the last two--the diversity visa issue or the so-called family unification, sometimes called chain migration. They want to act like that doesn't exist, and I just don't get it.  I come from a State of 28 million people, with 38 percent, roughly, of Hispanic origin. We have a 1,200-mile common border with Texas taxpayers pay for the border security that the Federal Government fails to fund and facilitate. I want to see a solution. I am happy to vote in favor of a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million people, but I can't go back home and look my constituents in the face unless I tell them that this is the last time we are going to have to do this because we fixed the underlying problem--border insecurity, gaps that are exploited by criminal gang members and the transnational criminal organizations that traffic in them, and these other issues that the President has put on the table.  So I hope reality does set in because I really would like to get a bill that we could pass in the House and the Senate and get to the President for his signature and move on to these other important issues: How do we fund our military? How do we fund the community health centers? How do we provide some predictability to the rest of America that is being held hostage to this issue?  I yield the floor.

457,topic-id,2578,"Madam President, here we are again. The clock is ticking. The current funding bill expires on Thursday, and we have to act to keep the lights on. That strikes me as a very modest goal because there is so much more we need to be doing. When our Democratic colleagues shut down the government last month, we knew that this was all we could get at the time, which is a short-term continuing resolution until February 8. Well, this is a miserable way to do business. Continuing resolutions are really an abdication of responsibility on behalf of this body and are not to the benefit of the American people.  It doesn't have to be this way. What we are waiting on is an agreement between the leaders of both the House and the Senate to come up with spending caps for the rest of 2018 and 2019. We could have that agreement today, but our colleagues across the aisle are dragging their feet, to put it mildly. For what? Well, it is the same reason that they shut down the government last month. It is over an unrelated immigration issue, which I will get to in a moment. They appear not to have learned any lesson from the shutdown, which clearly the American people did not want and did not agree with.  We have two distinct issues that need to be handled separately. Funding the government--particularly funding our military--shouldn't be held hostage to an immigration issue, especially when we continue to work together in good faith on border security and on the young adults who are affected by the deferred action on childhood arrivals, or  I say, let's drop DACA from the funding debate and submit the caps deal right now. As I have said before, short-term continuing resolutions are a terrible way to do business. Governing is not a merry-go-round. We shouldn't have to come back in March and have these same discussions over and over again.  This past February 2 happened to be my birthday, but it is also Groundhog Day, and we seem to wake up every morning and go through the same motions over and over and over again and never reach a conclusion. This was brought home to me pretty dramatically today when the leadership from Texas for the community health centers told me that they can't plan. They have employees and healthcare providers who are worried about whether they will have a job because government will somehow fail in keeping its doors open and keep their programs funded. And to boot, patients are worried about whether they are going to have continued access to healthcare, the community health centers that serve vast swaths of this country.  Why are people put through all this anxiety--both in terms of planning and in terms of the staff and the patients who depend on these community health centers--just because we can't seem to get our act together here and agree to those spending caps because they are being held hostage to another unrelated issue, which the majority leader has committed to addressing in due course.  Well, our colleagues seem to be content to drive around in circles, and--not to mix metaphors--they are spinning their wheels in the process, and nothing actually gets done. But maybe that is part of the plan too. If you look at 2017, we have had a pretty impressive 2017 in terms of what this Congress has accomplished when it comes to overregulations, when it comes to confirming Federal judges, including the Justice on the Supreme Court, Neil And then, of course, there is the big tax bill, which was really something that happens only every 30 years or so. It is very unusual. We are already beginning to see the beneficial results of that tax legislation, and people are learning more about it and will continue to learn more about it as they open their paycheck stubs and see how much more take-home pay they have. I am beginning to think that these short-term continuing resolutions and never reaching an agreement on spending caps are part of the plan to just keep us churning and to keep us not producing on behalf of the American people. I hope I am wrong, but it sure feels like that to me.  I hope our colleagues will change their tactics and learn from their mistakes. Shutdowns don't help anybody. They certainly don't help the party that is responsible for shutting down the government. So let's get this caps deal done in short order.  Here is another thing that has been held hostage to this unrelated immigration issue--disaster relief. It was last September when Hurricane Harvey hit the State of We had an unprecedented rain event where basically the hurricane parked itself over Houston, TX, and rained down 50 inches of rain in about 5 days, disrupting people's lives, destroying their homes. Some of the winds down along the coast blew businesses and homes away, and people are working hard to recover from that.  The House passed an $81 billion disaster relief bill--not just to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey but also the victims of Hurricane Maria in the Virgin Islands, in Florida, and in Puerto Rico as well. And then there are the wildfires and the mudslides out Eighty-one billion dollars was appropriated by the House of Representatives, and it has been sitting here since December with no action whatsoever. Why? Well, count that up as another hostage of this unrelated immigration issue or the desire to just force us to spin our wheels and not get things done. I don't understand it, and if I do understand it, I don't like it one bit.  The first rule of holes is, when you find yourself in a hole, quit digging. That is the only way to get a different outcome. But our Democratic colleagues have found themselves in a hole and insist on continuing to dig after the disastrous shutdown, leading us to basically driving in circles.  I would like to speak briefly about the ongoing border security and DACA negotiations. This is an issue that is very important to me, coming from a State with the largest, longest common border with Mexico, where we see firsthand the impact of illegal drugs, trafficking in human beings, and just the failure of the Federal Government to live up to its responsibility when it comes to securing our borders. We learned on 9/11/2001 how important it is to know who is coming into our country and why they are here, because not everybody who comes to the United States wants to do good by us. Some of them want to do us harm. And certainly that is true when it comes to trafficking in the poison that unfortunately comes across our borders and leaves so many lives in tatters as a result of overdoses and drug abuse.  I have talked to a number of my constituents in Texas, including Hispanic leaders, to try to bring them up to date on the discussions that occurred here because they care quite a lot about both of these issues--border security, as well as what we are going to do for these young adults whose only mistake was to come to this country with their parents when they were children.  As I have said before--and I will say it again--we don't hold children responsible for the mistakes their parents make. These young people deserve a clear path forward and some certainty in their lives. I think the vast majority of us would like to try to find some way to give it to them, but we are not going to do that unless we can get concrete progress on border security and other reasons why this problem was created in the first place.  It was good to get the perspective of a number of my constituents who happen to be leaders in the Hispanic community. Many of them live in border communities. All of them have families or friends who are immigrants. Of course, we are a nation of immigrants,[[Page S600]]and we need to listen to what they have to say about what is going on. There was general agreement that when it comes to offering a path to citizenship, the President's proposal was surprisingly generous. Nobody expected the President to offer a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million young adults. That was extraordinarily generous.  Right now, in the program that was created by President Obama, which will expire March 5, there are 690,000 DACA recipients. They are the people who signed up for this deferred action, not for a path to citizenship, not for legal status, but an agreement by the government that we are not going to try to deport them. They also get work permits during the pendency of their DACA status. This President has offered DACA recipients something President Obama never did--a pathway to citizenship for three times as many as are covered by the deferred action program.  The Hispanic leaders I spoke with also supported, in addition to that pillar of what the President proposed, additional border security measures. One spoke about the ``collateral benefits'' to border communities of new technology, personnel, and improved infrastructure. Jobs increase, restaurants and hotels benefit, communities are safer for the families and the children who live there.  They stress that when it comes to border security, we need to be thinking about it three-dimensionally. In other words, they said that we need to consider a system. I have heard the Secretary of Homeland Security refer to what the President has proposed as a wall system. It is not just a physical barrier; it is access roads, cameras, sensors, radars, aerostats, and other things to try to make sure our border is secure.  Ultimately, my conversation with these constituents was very constructive, but I had to be honest with them. I had to admit that I have been disappointed so far. I haven't heard much in the way of ideas from our Democratic colleagues, other than old proposals that will not become law. Even though they claim to support these young people, the DACA recipients, and even though they claim to support a pathway to citizenship for them, they have done nothing to respond to President Trump's very generous offer and the four pillars of his proposal. So far, they have indicated that they have little interest in negotiating.  The deadline set for those negotiations is February 8, just a couple of days from now. After that, we will be here on the Senate floor with an open and freewheeling debate and amendment process. But we want to achieve a solution that can become law, and so far, we haven't had a willing dance partner in our Democratic colleagues.  The President has made an extraordinary offer. I don't know whether it is because they don't want this President to claim any credit for any accomplishment or whether they prefer to have a political issue that they want to take to the election in November or whether they are just willing to toy with the lives of these young people because they deem it politically expedient. Well, none of those are acceptable. And it is really puzzling. There is no reason why they shouldn't support closing loopholes for our illegal immigration problem and increasing security on the border.  I have heard many of our colleagues across the aisle say: Border security? No problem--until you start asking them to be specific about what that means, not only in terms of an authorization or plan, but what does that mean in terms of appropriations or money?  According to published reports, the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York, Mr.Schumer, offered the President $25 billion toward border security--$5 billion upfront and $20 billion more in appropriations and authorization. Then, after they shut down the government, after the President made his proposal, he took that off the table. So far, we have heard nothing from our Democratic colleagues to respond to the President's generous, good-faith offer.  One thing we need to do for sure is to regain the public's confidence when it comes to immigration. We need to reclaim our legacy not only as a nation of immigrants, which we proudly are, but as a nation of laws. That is why people are so frustrated and emotional and angry about the status quo. That is one reason this President was elected. They thought he would bring an end to the lawlessness of our illegal immigration system. But in order to get this done, we have to be able to negotiate in good faith, and we have to be able to compromise, which leads me to wonder, again, whether our friends across the aisle want an issue they plan to take to the election in November or they actually want a solution.  Are they going to actually use these young DACA recipients as a means to accomplish their goal, which is to regain the majority in the House and the Senate after the November 2018 elections? I hope I am wrong, but I don't see any indication so far that I am.  As the President said in last week's State of the Union Message, the ultimate proposal should be one ``where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.'' That is exactly right.  In my home State of Texas, nearly 124,000 DACA recipients are our neighbors. They are an important thread in the fabric of our communities. All of us feel sympathy for these young adults who are in limbo. I remain committed to finding a solution because, in our country, we don't penalize children for the mistakes their parents made. But as the President said last week, ``Americans are dreamers, too,'' and part of their dream is to live in a country where the law is enforced and respected.  I support the President in his call for upholding the strong rule of law in this country, but the question for today is, Why hold everything else hostage for this unrelated immigration issue? And why, if our Democratic colleagues are willing to shut down the government over that unrelated immigration issue, aren't they willing to respond to the President's generous, good-faith offer to bring a solution to the problem? We need to know what their plans are. What is their proposal that can become law?  The clock is ticking. We know the ending date for this program is March 5. Ultimately, what we are dealing with is people's lives. What do our colleagues care most about? Do they care about political advantage or trying to preserve an issue that will be to their advantage in the upcoming election? Or do they actually care about these young DACA recipients, 690,000 of them, or the 1.8 million that President Trump has offered--an incredibly generous offer--as long as we can deal with these other issues like border security, chain migration, and the diversity lottery visa?  We are waiting for our Democratic colleagues to come to us with a good-faith proposal, but so far all we hear is crickets.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I will be the first to admit that I do not come to this debate without strong personal feelings. Like millions of Americans, I am the son of an immigrant. In 1911--107 years ago--my grandmother came to this country with three little kids. One of those kids was my mother. She was 2 years old when their ship landed in My grandmother didn't speak a word of English, but somehow she managed to take those three kids and make her way to join my grandfather in East Louis,  On the credenza behind my desk in the Capitol is my mother's naturalization certificate. I keep that as a reminder of my heritage. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is America's story. Because of my family history, I really believe in immigration. I believe it has been a positive force in  I remember going to Jurbarkas, Lithuania, which was a tiny village in 1911, and being taken on a tour of my mom's birthplace. She never made it back there, but I was able to see the church where she was baptized. They pointed out the well in the town square which people used. I thought to myself what it must have been like that evening when my grandparents called their friends and relatives together to tell them the news: They were leaving their home in They were leaving the church that had served their family for generations. They were leaving all of their friends and relatives. They were leaving behind every stick of furniture, the dogs, the cats, the chickens--everything--to go to a place where they didn't speak the language. They were going to this place called They had heard great stories about the land of opportunity, and they had heard about some Lithuanians who had gone to the city of East Louis, IL, and that is where they were headed.  I am sure those friends and relatives, walking away from that meeting, turned to one another and said: What ever got into their minds? They are giving up everything to go to a place where they don't even speak the language. They will be back.  Well, they never returned. Like millions and millions of Americans, they had the courage to come to America and to weather crisis after crisis in our family and to build a future. I stand here because of that decision.  How can you tell when a country is in decline? When immigrants stop wanting to come to that country, when they can't wait to leave that country. Many other developed countries have had this experience and watched their economies decline as a result. That has never been our experience in the history of  Look at our history. In every generation, immigrants have come to our[[Page S620]]shores from around the world and made us a better and stronger nation. Immigrants are not a drain on America; immigrants are the future of They are hard-working men and women who leave behind everything they know to build a new and better life for themselves and their children. They breathe new life into our country and help revitalize the American dream.  You have heard the stories. They go to Silicon Valley and take a look at some of the best and brightest when it comes to high-tech, and they marvel at how many of them were immigrants to this country who were finally able to take that great idea and turn it into a great business with a lot of well-paid employees, helping this country move forward.  It was 17 years ago that I introduced a bill called the DREAM It was bipartisan legislation that gave a path to citizenship to immigrants who came to the United States as children. These young people have come to be known as  I know the President went to a Republican retreat last week and mocked the term ``Dreamers.'' He did the same in the State of the Union address. I will tell you, I am proud of the term ``Dreamers.'' Before this bill was introduced, if you asked about Dreamers and who they were, most people would answer: Isn't that a British rock group? Today, Dreamers symbolize something in America--young people brought here who have grown up pledging allegiance to that flag, singing the only national anthem they ever have known, who want to be part of our future. Those are  Eight years ago, I sent a letter to President Dick Lugar, Republican Senator from Indiana, joined me in signing that letter. On a bipartisan basis, we asked for President Obama to find a way to protect the The President responded to our request. He established the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, better known as  DACA provides temporary legal status to Dreamers if they step up, identify themselves, register with the government, pay a $500 filing fee, and submit themselves to a criminal background check and then a national security background check. If they passed all of those things, under DACA, they were given temporary, renewable 2-year protection to stay in the United States, not be deported, and have the legal right to work.  DACA has been an extraordinary success. Almost 800,000 Dreamers have come forward and received DACA protection. It has allowed them to contribute more to this country that they love, as teachers and nurses and engineers and first responders and members of our military. Yes, these DACA individuals have stepped up, even though they do not have the legal rights of citizenship, raised their hands, and sworn to put their lives on the line for How many of us have done that? We should admire them for their commitment to this country. Instead, on September 5, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration was putting an end to this DACA That same day, the President called on Congress to ``legalize DACA.''  Now the deportation clock is literally ticking on these young people. As we gather here today, more than 18,000 of these young people have lost their protection under Beginning in less than a month, on March 5 of this year, every day for the next 2 years, 1,000 Dreamers will lose their work permits and be subject to deportation because of President Trump's decision.  The administration itself has warned us that if we do come up with legalization of DACA, they need time--maybe as long as 6 months--to make it work. What has Congress done in response to this challenge, in response to the fact that thousands of young people are losing this protection? The answer is one word: nothing. Not a single bill has passed the Senate or the House in response to the President's challenge, despite the fact that every single day 122 of these Dreamers, because of President Trump's decision, lose the protection of Teachers--almost 20,000 of them nationwide who are DACA recipients--are going to be in a situation where they have to leave behind their classrooms and their students. Nurses will be forced to leave behind their patients because of President Trump's decision. First responders, who have written an enviable record of courage in serving their communities, will be forced to leave those posts. Soldiers willing to die for America will be forced to leave the Army--forced to leave the Army they have volunteered to serve.  This isn't just a looming humanitarian crisis; it is an economic crisis as well. More than 91 percent of DACA Dreamers are gainfully employed and paying taxes to our government. The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reports that DACA-eligible individuals contribute an estimated $2 billion a year in State and local taxes. The Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA recipients will cost $60 billion and result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next decade. Are the DACA protectees a drain on society? Not according to the conservative Cato They are a plus for America, a plus for our economy.  Poll after poll shows overwhelming bipartisan support for the Even FOX News--no liberal media outlet--found that 79 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship for That includes 63 percent of those who identify as Trump voters.  When the Trump administration shut down the DACA Program, the President called on Congress to legalize the program. We have done nothing. The day after repealing DACA, President Trump reached a tentative agreement on DACA and border security with Senator Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, and Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. President Trump said: ``Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I.'' But very quickly, President Trump walked away from those words.  In October, the White House released 7 pages of what they called ``Immigration Principles''--their wish list when it came to immigration. It was a list of hard-line, anti-immigrant proposals, many of which have been opposed by both political parties in Then, 4 weeks ago, I was invited to a meeting on January 9 at the White House, to sit next to President Trump and about two dozen Members of The President said at that meeting, broadcast on live television, that he wanted to protect DACA recipients and he would sign any bipartisan bill that Congress sent to him. The President said: Send me a bill and I will sign it, and I will take the political heat. I heard it. So did He also said that Congress should first pass DACA legislation and that other immigration issues should wait for ``phase two, which would be comprehensive.'' That was good news for me and good news for Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South We had been working for 4 months on a bipartisan plan.  We came back to the Hill after that meeting on January 9. That evening and the next day, we hammered out an agreement--six Senators, three Democrats and three We called the President on January 11. I personally called him to tell him we had a bill, a bipartisan bill. I wanted him to hear about it, to know the details, and I hoped that it would solve the problem and challenge that we faced. It was a real compromise. The day after we finalized that agreement, after the House meeting, we addressed all of the priorities that the President had laid before us, including protection for the Dreamers and a significant, multibillion-dollar downpayment on our border security.  The President said he looked forward to Senator Graham's briefing him on that plan and would be back in touch with me. Then I received word, within minutes, that the President wanted me to join Senator Graham in going to the White Two hours later, Senator Lindsey Graham and I were at the White House, hoping that the President might embrace our bipartisan plan, but we were surprised and disappointed when we entered the Oval In a matter of an hour and a half, five of the congressional hard-liners on immigration had been invited in to shoot down our plan. The President's views, in a matter of less than 2 hours, had changed radically.  During our meeting, the President demanded $20 billion to build a wall on our southern border. He kept saying[[Page S621]]over and over: Give me $20 billion. I will build this wall in 1 year. The President reacted negatively to the agreement that we had reached in terms of protecting immigrants from Haiti from deportation and ensuring that immigrants from Africa would be permitted to come to our country. What I heard at that meeting had nothing to do with security and American jobs. It was a sad commentary by the President on his vision of immigration.  Then, 2 weeks ago, Senator Schumer, our Democratic leader, made another good-faith attempt to work with the White He made a generous offer to President Trump to fund the border wall, but after a promising meeting, within 2 hours, the President called and withdrew any offer. That was the third time Senate Democrats had offered to fund President Trump's wall in exchange for the Dream In other words, we have been willing to support a broadly unpopular and partisan proposal--the wall--in exchange for a broadly popular and bipartisan proposal--the Dream The President will not take ``yes'' for an answer. It is no wonder that Senator Schumer has said that trying to reach an immigration agreement with the President is ``like trying to negotiate with Jell-O.''  Two weeks ago, the White House released a 1-page ``Framework on Immigration Reform & Border Security.'' The White House claims this is a compromise because it includes a path to citizenship for some I might add that it is an issue that is supported by the overwhelming majority of American people. The plan would put the administration's entire hard-line immigration agenda on the backs of these young people.  For example, the White House wants to dramatically reduce legal immigration by prohibiting American citizens from sponsoring their parents, siblings, and adult or married children as immigrants. We are talking about, literally, millions of relatives of American citizens who have done the right thing, followed our immigration laws, and have been waiting patiently in line for as long as 20 years to come to the United  Listen to what the Cato Institute says about the White House proposal:       [I]n the most likely scenario, the new plan would cut the      number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent or half a      million immigrants annually--the largest policy-driven legal      immigration cut since the 1920s. Compared to current law, it      would exclude--[the President's proposal]--nearly 22 million      people from the opportunity to immigrate legally to the      United States over the next [50 years].  This proposal would gut the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which established our current immigration system, with its focus on reuniting families.  When you think about the bedrock principles of America--faith, family, love of country--why would we assault this effort to unify and strengthen our families in America with those who are following this process in a legal manner?  The 1965 law, which this would change dramatically, replaced the strict national origin quotas of the 1924 immigration law. The 1924 immigration law was written to specifically exclude people whom the Congress and President, in those days, thought should not be part of America's future. They were focusing on people from my part of the world. My family came from the They focused on the Baltics and Eastern European countries--to restrict their immigration to this country. Luckily for me, my family got over before the 1924 law. They also wanted to exclude Italians in their belief that we had had enough from that country, and they wanted to exclude That is what that 1924 National Security Act was about.  When President Lyndon Johnson signed the 1965 law, he said: ``It corrects a cruel and enduring wrong. . . . For over four decades the immigration policy of the United States has been twisted and distorted by the harsh injustice of the national origins quota system.''  Listen to what Presidential Calvin Coolidge said when he signed the 1924 law, the last major reduction in legal immigration in America:       There are racial considerations too grave to be brushed      aside. Biological laws tell us that certain people will not      mix or blend. The Nordics propagate themselves successfully.      With other races, the outcome shows deterioration on both      sides.  I cannot understand why Attorney General Sessions, at one point, praised that 1924 law and said it was ``good for America.''  The President's immigration framework would also fast-track the deportations of women and children who come to our border in their fleeing gang and sexual violence. Since our tragic failure during World War II to aid Jewish refugees who fled the Holocaust, the United States has led the world, since then, in providing a safe haven to people who flee war, terrorism, and persecution. Now we are in the midst of the worst refugee crisis on record, with 65 million people worldwide being forcibly displaced, including child refugees from Central America, the Northern Triangle, who are fleeing horrific violence.  Consider the opinion of General John Kelly back in 2015, the current White House Chief of Staff, when he headed the U.Southern General Kelly said then that the children from Central America who are arriving on the U.S.-Mexico border are ``the direct result of our drug consumption'' in the United General Kelly said, ``In many ways [parents] are trying to save their children'' from the violence in their own countries. General Kelly was right in 2015.  In the past, Democrats have supported some of the President's proposals, like changes in our family immigration system and eliminating the diversity visa lottery. I might remind my colleagues that that was all part of a significantly comprehensive immigration reform bill.  I was part of the Gang of 8 that drafted the original bill--four Republicans, four We brought that bill to this floor in 2013 and won a vote--68 to 32. The bill was a product of months of negotiations and compromise. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives refused to even consider it.  Now we are being asked to accept this administration's proposals with no conditions and no give-and-take. If the administration wants to reform our legal immigration system, we have some priorities that we care for as well.  If we are talking about protecting national security, why aren't we closing the loopholes in the Visa Waiver Program? There are 20 million people from 38 nations who travel to America every year on the Visa Waiver Program--one-third of all of the visitors to the United They arrive in American airports without undergoing biometric checks or consular interviews. Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker of 9/11, tried to enter the U.through the Visa Waiver So did Richard Reid, the Shoe We should strengthen the Visa Waiver Program by requiring biometric checks of travelers before they land in America so that we know who they are before they board the airplanes.  If you are really sincere about the security of our Nation, this is an obvious need. Congress should also close the loophole that lets people enter the United States through the Visa Waiver Remember, there are 20 million a year. We allow them to buy guns, even assault weapons, even if they are on the FBI's terrorist watch list. When it comes to security, that is an obvious loophole that needs to be closed.  With the President's failing to lead, the responsibility to fix the DACA crisis falls on our shoulders here in  I see my colleague from Texas, Senator He and I have talked extensively about this. I still hold out hope that we may be able to find some way to resolve this in a bipartisan fashion. We have to do it because, to date, Congress--the Senate and the House--have done nothing.  Three weeks ago, a bipartisan group of Senate Republicans and Democrats finally persuaded Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, to commit to addressing I salute him for doing that. He made a statement on the floor twice, unequivocally, that we would bring this measure up if we had not reached an agreement by this Friday and that we would consider starting with what he called a level playing field--amendments on both sides--on the issue of immigration and We haven't seen that kind of debate on the floor of the U.Senate in over 1 year.[[Page S622]]  If it comes to that, I look forward to it. I would like to see the Senate work its will, and I hope that we will come up with a positive and constructive compromise. We have only 3 days from today for that process to start, and I hope that we can make some progress. Bipartisan legislation to protect the Dreamers has been pending in Congress, and it has overwhelming support from the people we represent, including President Trump's own voters. It would pass on a strong bipartisan vote in both the House and the Senate if Republican leaders would bring it to a vote.  I look forward to that debate.  I yield the floor.

548,topic-id,252,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for yielding and for the good work she is doing on this and so many other bills.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.  In today's world, when technology allows us to constantly be logged into the workplace, it is understandable that Americans often find themselves seeking more convenient meals outside of the home.  But dining out should not be about sacrificing nutrition. I believe Americans should have all the tools necessary to make informed choices about what they eat and what they feed their families.  Why wouldn't we want that? Why wouldn't we let the consumer decide? Why would we try to rob some tools and take things away from them?  Menu labeling gives Americans those tools, and we have been making progress towards more transparent labeling for consumers. It is a good thing.  This bill, H.772, would undo that process. It delays much-needed transparency and will cause confusion for both consumers and businesses, many of which have already started implementing existing menu labeling requirements.  So let's not turn back the clock. Menu labeling is both a vital public health tool and an important consumer protection. People are smart enough to make their own choices. If you want to make it impossible for them to know everything, then you are not allowing the consumer to make the final choice in an informed way. I don't see why we would want to do that.

201,topic-id,1250,"Mr.Speaker, I stand here representing the Congressional Black Caucus and our chairman, Cedric Richmond, who has initiated this particular Special Order for the Congressional Black Caucus to have this opportunity to speak to the issues specifically connected to the African-American community.  As a result of the chairman's leadership, we have laid out an agenda that we think is very appropriate to lay out. We think it is important that all of our constituents, particularly all Americans, recognize that the Congressional Black Caucus has solutions.  There is a document here that was put together under the leadership of Chairman When the President stated sometime in August of 2016: ``What do you have to lose?'' the chairman came up with the idea of a document that we would lay out, ``We Have a Lot to Lose: Solutions to Advance Black Families in the 21st Century.''  Over this next year or so, we will be talking about solutions relating to African-American communities. We think that African-American communities, like all Americans, should recognize that there are solutions to some of these challenges.  With the President giving his speech last week on the state of the Union, the topic that we will talk about today is economic justice in the Black community. The topic, again, is economic justice in the Black community.  First, I thank my wonderful colleagues for joining me here today to speak about economic justice in the Black community, an important topic to us all.  The Black community has a lot to lose under the current administration. The racial wealth gap is widening. The GOP tax cut bill will not help, especially when the Speaker of the House tweets about a $1.50 increase and actually believes that this is a fair solution to our Nation's problems.  Costco membership for the middle class and others in need, new yachts and Gulfstreams for millionaires and billionaires--that is just not right. We are in the business of doing no harm.  To add to this, the President stands up and brags that the unemployment rate for Blacks is at the lowest, even while the unemployment rate for Black Americans actually went up a whole percent last month according to the Bureau of Labor We did not hear from the President on that.  You can't take credit for the good, but not accept the bad. It is all about accountability and credibility, Mr.There is nothing to brag about.  To gain wealth comparison to White high school dropouts, Black people have to complete high school and some college, which is a very sad fact. This means that Black Americans need to invest more resources and time to achieve the same resources as White citizens, to make the same level of investments.  Generally, the typical Black American has little room for error. The demands placed on Black families to generate income while navigating the[[Page H768]]problems that always arise are numbing.  Black Americans have levels of net worth that are one-tenth the net worth of White  Black Americans have only 8 percent of their wealth in businesses. Research shows that Black entrepreneurs have higher wealth levels and higher levels of wealth mobility than the Black nonentrepreneur. The lack of wealth makes it harder to start and maintain a business.  According to data from various reports, including the Census Bureau, the Federal Reserve's survey of small businesses, and the Kauffman Foundation, Black-owned businesses are more reliant on their own investment in their businesses because access to capital from external sources is too difficult to obtain.  To give you some context of what is at stake in our neighborhoods nationwide, I represent a district with a poverty rate of 26 percent. That means 196,000 people in my district are at the poverty level.  We know that one of the best solutions to addressing poverty is quality of jobs.  Let me repeat that, Mr.We know that one of the best solutions to addressing poverty is the quality of jobs.  The President and his administration talk a big game about creating jobs and lowering unemployment, but we all know too well that this is not the reality in our neighborhoods nationwide. A 2015 CFPB report found that 15 percent of Black Americans are credit invisible, meaning that they have no or limited credit.  Black Americans have higher levels of student debt, on average. Forty percent of Black Americans between 25 and 55 hold student loan debt. Black Americans have higher levels of those debt loads, holding an average of $43,725.  Let me repeat that. They have an average of $43,725 in student debt, compared to an average of $31,367 for  Our Historically Black Colleges and Universities must be capable of delivering a world-class education and continuing to attract top-notch students.  Let's talk about the solutions to economic injustice. Let's talk about the solutions.  In this document, we talk about the solutions. For example, don't cut taxes for the superrich while others are struggling to make ends meet. Adopt a fair Tax Code that doesn't pick winners or losers.  Work to implement the Congressional Black Caucus 10-20-30 formula all across all agencies. This bold and innovative idea would require Federal agencies to commit 10 percent of their budget to the 485 counties where 20 percent or more of the population have been living below poverty lines for 30 years.  We should also address food insecurity by providing access to healthy, affordable food. Mr.Speaker, more than 30 million Americans live more than a mile from the nearest grocery store.  Let's be clear: our food policy is our foreign policy. Our food policy is our foreign policy. When America helps with food and development aid around the world, it sends a signal that we are leaders in the global campaign to help end hunger.  In addition, as a member of the Small Business Committee and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access, it is critical that we support and expand small business and entrepreneurship opportunities.  One of the things the President can do is increase the budget of the Minority Business Development Agency instead of slashing its budget, as it did last year. That is one of the solutions that we have in this document.  We can also increase the Small Business Administration's budget, while ensuring the Small Business Development Centers are capable of providing assistance expanding the SBA 7(a) Microloan program, which would give small businesses $50,000 to start or grow their firms, a capital fusion that can help individuals who have ideas and a dream but no cash.  Mr.Speaker, every day, graduates of our fine universities in Pennsylvania go to work but still find themselves behind or just keeping up with their student loans. This is an opportunity to show support for entrepreneurs by forgiving part of the student loan debt in terms of entrepreneurs.  The President should also make new markets tax credits permanent. He should also condition the fintech charters of compliance with truth in lending and equal credit access, using a template similar to that in the Community Reinvestment  He should set up the 21st Century Technology Fund and reauthorize the improvement of the Community Development Block Grant program.  Mr.Speaker, the chairman, whom I will later introduce, presented this document to the President, along with the executive branch.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Payne), someone whom I have known for an awful long time. He knows a lot about economic development.

They spoke of his kindness, his great attitude, and his constant willingness to lend a hand. They shared their fond memories of him attending ribbon cuttings, banquets, community meetings, and more.

145,topic-id,598,"Mr.President, I wish to speak in opposition to President Trump's proposal to open all offshore waters in the country to oil drilling.  This proposal has been met with outrage from every corner, as my colleagues are making clear here on the Senate floor today.  I would like to take a minute to remind everyone of what is at stake.  Before the Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez spills, Santa Barbara, CA, experienced the worst oil spill in U.S history.  In 1969, an offshore oil rig in Federal waters spilled more than 3 million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific  The environmental disaster killed thousands of marine mammals and birds. Our local beaches were coated by a thick layer of oil. Tourists were turned away, and commercial fishing operations were shut down, hurting the local economy.  After that spill, California decided that enough was enough. State agencies blocked all new offshore oil drilling in State waters up to 3 miles from the shore. The State reinforced this ban with the California Coastal Sanctuary Act in 1994.  Through a combination of local ordinances, congressional opposition, and moratoria imposed by Presidents from both parties, our State has also fought off any new drilling in Federal waters beyond 3 miles from the shore since 1984.  The Trump administration has now proposed undoing our progress by opening all Federal waters, including the waters off California's coast, to new gas and oil drilling.  If his proposal is allowed to go through, it would lead to the first new offshore oil drilling leases sold in the Pacific Ocean in more than 30 years.  So far, an exception has been made for Florida, hastily announced by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in response[[Page S647]]to concerns from Florida's Republican  That is completely arbitrary and not acceptable.  It is clear California also staunchly opposes this plan. According to the latest polling, nearly 70 percent of Californians oppose new drilling off our coast.  Senator Harris and I, together with our colleagues in the House of Representatives, have repeatedly shared our concerns with Secretary  The Secretary has even received statements of opposition from California's Governor, senate, assembly, attorney general, coastal commission, fish and game commission, State lands commission, and more than two dozen counties and cities.  So why are we not being given the same deference as Florida?  Unlike this administration, California understands that offshore oil drilling belongs in the past. We are making smarter investments in clean energy and renewable sources. Our State is on target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050.  The President's proposal would undermine that progress.  The Trump administration's proposed six new lease sales off the California coast would lead to new oil rigs that would continue to produce oil for decades to come.  That is well past the time we will need to have moved away from fossil fuels altogether.  Even though California has fought off new Federal drilling for three decades, there are still 43 leases that remain active from Federal lease sales prior to 1984.  In State waters, there are still nine active rigs that were built before the Santa Barbara oil spill.  We are still dealing with the legacy of last century's drilling, but it is our responsibility to leave a better legacy for the next century.  California won't allow new offshore oil rigs to create another generation of dirty carbon emissions and disastrous oil spills.  California, along with our coastal State friends, has rejected President Trump's offshore drilling proposal.  It is time to respect our local opposition and completely scrap this plan.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS646-4.txt,1332,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017--Continued,2018.0,6.0,February
493,topic-id,1279,"Mr.President, on January 6, 2017, the U.intelligence community released a shocking report.  It stated: ``We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016, aimed at the U.presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.''  This wasn't just one intelligence agency, it was a unanimous conclusion of the entire intelligence community.  It sent shockwaves throughout our entire government. This isn't about Republicans versus Democrats, it is about a foreign President ordering an attack on our democracy.  President Putin's goal was clear: to sow division and discord and to undermine public faith in our democratic processes and the rule of law.  Almost immediately we saw concerns and calls for action from both sides of the aisle.  Bipartisan congressional investigations were initiated to figure out exactly what happened and how to prevent it from happening again.  However, despite this promising beginning, the commitment to uncover the facts and protect our country from outside attacks has devolved into an inside attack on our own democratic institutions.  Sadly, rather than serving as a unifying force, President Trump has done all he can to undermine the intelligence community's assessment.  What is worse, he has utterly failed to take strong actions against Russia--and in some cases has rewarded Russia by changing U.policy.  Instead of supporting a robust and independent investigation into what Russia did and who was involved, the President instead is working to halt the investigations altogether.[[Page S645]]  Unfortunately, the President hasn't been alone in these efforts.  Last week, Congressman Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, pushed for the declassification of a transparently political memo written by his staff.  Here are some things we know about the memo and the process to release it: We know that the memo confirms the FBI's Russia investigation was not triggered by the dossier or by Carter  In fact, the investigation started because another Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadapolous, was told in April that Russia had ``dirt'' on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.  We also know that, while Carter Page was not the reason the Russia investigation started, the government had a reasonable belief that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power.  We know that Congressman Nunes did not review the underlying classified documents himself.  These documents include the FISA warrant renewal applications, which must show what the government was learning about Carter  Instead of reviewing these documents himself, the chairman relied solely on his staff, who may or may not have been coordinating this campaign with the White We don't know because Congressman Nunes refuses to answer that question.  We know that Chairman Nunes refused to allow the Department of Justice and FBI to brief all Members on the underlying documents before and after the memo's release.  We know that Congressman Nunes refused to allow Democrats to issue their own analysis of the classified documents along with his memo.  And we know that Russian social media bots assisted in the efforts to influence American public opinion concerning the memo.  The drafting and release of this partisan, misleading memo was particularly disturbing to me.  As Senator McCain stated last week, ``If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him.''  Intelligence and law enforcement oversight should never be used as a political weapon.  I have served on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 17 years, and I can't recall a single instance when an intelligence report was handled in this manner or a situation where additional views were actively blocked from being released.  This has been true even with the most controversial issues like the Intelligence Committee's investigation of the Benghazi attacks or the report on the CIA's use of torture.  In both of these instances, the committee held bipartisan meetings and shared drafts of report language between the majority and minority.  For the torture report, the CIA was offered and accepted opportunities to respond and request changes. The committee revised its report where appropriate and even cited disagreements in footnotes.  Once public, the committee included additional views from Republicans on the committee. The CIA's response was made public. There was a very thorough declassification process to ensure the summary was safe to release.  In fact, even though the final report was completed in 2012, the executive summary wasn't made public until December 2014 in order to ensure the process was properly followed.  There were disagreements, but the minority party was not cut out of the process.  That is not how the Senate works, that is not how democracy works, and it is not how any congressional committee or investigation should operate.  What I have described so far was the process and political implications of the Nunes memo, but it is just one part of an extensive pattern of abuse of power.  What we are seeing is a sustained, coordinated effort to diminish, weaken, and destabilize our top law enforcement officials, and we all should take exception to that.  Both the rushed manner and the disputed contents of the Nunes memo are a case in point.  After the memo was released on Friday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff hit the nail on the head.  He called the public release of misleading allegations against the FBI and the Justice Department ``a shameful effort to discredit these institutions, undermine the Special Counsel's ongoing investigation, and undercut congressional probes.''  He is absolutely right.  And this is just the latest in a long pattern of attempts to undercut the FBI and Justice  Some of the efforts were blatant.  After FBI Director Comey refused to pledge his loyalty to the President, the President fired him, an action the President himself admitted was tied to the Russia investigation.  The President has engaged in a series of tweets attacking the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General and Deputy Director of the FBI, among others.  There have also been media reports that the President has considered firing both Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, but many of the efforts by the President and his team weren't quite as obvious.  We have seen multiple reports that the President demanded personal loyalty from top law enforcement officials including Comey and  In fact, President Trump frequently calls the Attorney General ``his'' Attorney General and refers to ``my FBI'' and ``my Department of Justice.'' In fact, they aren't his, they are American people's.  Media reports also say that President instructed White House Counsel Don McGahn to keep the Attorney General from recusing himself from the Russia investigation.  Two heads of intelligence agencies, DNI Director Dan Coats and NSC Director Michael Rogers, said they felt pressure from the President to say there was no collusion with  And it has become apparent that many of the actions taken by the White House, Congressman Nunes, and others have been coordinated with conservative media like FOX  Objectivity and nonpartisanship are core components of the FBI and the Justice To either attempt to co-opt them or punish them for not kowtowing to the President's political whims is egregious.  Our Founding Fathers placed enormous trust in the legislative branch to serve as an effective check on the President, and it is time to do our job.  Congress needs to work alongside Special Counsel Mueller to get answers for the American people.  The Nation deserves to understand exactly what happened and who was involved, and all of us need to believe the President isn't above the law and will not be allowed to abuse his position for personal gain.

483,topic-id,824,"Mr.President, we have an opportunity before us today to fund key priorities that we all agree are important. The American people elected all of us to do a job, and that job is to provide for the most important functions of our government.  For far too long, politics has prevented us from committing the resources necessary to sustain the most critical part of our government--the military that keeps us safe. This is a chance to cast aside partisan differences and give the Department of Defense the stable and consistent funding it needs so it can rebuild readiness and execute its mission.  Just this morning, Secretary Mattis testified before Congress, saying: ``I ask that you not let disagreements on domestic policy continue to hold our nation's defense hostage.'' He is right. We cannot let these basic issues distract us from the job that we have all, under the Constitution, taken to provide for the common defense.  I just came from a classified briefing with the Secretary, and he outlined the most important needs we must fund for our country's security. So why not come together on issues we can agree on? Six months ago, this Chamber passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 89 to 9. In the time since, however, our military remains hamstrung under short-term measures that are standing in the way of modernization and readiness.  That is why I say to my Democratic colleagues, here is a chance for you to prove that you are serious about funding the military. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have already spoken clearly about their desire to support the troops.  Last month, the senior Senator from Vermont remarked:       Our military leaders agree, we cannot govern by a      continuing resolution. The military cannot function under      sequestration.  The senior Senator from West Virginia said:       We want our military to be funded properly so they can      defend us.  The senior Senator from Montana said:       The uncertainty we have without a longer budget that goes      to the end of the fiscal year is unacceptable.  The senior Senator from Connecticut said:       I hope there is bipartisan consensus among us on the Armed      Services Committee and in the Chamber as a whole that we need      a strong national defense.  Even today, the minority leader told this body that Democrats ``support increasing funding for our military.''  So why not act?

Across our Nation, community health centers are vital to keeping our children and our families healthy.  Last year, nearly 85,000 Nebraskans received care at centers across our State during approximately 296,000 visits. These centers provide high-quality care, compassionate care, and patient-focused care. Community health centers in my State rank second in quality measures nationally and first in four other measures involving individual care. Their focus and their impact on the communities they serve is very impressive.  We all recognize the importance of these health centers, and I was proud to recently join my colleagues in the Senate in urging that funding be reauthorized so these centers can continue to provide the quality care all Nebraskans and all Americans deserve.  Our military and community health centers are too important to be caught up in politics. As we find ourselves once again facing the prospect of yet another impasse, I urge my colleagues to join me in showing your support for these critical areas.

Under Donna's leadership, the number of visitors to the museum increased exponentially, and the 40th and 50th anniversary events were great successes.  I want to express my deep gratitude and the gratitude of our entire community for Donna's commitment to preserving the history of our community. While her retirement is well deserved, her exit is already felt.  Thank you,                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-05-pt1-PgH741.txt,1797,CIVILITY AND TRUST,2018.0,5.0,February
467,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, last fall I had the honor to stand in this Chamber and deliver remarks on the subject of a great and growing concern to me--the stewardship of our democracy at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. I stand again today to sound the same alarm.  Words matter. Have we arrived at such a place of numb acceptance that we have nothing to say when the President of the United States casually suggests that those who choose not to stand or applaud his speech are guilty of treason? I certainly hope not.  The one who levels such a charge knows neither the meaning of ``treason'' nor the power that the words of a President carry. If we are numb to such words, then we will surely regret that we failed to defend our colleagues in Congress against such a vile remark, but our silence will also mark the day we failed to recognize that this conduct in an American President simply is not normal.  I wish I could stand here today and say my words of last October have been proven wrong; that I had been unfair to inveigh against the daily sundering of our country; that I had been mistaken about the personal attacks; that I had exaggerated the threats against principles, freedoms, and institutions, the flagrant disregard for truth and decency, and the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people we have all been elected to serve--I wish I could say I had been wrong, but I cannot.  I have seen the President's most ardent defenders use the now-weary argument that the President's comments were meant as a joke, just sarcasm, only tongue in cheek, but treason is not a punch line.  The President said the State of the Union Address was meant to promote and encourage unity in government. Then why, less than a week later, follow up with this divisive and harmful rhetoric? Unity is not secured in a speech. It must be pursued constantly through appropriate behavior, mutual respect, and gained by effective leadership. Respect is earned, not commanded. Applause signals approval of an idea, not loyalty to one's country.  Our Democratic colleagues love this country as much as we do. To suggest otherwise is simply unconscionable. None of us in Congress pledge loyalty or service to the This is not a royal court. Our oath is to the Constitution and to the people. As Members of Congress, we must never accept undignified discourse as normal because of the requirements of tribal party politics.  None of this behavior should ever be regarded as normal. We must never allow ourselves to lapse into thinking this is just the way things are now.  We will get through this period, and when we do, we will look back at the destruction of our discourse and the attacks on our democratic values as nothing but a tragedy. May we also be able to say they were an aberration. That, my colleagues, is up to us. We must recognize this is aberrant, destructive behavior, whatever rationale its defenders may offer, and we must never shrink from opposing it, for it is in opposing this behavior that we defend our norms, our ideals, and our values. It is in opposing this behavior that we stand for decency.  Thank you.[[Page S630]]  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Hoeven).

149,topic-id,591,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce very much for his help on this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I am here to speak in support of the War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act, introduced by my good friend Eliot Engel and me. It is another excellent example today of bipartisanship here in the  As Chairman Royce said, this bill expands and reforms the War Crimes Rewards Program, which provides bounties for perpetrators of the world's worst human rights abusers.  The current program authorizes these rewards only for the purposes of prosecutions in international tribunals. While experts can attest to the necessity of international tribunals or mixed court tribunals in limited circumstances, the program fails to offer[[Page H761]]the same advantages and incentives to prosecutions in national jurisdictions using national courts.  There is already broad consensus that prosecuting perpetrators of atrocities like the genocide that plagues religious minorities at the hands of ISIS has the greatest impact when the prosecutions are conducted within the society in which the crimes occurred.  When governments can keep these prosecutions within national jurisdictions, witnesses have easier access to courts, public awareness of these brutal atrocities is maximized, and parties will more likely understand domestic laws. Furthermore, domestic trials are often cheaper, quicker, and less resource intensive, meaning more resources can be devoted to items like discovery and analysis.  Congress has already attested to the threat that these crimes posed to U.interests, including the heavy price tag in the forms of regional instability, refugee flows, economic losses, and reconstruction costs.  A related program, the Rewards for Justice Program, authorizes similar bounties for terrorists wanted by the United States for violations of United States law, most famously, the one that was placed upon Osama bin The bounties have led to the disruption of terrorist activities, but also to the prosecution of terrorists like Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade  Our bill would bring the War Crimes Rewards Program into conformity with that standard by explicitly listing violations of U.law as a basis for issuing the reward, not just the conviction by an international tribunal. It would also allow the U.to work with our allies to issue joint rewards, another provision in the terrorism authorization that the human rights provision lacks.  This bill will leave important safeguards already incorporated into the current program in place. These safeguards include the ineligibility of government officials, consultation with the Attorney General, and congressional notification of the awards.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, national governments are sovereign, and the U.Government shouldn't be neglecting their proper role by offering this tool solely to tribunals. Currently, there are efforts to encourage the prosecution of ISIS perpetrators of rape and genocide against Yazidis in national courts using domestic laws that provide for such prosecutions. This bill would make it clear that the U.Government should also be encouraging such efforts.  The genocide by ISIS fighters in the Middle East; war crimes perpetrated by Syria's brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad; and the North Korean regime's crimes against its own people must all be opposed by the United It is my hope that the passage of this bill will send the signal that these brutal atrocities and the cowards who perpetrate them will be hunted down and punished with all means possible.  I thank my good friend and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, for his role as the lead Democrat cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for bringing this to the floor. Lastly, I thank the committee staff for their thoughtful contributions and assistance.

411,topic-id,573,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, for the fifth time since last fall, I rise today to present another continuing resolution, the House amendment to Senate amendment to H.1892, to fund the operations of the Federal Government through March 23, fund the Department of Defense for the rest of fiscal year 2018, and extend critical healthcare programs, including funding for community health centers.  Our current continuing resolution expires on Thursday, and without this legislation, large segments of the Federal Government will shut down again. Of course, all of us are keenly aware that more time is needed for our leaders in the House, the Senate, and the White House to negotiate overall funding levels for the 2018 fiscal year. This bill should allow that to happen.  Mr.Speaker, this continuing resolution also makes a very limited number of technical changes in funding levels for only the most essential needs, including:  To prevent delays in preparation for the 2020 Census;  To ensure that the judicial branch is able to pay jurors;  To provide $225 million in emergency funding for the Small Business Administration to provide emergency loans to those whose lives and livelihoods were destroyed by last year's historic natural disasters.  This legislation also includes the full fiscal year 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, totaling $659 billion for our Armed  And I don't have to remind my colleagues that this bill has already passed this House three times on a bipartisan basis--most recently, last week.  Mr.Speaker, we ask a great deal of our men and women in uniform, and we have an obligation to provide them and their families the resources they need to be safe, to complete their missions successfully at home and abroad. Governing from CR to CR just creates more unpredictability, more instability, and has real-life consequences for both our troops and civilians who support them.  Mr.Speaker, the challenges we face around the world cannot be met under this Federal CR stop-and-go process. While we delay doing the Nation's business, our military and economic competitors are consolidating their gains.  Finally, I would add, this legislation includes necessary funding extensions for bipartisan health priorities like community health centers and other public health programs. It also funds important Medicare extenders and includes commonsense reforms and improvements in the program.  But let no one doubt our position on continuing resolutions. They are bad fiscal policy. They do not allow programs to grow, to be reduced or eliminated, if that is needed. They maintain outdated policies and stop new, critically important programs from ever starting, including programs that enhance national security and protect our Armed Forces from our enemies.  Continuing resolutions are fiscally wasteful and prevent the executive branch and Congress from planning and preparing, and this is true for the private sector as well.  Most importantly, they undermine congressional oversight that is constitutionally mandated for our appropriations.  While I am pleased that we are here to include the Defense Appropriations[[Page H889]]bill in this continuing resolution, we must still pass all 12 appropriations bills for the 2018 fiscal year, as well as our third emergency disaster supplemental.  As soon as congressional and White House leaders reach a bipartisan agreement, which could and should happen at any moment, our committee will get to work immediately to finish negotiations on all 12 year-long funding bills.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

452,topic-id,452,"Mr.Speaker, I am in receipt of the Statement of Administration Policy, which indicates that the administration supports this continuing resolution and that the President's advisers would recommend his signature on the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration Policy dated February 6, 2018.                   Statement of Administration Policy     House Amendment to H.1892--Further Extension of Continuing            Appropriations Act, 2018--Frelinghuysen, R-NJ       The Administration supports the House Amendment to the      Senate Amendment to H.1892, the Further Extension of      Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018. This bill funds most      Government programs at current levels through March 23, 2018,      while incorporating the text of the House-passed fiscal year      (FY) 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which      provides the resources the military needs to keep the Nation      safe. As the Administration has noted previously, the House-     passed Department of DefenseAppropriations Act is consistent      with the President's pledge to undo the looming defense      spending reductions that are harmful to America's national      security and military readiness.       The House-passed Department of Defense Appropriations Act      incorporated in the bill includes a total of $659 billion for      the Department of Defense (DOD), including $584 billion in      base spending and $75 billion for Overseas Contingency      These amounts are consistent with a total funding      level for DOD similar to that authorized by the National      Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which was      signed into law by the It includes $1.2 billion      requested by the Administration to support increased troop      levels in Afghanistan, special operations forces      capabilities, and other urgent needs.       The United States military's greatest asset is the men and      women who volunteer to serve. This bill keeps faith with      service members by providing a 2.4 percent military pay      raise. It increases end strength across the military services      for active duty, reserve, and National Guard personnel, and      includes funding for training and maintenance to ensure that      United States troops are properly equipped and ready to      fight.       In addition to supporting the defense bill, the      Administration supports language in the House Amendment to      H.1892 that provides for an extension of a variety of      healthcare provisions, including Community Health      The Administration is also appreciative that the bill      includes language requested by the Administration to ensure      continuity of operations for the 2020 Decennial Census      Program and the Small Business Administration's Disaster      Loans       The Administration supports continuing discussions over a      two-year budget agreement that ensures funding for national      defense and other priorities. As those discussions continue,      however, it is dangerous to[[Page H896]]     hold defense funding for the current fiscal year hostage to      arbitrary demands for lower-priority domestic programs.       If the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act,      2018, were presented to the President in its current form,      his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.

151,topic-id,1870,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.King), my dear friend, for all of his work in this area; not just his work, but his leadership.  I know his heart beats with a desire to make sure that any heart beating is protected.                              {time}  2100  I heard a comedian on television this last night saying something about, ``Yeah, so many years ago I had an abortion because it is my choice,'' something of that order. The audience cheered and clapped. I thought, ``A comedian?'' My heart wasn't angry. My heart just broke for that child.  As my friend knows, my wife and I, our first child came 8 to 10 weeks early. They tried for 3 days to stop the contractions, and after 3 days it was clear our daughter was coming. Back then, it was far enough back that we really didn't know if we were going to be able to keep her.  The first day she was there in Tyler, we were losing her. I had had malpractice cases as a judge that involved the condition. I know for preemies they don't like to give too much extra oxygen because you get to 100 percent and it may cause blindness. It is a condition called retrolental fibroplasia. The retina has not matured enough, and in the presence of oxygen, the blood vessels constrict and cause little fibers to come out and separate from the back of the wall. I knew all of that. I knew all about what was going on.  When the pediatrician came in and tried to intubate our child, tried to get that tube in--he didn't intubate a lot of children. He was just a wonderful, caring doctor. They lost her three times. The monitors went off. They got her going again, tried to get the tube in so they could get more oxygen to her little, undeveloped lungs. He didn't know I was sitting there in the nursing station watching. It was like a horror movie. I was sorry I ever started watching it, but I could not leave until I found out how it came out.  Also, they were praying for my child and the doctor's hands and what he was doing. But he finally got her intubated and came out sweating profusely because he had that little child's life in his hands. I had already held our child. I could hold her in one hand. I was careful and preferred to use two.  But anyway, he made clear we needed to take her either to Dallas or At that time--now all kids, if they have to go somewhere, they go to Dallas, instate, from  But at that time, I said: Well, which is more successful?  He said: It seems like the survival rate in Shreveport right now is a little better.  I don't know what it is now.  But I said: Let's get her to  So I wasn't sure. Kathy had to stay in the hospital there in Tyler, but I followed the ambulance and made sure she was checked in.  When I got over there, the doctor, I could understand why they had such a good survival rate. His name is He, with one of the nurses, got me over to our daughter's isolette. It is open-air. They had the monitors hooked up. They had the halo around her head piping in extra oxygen.  He said: Please sit down here on this stool.  He said: Now, you are probably aware that her eyes are not functioning properly. She can't recognize you when she opens her eyes and tries to see, but she knows your voice. She has been listening to your voice for months. She knows you, and she is comforted by your voice because she knows you. So you sit here, and you talk to her, and you caress her little arms and face and talk to her, and you will do some good for her.  They said: We have a 2-hour limit on how long you can sit here, and then you have to take a break for a couple hours and you can come back.  The last thing Kathy had asked was that I do anything I could to help our little girl. So there I sat, and I caressed her little face.  The danger of a child born prematurely, the number one danger is the lungs not being properly developed to get enough air in to actually keep the child alive. So her breathing from the first moment of birth was very, very shallow, and her heart rate was erratic, very fast. You could see it on the monitors, very shallow, very fast, and very erratic breathing and heartbeat. But she had a heartbeat.  As the gentleman from Iowa has said many times, my friend, and Janet said many times: Gee, you walk in a room. You see a body not moving. You check to see if there is a heartbeat; and if there is a heartbeat, you know you have to call an ambulance. You have to do everything you can to try to keep that person living, which is, again, the principle behind the Heartbeat bill.  Her heart was beating just so very fast and erratically, but when I was playing with her little hand, she took her whole hand, it wrapped around the end of my finger, and she held on tight. It was a tight grip. This was a child whose lungs are not working so well, eyes aren't working that great, but she was holding on and holding tight.  I was there for 3 or 4 hours before Tsing came back. When he came back, he said: Have you looked up at the monitors?  I had not for a couple of hours or so. I looked up, and the breathing was very shallow, but it was no longer erratic. It had a regular beat, a regular rhythm to it. The heartbeat was still very fast, but it was not erratic. It was a regular heartbeat with a regular pattern.  Tsing said: She is drawing strength from you. She is drawing life from you.  I can tell you, when you know this little child is drawing life from you and strength from you, you don't want to leave. Finally, after 8 hours, the nurses and the doctor came over.  They said: You have to leave. It has been 8 hours.  I said: I don't want to leave. The monitors show she has a regular heartbeat, regular breathing. I don't want to leave.  They said: You were supposed to leave 6 hours ago. You have to leave now. Go somewhere.  I did leave and went to McDonald's. My heart was up there with our daughter, and so I rear-ended a lady right there by McDonald's. The policeman was very nice, and the lady that lived there in Shreveport was extremely nice, but I couldn't wait to get back to our child.  She is extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary in every way, one of the top artists in the world. She was chosen to be one of the first 12 artists that Swatch Art Peace Hotel dedicated to the arts in Shanghai, one of the first 12 they selected to live there as artist-in-residence from all over the world. She was one of the first 12--amazing talent.  I think about the talent of so many, 60 million children. Every one of them had some kind of gift, and they are gone.  I have appreciated the National Right to Life when I was in college, when I was out of college, and when I was a prosecutor after law school. When I was a practicing lawyer, local businessman, my own firm, I was elected a judge, I never wavered in my appreciation of the National Right to  I want to make sure that people understand, we also have a Texas Right to It is not National Right to It is its own organization.  I have talked to the The Grahams that head up the Texas Right to Life, God bless them. They have done incredible work, but they make clear, we don't care whose bill it is, we don't care who came up with the idea; if there is any bill that will prevent even one precious life from being aborted, that life being saved and allowed a chance to be loved and to love and to not be aborted, then they are on board.  That is the way everybody I knew who is pro-choice, meaning you choose[[Page H778]]to live, that is the way I thought everybody was. So it has been quite an awakening to be here in Washington and to have any groups, especially one that I put up on a pedestal for so many years, for decades now, that says: Our board doesn't support a bill.  We have a bill, the pain-capable bill, heck, any bill--pain-capable? Yes, sign me on--that saves 5 to 15 percent of abortions, count me in; I am there.  Then, National Right to Life may save 80, 90 percent of the children who are being killed; count me in. I am in.  I thought that is where everybody would be. I don't know. I really don't understand. If it is a turf battle, it wasn't our idea. Why is it that any group doesn't support saving an additional life?  I do read the Bible every day. I made that promise I would read the Bible, and I do that. I have just gone, again, through some of the Old Testament books, and when I read the prophets talk about how evil a society was, they said that this king did right in the eyes of the Lord, and this king did evil in the eyes of the When the writer wants to really illustrate the point that a society had become so evil that it was an abomination to God, they would point out that they sacrificed their children on the altar of an idol.  I remember reading that as a kid, and I thought: What could be worse than that? I just cannot imagine a parent being willing to sacrifice their child. I can imagine my parents, lots of parents, fighting to the death to protect their child, but I just couldn't imagine how that could happen in these Old Testament days.  Then I came to realize we have been doing that since the seventies. We have been sacrificing these children who could survive on their own on the altar of individual choice: I am too busy to do other things. I don't have time for a child when there are parents begging for children to adopt.  So I just appreciate so much my friend speaking up on behalf of the unborn. We have heard from our Democratic friends so many times that a society is judged by the way they protect those who cannot protect themselves and help those who cannot protect themselves. Clearly, there is nobody more innocent and more in need of protection than a child not quite born that someone wants to kill.  So I appreciate my friend's illumination of what is going on. I thank him for his efforts not just tonight, but every day.  ",CREC-2018-02-05-pt1-PgH774.txt,1801,CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995 REFORM ACT,2018.0,5.0,February

Mr.Speaker, H.2504, introduced by my Maine colleagues, Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin, is a bipartisan effort to right a bipartisan wrong.

GENEVIEVE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ESTABLISHMENT ACT,2018.0,5.0,February
277,topic-id,1798,"Mr.President, I would like to raise a very important issue that is impacting our veterans population. That issue is the systematic denial of these veterans' Second Amendment rights. This comes up in discussions with Iowa veterans, and I have candidly discussed this issue before on the Senate floor.  Today, I am introducing bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by Senator Manchin, called the Veterans' Second Amendment Rights Restoration Act of 2018. This bill is being introduced to solve the problem of denying these rights to veterans.  The legislation is about the fidelity of the Constitution and about the fidelity of the Bill of It is also about due process and fairness for veterans. What this is not about, I want to make clear, is allowing anyone to purchase a firearm who is prohibited to do so under current law or regulations. I want it to be very clear right off the bat so that no one misinterprets this as some effort to let people own firearms who would normally be prohibited.  This legislation is needed because a very disturbing trend has occurred in the past decade. The Veterans Health Administration has been reporting veterans to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System--the national gun ban list--just because these veterans have been determined by the VA to be veterans who require a fiduciary to administer benefit payments. This is a pretty simple proposition that denies veterans their Second Amendment rights. It is that simple, as I just said. A fiduciary's administering benefit payments to a veteran could and does lead to that veteran's being denied Second Amendment rights. Once on the gun list, a veteran is outlawed from owning or possessing firearms.  It is crucial to note that the regulations that the Veterans Health Administration is relying on are from way back in the 1970s. It predates even the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and is long before the Supreme Court held the Second Amendment to be a fundamental, constitutional right. These regulations grant limited authority to determine incompetence only in the context of financial matters.  The regulation reads like this: ``Rating agencies have sole authority to make official determinations of competency or incompetency for purposes of: insurance and . . . disbursement of benefits.''  There is nothing wrong with that language, but it is that language that leads to the problems that veterans have with their Second Amendment rights. From this language, it is clear that the core regulatory authority applies to matters of competency for financial purposes. It has nothing to do with regulating who can purchase firearms, but that is exactly what is happening. Veterans are losing their Second Amendment rights because they have people managing their checkbooks. It is that simple. If you cannot handle your finances, you lose your Second Amendment rights.[[Page S654]]  Everybody wants to know how this is happening. Federal law requires that before a person is reported to a gun ban list, he be determined to be a ``mental defective.'' The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive created a regulation to define what ``mental defective'' means. It includes, among other requirements, that a person is a danger to self or others. The VA has taken the position that this Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulation can then be made to fit within its own preexisting regulatory structure for assigning a fiduciary, thus requiring that name be put on the gun ban list.  The intent and purpose between these two regulations is entirely different. On the one hand, the VA regulation is designed to appoint a fiduciary. On the other hand, the ATF regulation is designed to regulate firearms. That is a great big, huge distinction. The level of mental impairment that justifies taking away the right to possess and own firearms must rest at a severe and substantial level--a level at which the mere possession of a firearm would constitute a danger to self or others. That decision is never made by the VA before submitting names to this gun ban list. As such, imposing a gun ban is a harsh result that could sweep up veterans who are fully capable of appropriately operating a firearm.  It gets worse.  When veterans are then placed on that gun ban list, they must prove that they are not dangerous to the public in order to get their names removed from that list. That dangerousness standard is much higher than the mere assignment of a fiduciary. Thus, veterans are subjected to a more rigorous and more demanding evidentiary standard to get their names off the gun ban list than the Federal Government must prove to put their names on that list. We ought to all agree that is patently unfair. I also believe that it is unconstitutional. When dealing with a fundamental, constitutional right like the one protected by the Second Amendment, at the very minimum, the government ought to be held to the same standard as we the people.  We owe it to our veterans to fix this problem. As of December 31, 2016, the Veterans Health Administration reported 167,815 veterans to the gun ban list for having been assigned a fiduciary. That is 167,815 out of 171,083 or another way of saying it is 98 percent of all names reported.  It is important to note that since the VA reports names to the gun ban list merely when a fiduciary is assigned to that veteran, not one of those names has been reported because a veteran has been deemed to be a public danger. Accordingly, not all veterans reported to the gun ban list should be on it.  On May 18, 2016, I debated this very issue on the Senate floor with Senator He said, ``I do not dispute what the Senator from Iowa suggested, that some of these veterans may be suffering from a mental illness not serious enough to disqualify them from owning a firearm, but certainly many of them do.''  Then Senator Durbin said, ``Let me just concede at the outset that reporting 174,000 names goes too far, but eliminating 174,000 names goes too far.''  I am pleased that Senator Durbin acknowledged that many of the names supplied by the VA on the gun ban list do not pose a danger and should be removed.  I thank his staff for working with my staff during this process.  The essential question then is, How do we go about fixing it the right way?  I believe my legislation does just that. This legislation adds a new step before the VA can report names to a gun ban list. The step requires that once a fiduciary is assigned, the VA must first find the veteran to be a danger to self or to the public before taking away his firearm. That is the same standard that the veteran must satisfy currently in order to get his name off the gun ban list.  My legislation also provides constitutional due process. Specifically, it shifts the burden of proof to the government to prove a veteran is dangerous before taking away firearms. Currently, the entire burden of proof is on the veteran to prove that he or she is not dangerous. When a constitutional right is involved, the burden must always be on the government.  My bill also creates an option for the veteran to seek legal redress via an administrative board or the Federal court system. The veteran is in control. It provides an avenue for every veteran already on that gun ban list to get his name removed. That last point is important to note.  My bill does not automatically remove every veteran from the list, which was a concern Senator Durbin raised previously when we debated this issue. It does require the VA to provide notice to every veteran on the list of his right to go through the new process to have his name removed. Should a veteran choose to do that, the protections, the process, the procedure, and the standards set forth in my bill would then apply to him. Every veteran is free to apply for relief, and every veteran will be treated equally under my bill. Of course, that is the fair thing to do. That is the constitutionally sound way to manage this process.  The bill does provide authority for the government to seek an emergency order if it believes a veteran is a serious and imminent risk to self or to others. That was a suggestion by Senator Durbin--to provide for a short-term safety mechanism when the situation is too urgent to wait for a judge to evaluate all of the facts.  The bill also retains a mechanism for the VA to systematically refer veterans to the National Instant Criminal Background Check This was another of Senator Durbin's main concerns. A simpler bill passed the House of Representatives last year that is similar to the amendment I tried to offer and that Senator Durbin objected to in the year 2016. It would, simply, stop the VA from referring veterans to the gun ban list without first finding them a danger to self and others. However, it did not set up any system to make that happen. The argument is that this puts veterans using the VA in the same boat as everybody else. Of course, I am sympathetic to that argument, but the legislation I am introducing today is a good faith effort to overcome objections that have prevented action on this important issue in the past.  My bill solves a problem that has existed for many years: denying veterans their Second Amendment rights. Veterans should not be subject to a harsher standard than what the government is subject to. Veterans deserve full due process protections when their constitutional rights are at stake. That is the core of this legislation.  The regulatory process at the back end to remove a veteran from the gun ban list is simply moved to the front end; that is, the Federal Government must first prove that a veteran is dangerous before taking away firearms. This is the same standard applied to nonveterans.  This fix will not change existing firearms laws. Felons are still prohibited from owning firearms. Persons with domestic violence convictions are still prohibited. Persons adjudicated as mentally defective are still prohibited. Persons involuntarily committed are still prohibited. If my bill were to become law, every Federal firearm prohibition would still exist.  Again, the core of my bill simply requires the Federal Government to prove that a veteran is dangerous before taking away his or her firearms. That is the same standard our veterans must live by currently in order to remove their name from the gun ban list and get their guns back.  If we, the people, have to live under that standard, then, so should our Federal                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS653.txt,457,WESTERN AREA POWER ADMINISTRATION TRANSPARENCY ACT,2018.0,6.0,February

30,topic-id,1900,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, a little more than 3 months ago, you tasked the Committee on House Administration with a great responsibility, to undertake a comprehensive review of the training, policies, and mechanisms to guard against sexual harassment in the congressional workplace.                              {time}  1145  I believe that the legislation we are considering today, H.4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act, and, immediately following that, the House resolution, together, respond to this great task.  At the outset, I would like to thank the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, for his leadership on this issue and for the trust he placed on our committee to conduct this important review.  I would also like to thank and appreciate the work done by our Conference Chair, Cathy McMorris  I would also thank every member of the Committee on House Administration, particularly the ranking member, Mr.He has been a great friend and colleague over the last decade, and I appreciate being able to work closely on this issue with him.  Both the CAA Reform Act and the House resolution reflect the dedication and commitment of a bipartisan group of Members, including Representatives Byrne, Speier, Brooks, and Deutch, who want to ensure this institution remains worthy of the trust placed in it by the American people. I also want to thank Representatives DeSantis, Love, Comstock, and Chris Smith for their contributions to this bill.  As I have said previously and will state again, unequivocally, there is no place for sexual harassment, or any type of harassment, period, in the U.House of  It is no secret that the culture on Capitol Hill is unique. While there are hundreds of employing offices, we should all share the common goal of creating effective work environments--environments that are safe, productive, collegial, and, most importantly, responsive, responsive to the needs of our constituents and the public.  During our review, the committee held two hearings, three member listening sessions, a roundtable discussion with stakeholders, and meetings with victims and their advocates to examine how we could improve the workplace for everyone. We found the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to be outdated and in need of this comprehensive reform.  We found the House training programs to be inadequate in order to meet the needs of all House employees. Additionally, we found that our House policies and procedures are in need of change as they relate to sexual harassment in the workplace.  Last November, the House took the first step in addressing these issues by passing 630, a resolution that, among other things, requires all House employees to take annual, in-person antiharassment and antidiscrimination training. Passage of the CAA Reform Act is the logical next step.  The CAA Reform Act makes a number of reforms to the Congressional Accountability Act that will ensure its future effectiveness, including:  Reforming the dispute resolution process to establish procedures for initiating, investigating, and resolving alleged violations of part A, title II, of the CAA;  Ensuring all claims are filed in writing and are made under oath;  Requiring Members who have engaged in intentional discrimination to reimburse the Department of the Treasury;  Requiring the Office of Compliance, the OOC, to report every 6 months of a calendar year to Congress, and to publish on their website the awards and settlements from the previous year;  Directing the OOC to conduct a climate survey of the legislative branch every 2 years;  Directing the OOC to establish a permanent record retention program;  Expanding the definition of covered employees to include unpaid interns, fellows, and detailees; and  Clarifying certain commissions, such as the Helsinki Commission, are covered by the Congressional Accountability Act and providing the process for disposing of claims.  These are just a few of the reforms that the CAA Reform Act makes.  I am proud of the work of this committee and our bipartisan group of Members who have worked on this so diligently over the last several months.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I will place this letter into the committee report and into      the Congressional Record during consideration of the measures      on the House floor.

However, in order to      expedite Floor consideration of these measures, the Committee      on Ethics will forgo action on both measures.       We believe that discharging the Committee on Ethics from      further consideration of H.4924 and 724 will serve      in the best interest of the House of Representatives to      ensure their swift consideration. It is our mutual      understanding that forgoing action on[[Page H804]]     H.4924 and 724 will not prejudice the Committee on      Ethics with respect to appointment of conferees or any future      jurisdictional claim over subject matter contained in this or      similar legislation.

45,topic-id,219,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.DeSantis).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, when news broke that there had been a series of secret sexual harassment payments paid for on behalf of Members of Congress by tax dollars, I think a lot of Americans, even by the low standards that they have for this body, were shocked to hear that. And it was almost as if the rules were set up to incentivize bad behavior by a Member because Members could harass people and they wouldn't be personally liable for it, and they could keep it all secret.  This had to change, and I applaud Chairman Harper for leading on this bill. And I am happy that the provisions of my bill have been adopted in this because I think it is important. Taxpayers should not bail Members of Congress out for misconduct, and this bill fixes that and makes them personally liable.  We also need a full accounting of any payments that are being made with tax dollars. This bill does that. We have to protect identities of victims.  I think we are making a step in the right direction. I think this starts to foster a culture of respect on Capitol  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I thank Chairman Harper for his efforts.

53,topic-id,4535,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to discuss the background and need for this legislation.  Accounts of sexual harassment revealed in the private sector last fall prompted former and current Members of Congress as well as congressional staff to disclose accounts of sexual harassment in Moreover, current and former Members and staff were critical of Congress' policies and procedures responding to sexual harassment claims. Criticism included, but was not limited to, the lack of awareness regarding sexual harassment generally in Congressional offices, the lack of mandatory sexual harassment awareness training; the lack of support provided to victims of sexual harassment, and the ineffectiveness of certain aspects of the dispute resolution process set out under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA) as it related to sexual harassment. Reports about the use of taxpayer dollars to settle sexual harassment claims in the past raised additional concerns about the lack of transparency in the process. The accounts of sexual harassment and criticism of the process revealed that it was not only timely, but important Congress review the employment and workplace policies and processes included in the CAA as well as those policies internal to House offices.  To that end, on November 3, 2017, the Speaker of the House of Representatives tasked the Committee on House Administration (Committee) to conduct a review of the ``existing training, policies, and mechanisms to guard against and report sexual harassment.'' The Speaker further ``instructed the Committee to be as thorough as possible,'' and to incorporate Member ideas and feedback.  The Committee responded and its review was methodical. On November 14, 2017, the Committee held its first hearing titled ``Preventing Sexual Harassment in the Congressional Workplace.'' The hearing identified: (1) the gaps in the House's training, policies, and procedures; and (2) solutions to address the gaps. Testifying at the hearing were Representatives Jackie Speier and Bradley Byrne in addition to Barbara Childs Wallace, Chair, Board of Directors, Office of Compliance; and Gloria Lett, Counsel, Office of House Employment The witnesses were unified in their recommendation the House should implement a mandatory training program.  On November 29, 2017, the House of Representatives responded to the calls for mandatory training by passing 630. 630 requires all House employees, including interns, fellows, and detailees, to participate in a mandatory annual training program. In addition, the resolution required all House offices to post a statement of employee rights and protections under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA). The resolution also required the Committee to promulgate regulations within 30 days to implement the House of Representatives' training and education program, which it did on December 19, 2017. Mandatory training will begin on April 2, 2018.  On December 7, 2017, the Committee held a second hearing focused on the CAA and the need to reform certain provisions to ensure the adjudication process contemplated by the CAA protects the rights of all parties to the proceedings. The Committee took testimony from four experts, including Victoria Lipnic, Acting Chair, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; Susan Grundmann, Executive Director, Office of Compliance; Gloria Lett, Counsel, Office of House Counsel; and Dan Crowley, former General Counsel, Committee on House  The Committee also held a roundtable discussion with organizations reflecting the interests of both employees and employers to discuss best practices in preventing harassment and discrimination in the workplace. In addition, stakeholders discussed potential reforms to the CAA's dispute resolution process to protect employers and employees.  Congress passed the CAA in 1995 to bring Congress, the Architect of the Capitol, the U.Capitol Police, the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Attending Physician, and the Office of Compliance under the same employment and workplace safety laws and standards as the federal government and the private sector. The CAA incorporates the prohibitions against discrimination contained in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.2000e et seq.). In addition to incorporating employment and safety laws, the CAA establishes the adjudication process for resolving claims filed under the For discrimination claims, the adjudication process includes counseling, mediation, and either an administrative hearing overseen by the OOC or proceeding to federal court.  In addition to the dispute resolution process, the CAA authorizes remedies for successful claims of discrimination, including sex discrimination and harassment. The remedies are similar to those available under Title VII, with the exception of punitive damages. Successful claims under the CAA are paid from an account within the Department of Treasury of the United States authorized for the payment of awards and settlements under the Rule X of House Rules specifies that employing offices of the House may only enter into settlements providing for the payment of claims filed under the CAA only after receiving the approval of the Chair and Ranking Member of the  The CAA established the Office of Compliance (OOC) as the independent non-partisan agency to implement the adjudication process for claims filed under the The OOC is responsible for, among other things, to compile and publish statistics ``on the use of the Office by covered employees, including the number and type of contact made with the Office, on the reason for such contacts, on the number of covered employees who initiated proceedings with the Office under this chapter and the result of such proceedings and on the number of covered employees who filed a complaint, the basis for the complaint, and the action taken on the complaint.''  The CAA has not been comprehensively examined since its passage in 1995. The Committee's review revealed frustration and criticism of the initial stages of adjudication process as it related to sexual harassment claims; concerns with OOC's management policies, including its record management, and the need for additional reporting by the OOC beyond its current statutory obligations. Relatedly, the Committee believes there should be greater transparency around the use of the Settlement and Award account authorized under section 1415 for section 201(a) and 207 claims for discrimination and retaliation. Furthermore, the Committee believes in cases of harassment and discrimination where a Member of Congress' conduct is intentional, reimbursement to the Treasury account should be[[Page H811]]required. To that end, the Committee recommends the reforms contained in H.4924 to ensure the CAA's future effectiveness in preventing discrimination and harassment in the Congressional Workplace and adjudicating claims in a fair and expeditious manner.  The Committee found the current requirements for counseling and mediation to be ineffective and burdensome. Specifically, the Committee took testimony revealing the ``counseling phase'' was not counseling but more akin to claim intake. The Committee further found the mandated 30-day counseling period to be unnecessary. The Committee recommends eliminating the counseling phase altogether and replacing it with a more simplistic process. Under H.4924, proceedings set out under section 1401 are initiated as soon as a claim is filed. Relatedly, the Committee heard concerns about frivolous claims being filed under the CAA and potential abuses of the adjudication process. The Committee recommends strengthening the requirements for filing a claim under the CAA as well as imposing standards and responsibilities on all attorneys involved in a CAA proceeding similar to those found in Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil H.4924 requires claims filed under the CAA to be in writing and under oath. Moreover, attorneys involved in a CAA proceeding must ensure all filings with the OOC are made in a manner consistent with their ethical obligations in federal court.  In addition to concerns about the counseling phase, the Committee heard testimony criticizing mandatory mediation. The Committee agrees the mandate only prolongs a proceeding--particularly in cases where one party does not want to settle. The Committee recommends making mediation available when both parties agree that it is in their joint interest.  Apart from the reforms to counseling and mediation, the Committee recommends granting investigative authority to the OOC General The Committee supports incorporating a similar investigative process as is currently conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the private sector and executive branch. Given the OOC General Counsel already has investigative authority under the CAA in certain other claims, the Committee recommends extending limited investigative authority to claims, including those of discrimination and harassment. The Committee believes investigations early on will help facilitate the resolution of cases. The Committee further believes the OOC General Counsel should have limited subpoena authority during its investigation. However, this authority should not be construed to be any broader than the authority granted to hearing officers pursuant to section 1405(f). Further, as noted in the text of H.4924, the Committee believes subpoenas should only be issued as a last resort and primarily to keep the investigation on schedule.  As noted above, during the Committee's review, reports surfaced of settlements of sexual harassment claims involving taxpayer dollars, including the use of the Member Representational Allowance (MRA). The Committee heard from Members, constituents and the public that taxpayer dollars should not be available to settle claims of sexual harassment. While the Committee agrees, it recognizes victims need to be made whole. Not victims a second time.  To that end, H.4924 requires a Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress), a Senator, or a former Member of the House of Representatives or Senator to reimburse the Department of Treasury account authorized under section 1415 for certain settlements and awards. H.4924 sets out a structure to compel reimbursement if voluntary reimbursement is not made.  The Committee is mindful that personal liability for employment law claims does not exist in federal law and has worked to strike a balance between protecting taxpayers from being responsible for bad actions conducted by elected officials, protecting the due process rights of those accused, and not making the provision so broad as to discourage the settlement of meritorious claims.  With this in mind, the Committee intends the reimbursement obligation to be triggered only when three conditions are met: (1) the claimant alleges (and, unless the claim is settled, ultimately proved to the trier of fact) that the Member or Senator personally engaged in an intentional act of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation with animus covered by section (d)(1)(B); (2) the alleged act resulted in a settlement or award for the claimant; and (3) payment is made from the section 1415 account to compensate the claimant for the specific claim requiring reimbursement under this section. If in contention, the trier of fact should make an express finding, separate from the underlying claim, that the Member or Senator engaged in an intentional act of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation covered by section (d)(1)(B) with animus.  A reimbursement obligation is not triggered if the claimant does not allege an intentional act of harassment or discrimination or retaliation committed by a Member or Senator with animus and covered by this section. For example, the Committee does not intend the reimbursement obligation to be triggered if an act of discrimination or harassment was alleged against a supervising employee of a congressional office, such as the chief of staff. The provision would also not apply in the case of an omission, such as a failure to properly supervise an employee with hiring authority. The provision would not apply in the case of a disparate impact or other theory of unintentional discrimination. The provision would not be triggered if the claimant alleges a violation occurred but does not name a Member or Senator as the individual who committed an act leading to the violation. In the case of a discrimination claim, the provision would not apply if there was no discriminatory animus on the part of the Member or  Concerned with its day-to-day management, Congress requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to audit OOC in 2004. The Committee has similar concerns today. H.4924 directs the Government Accountability Office to update its 2004 review of OOC's management practices. In addition to its management operations, the Committee is also concerned with the lack of record retention policies adopted by H.4924 requires OOC to establish a permanent record retention program to ensure that general questions about OOC case management may be answered in a timely manner.  Relatedly, the Committee's review brought to light the use of the Department of Treasury account established in Section 1415 to pay for the settlement of claims including claims of sexual harassment. In addition to settlements and awards constructed under the CAA, it was brought to the Committee's attention that the Member Representational Allowance (MRA) was used to settle claims of sexual harassment, including for claims filed under the While not specifically prohibited by statute or by the Committee's Member Handbook, the use of the MRA for these purposes is of concern and is addressed in separate legislation.  The Committee is concerned with the use of taxpayer dollars to settle claims, particularly for claims of discrimination and harassment. H.4924 directs the OOC to report within 30 days on all settlements and awards under the CAA in which public funds were used over the last 20 years. This includes any House or Senate account. The OOC is directed to identify the claim, the award or settlement and the source of funding. In putting together its report, the OOC should take care not to disclose any identifying information about any party to a legally binding agreement or proceeding who has an expectation of privacy. The Committee understands there may be victims to agreements which may be unenforceable. To that end, the Committee recommends working with the new Office of Employee Advocacy authorized in separate legislation.  Notwithstanding OOC's responsibility to issue its comprehensive report looking backward, H.4924 directs the OOC to report to Congress every six months on the payment of awards and settlements for claims filed under Part A, title II of the CAA, the name of the employing office, the amount of the award or settlement, and in cases where a Member or Senator is responsible for reimbursement--whether the Member is in compliance with the reimbursement obligation.  Notwithstanding its new reporting requirements, the Committee takes this opportunity to clarify its expectation of OOC's current reporting requirements. The Committee encourages the OOC to include in its existing reporting the following: (1) number of Complaints listed by their protected categories under the CAA (ie. race, sex, national origin, religion, disability, age) as opposed to title VII; (2) summary of general information requests listed by the groups of people contacting the OOC (ie. number of covered employees, number of public inquiries, media, union, employing offices); (3) the specific information requested by protected category for issues under section 201 and 207 (race/color, sex/gender, disability, age, national origin, retaliation, religion); (4) the number of requests for counseling and mediation broken down by their protected classes; and (5) workplace issues raised with the OOC (ADA, compensation, demotion, disparate treatment, equal pay, harassment/hostile work environment, promotion, overtime, etc).  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a section-by-section analysis of this legislation:                 Section-by-Section of the Legislation            Title I--Reform of Dispute Resolution Procedures  Subtitle A--Reform of Procedures for Initiation, Investigations and                           Resolution of Claims       101 (a). Description of Procedures Available for      Consideration of Alleged Section 101 sets out the      procedures for initiating, investigating and resolving      alleged violation(s) of Part A, Title II of the Congressional      Accountability Act (CAA). The procedures require a covered      employee to file a claim with the Office of Compliance[[Page H812]]     (OOC). Once a claim is filed, an investigation is initiated      by the OOC General The section specifies at the      conclusion of the investigation, the covered employee may      proceed to a hearing before the OOC hearing officer in two      instances: (1) the investigation results in a finding of      reasonable cause a violation occurred, or (2) the General      Counsel is unable to determine whether reasonable cause      exists on the merits of the claim. The procedures allow for a      covered employee to file in federal court within 45 days of      filing a claim. The decision to file in federal court stops      the investigation and any further ability to seek an      investigation. The section further authorizes a covered      employee to file in federal court within 90 days upon      receiving a right to sue letter from the OOC General      Finally, the section specifies that any party may retain      counsel to protect their respective interests. The section      also imposes FRCP Rule 11 obligations on all parties to the      proceedings including OHEC, the new Office of Employee      Advocate and any party that intervenes on behalf of a party.       101 (b). Conforming The section makes      conforming amendments.       102 (a). Reform of Process for Initiation of      Section 102 specifies a claim must be filed with      the OOC to initiate the process. The claim must be in writing      and under oath or affirmation. (The bill eliminates mandatory      counseling and mediation). The employing office is notified      once a claim is filed. The section also sets out a special      notification requirement to Members whose conduct is the      focus of a section 201(a) or 207 allegation. The special      notification requirement specifies OOC must notify the Member      of the potential repayment obligation associated with claim      and the opportunity to intervene in the proceedings. The      section directs the OOC to establish an electronic reporting      and tracking system that will be used to report and track      claims. The system will be accessible by both parties, taking      into consideration the covered employee's need for      confidentiality. In addition, the section imposes a reporting      requirement on OOC to provide the Committees of jurisdiction      with semi-annual reports on the effectiveness of the system      to facilitate the resolution of cases. Under section 102, all      claims must be filed within 180 days of alleged violation.      The section reaffirms the ability of a covered employee to:      contact OOC or any other office (i.e. Office of Employee      Advocate) for information; refer a matter to the respective      Committees on Ethics; as well as to file in federal court.       103 (a). Investigations of Claims by General      Section 103 authorizes the OOC General Counsel to initiate an      investigation of a claim under Part A, Title II once a claim      is filed. The OOC General Counsel has subpoena authority to      compel production of documents and testimony from witnesses      during the pendency of the investigation. The subpoena      authority is consistent with existing subpoena authority held      by the hearing officers under Section 1405(f). Subpoenas may      be enforced in same manner as provided in Section 1405 (f).      The OOC General Counsel is required to make one of three      findings at the end of the investigation: (1) a finding of      reasonable cause that a violation of Part A, Title II      occurred; (2) a finding that there is no reasonable cause to      believe a violation of Part A, Title II occurred; or (3) a      finding indicating the General Counsel cannot determine cause      based on the facts. In the event there is a finding no      reasonable cause exists to believe a violation occurred, the      General Counsel will issue a letter to the covered employee      authorizing their right to sue in federal court. The section      authorizes the General Counsel to transmit the findings to      the parties. With respect to section 201(a) and/or 207 claims      involving Member conduct, the General Counsel is authorized      to transmit the report to the Committees on The      section authorizes the General Counsel to recommend mediation      to the parties at any time. The General Counsel has 90 days      to investigate and issue findings. The General Counsel can      extend investigation for an additional 30 days with notice to      the parties.       103 (b). Conforming This section makes      conforming amendments.       104. Availability of Mediation during      Section 104 allows the parties to request mediation while the      investigation is proceeding. The request for mediation must      be made by both parties and may be for a period of 30 days.      The parties may jointly agree to extend for another 30 days.      The section allows the parties to be separated during      mediation if requested by the covered employee.                         Part B--Other Reforms       111. Requiring Members of Congress to Reimburse      Treasury for Amounts Paid as Settlements and Awards in Cases      of Acts Committed Personally by The section requires      Members of Congress (including former Members who were in      office at the time of the allegation) to repay the Settlement      and Award Account authorized under section 1415 of the      Members are responsible for repayment in cases in which the      allegation of an act or violation under section 201(a)      (discrimination and harassment) and section 207 (retaliation      resulting from a 201(a) violation) involves a Member      personally. The section authorizes the appropriate Committees      to establish a plan to withhold compensation if the account      is not repaid within 90 days. If the account is not repaid      within 180 days, section 111 authorizes the transfer of funds      from the Member's Thrift Savings The section clarifies      that spouses' rights are not applicable when TSP is accessed.      In the event, the Member is no longer receiving compensation      (i.e. former Member), the section authorizes withholding      annuities and transferring amount to the account. The section      reiterates a Member's right to intervene in his or her      personal capacity during mediation, hearing or civil action      to protect the Member's interest. The section ensures the      covered employee is not unduly burdened in depositions      resulting from the intervention. The Committees on House      Administration and Senate Rules are charged with promulgating      regulations to implement this section.       112. Automatic Referral to Congressional Ethics      Committees of allegations involving Members and Senior      Section 112 authorizes an automatic referral to the House      Committee on Ethics (and Senate Select Committee on Ethics)      with respect to claims filed under section 201(a) (harassment      and discrimination) and/or 207 involving Member and senior      staff conduct. The referral occurs when there is: an order to      pay an award or settlement (including agreements resulting      from mediation outlined in section 104); a final decision of      a hearing officer; a final decision by the Board under      Section 406(e); and a final decision in a civil action. The      section authorizes the Committees on Ethics to have access to      records and information relating to any investigation,      hearing, or settlement. The section prohibits the Committee      on Ethics from releasing the identity or position of an      individual making allegation.       113. Availability of Remote Work Assignment or Paid      Leave of Absence during Pendency of The section      allows a covered employee to work remotely if requested. If a      covered employee's responsibilities require on-site presence,      an employee may request paid leave. The section prohibits an      employing office from using requests as a method of      retaliation. The section protects any collective bargaining      agreements that are in place.       114. Modification of Rules on The      section makes technical changes to sections 1416(a) and (b)      regarding confidentiality as it relates to filing a claim and      the subsequent investigation as well as information relating      to mediation. The section includes a rule of construction      indicating nothing in the section precludes a covered      employee or employing office from disclosing information      related to a claim.       115. Reimbursement by Other Employing Offices of the      Legislative Branch of Payments of Certain Awards and      Section 115 requires the Legislative Branch      agencies under the CAA to repay the Settlement and Award      account as result of awards and settlements issued under      section 201(a). Repayment shall be made from the operating      expenses of agency within 180 days. The section directs the      OOC to establish procedures and timetables for repayment.         Title II--Improving Operations of Office of Compliance       201. Semiannual Reporting on Allegations, Awards, and      In addition to their current reporting      requirements, section 201 requires the OOC to report every      six months of a calendar year to Congress and to publish on      their website the awards and settlements from the previous      year. The report to Congress must include: the employing      office; the provision of Part A, Title II that was the      subject of the allegation or violation; and the amount of the      award or settlement resulting from an allegation or      violation. In cases where the Member is personally      responsible for repayment, the report will identify whether      the Member has complied with repayment obligations. In      addition, the section requires the OOC to submit a report      within 30 days of enactment on all payments made with public      funds, including MRAs, used to settle section 201(a) claims.      The report is to include the amount paid and the source of      funding.       202.

247,topic-id,832,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Buck) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  I rise today to debate this rule, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017, and the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018.  H.772 would amend the labeling requirements for nutrition information displayed by restaurants and other retail food establishments. This measure would unnecessarily complicate and further delay the implementation of nutrition labeling requirements established by the Affordable Care  In what can only be described as a rather astounding attempt to avoid good sense, this bill will make calorie and nutrition information less accessible and less useful to consumers at a time when we are spending $147 billion annually on healthcare measures related to chronic illnesses that are directly tied to obesity. Consumers need more access to this information, not less.  The second measure, H.1153, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017, would introduce some of the high fees that borrowers faced leading up to the 2008 mortgage and financial crisis. This bill would roll back important home-buyer protection reforms, taking us back to the days when the true cost of a loan could be obscured in mortgage documents to the detriment of home buyers everywhere.  The third measure, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018, would direct the Federal Reserve Board to triple the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion, allowing even larger banking institutions to use greater amounts of debt to finance acquisitions, seemingly ignoring the lessons[[Page H792]]from the previous financial disaster that we continue to climb out of to this very day.  Indeed, these Financial Services bills would weaken and politicize the policies created after the financial crisis to identify and guard against systemic risk in our financial system; and will allow even larger bank holding companies to leverage themselves with debt when financing the purchase of other banks.  Reviewing this legislation, I had to ask myself: Are the memories of my Republican colleagues really so short that they do not remember the complete breakdown of our financial system only a few short years ago?  Let me remind my friends across the aisle that the financial crisis of 2008 was the worst economic downturn America has faced since the Great Four million homes went through foreclosure and 9 million Americans lost their jobs.  Yet, instead of supporting efforts to ensure a financial collapse of such magnitude does not happen again, the majority has, instead, chosen to weaken the very protections put in place to prevent it.  With this in mind, we are left with two questions of equal importance: On the one hand, why are the Republicans so set on weakening much-needed and proven economic protections and making it harder for people to knowingly buy healthy food? And, secondly, why are they doing so now?  Mr.Speaker, the government runs out of funding this Thursday at midnight. We, once again, are forced to stare down the very real possibility of another shutdown because the Republican leadership either cannot or will not govern in a mature and reliable manner. Instead, our country is forced to lurch from continuing resolution to continuing resolution for no discernible reason. I think we are coming up on continuing resolution number 5.  Rather than taking the time to address their ever-present inability to govern responsibly, we are here today to debate evidence of that very inability, namely, the three bills we will be asked to vote on shortly.  It strikes me as odd, and is certainly frustrating, that I must, once again, remind the majority that we have yet to pass a budget agreement that provides an equal increase to both defense and nondefense spending.  Caveat right there. Later today, when we take up the CR, it is likely going to be said by a lot of people that our primary responsibility is to provide for the defense of this Nation, and I agree 100 percent. But that does not ignore the secondary responsibility of promoting the general welfare, and there are a variety of measures that are unattended and need to be attended. I might add, military people, veterans, and others find themselves in need of those particular services that are unattended as well.  We have yet to enact disaster aid so that our fellow Americans in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and southwest Louisiana can recover from the devastating hurricanes and wildfires.                              {time}  1030  We have yet to provide funding, and we will be talking about that a little bit later in our previous question request. We haven't provided funding for what we all know is the urgent opioid crisis. We have yet to protect hardworking Americans' pensions, and we have yet to see a serious proposal from Republican leadership to protect DREAMers and those whose temporary protected status will soon run out.

250,topic-id,308,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, every day, more than 115 Americans die from an opioid overdose. In 2016, the opioid epidemic claimed more American lives than car accidents and even breast cancer.  In order to tackle this growing crisis, we need to pass legislation that invests in effective solutions. Even President Donald John Trump agrees. Last year, he said: ``It is a national emergency. We are going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort, and a lot of money on the opioid crisis.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, we have not spent a lot of time, a lot of effort, or a lot of money on this crisis. Instead, the President and the Republican Party spent most of last year trying to take[[Page H793]]away healthcare from millions of Americans and passing a tax cut for billionaires and corporations.

311,topic-id,585,"Mr.President, I rise in support of the nomination of Andrei Iancu to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.Patent and Trademark  USPTO is critically important. It is a critically important agency that stands at the crossroads of innovation, technology, and property rights. It is tasked with ensuring that our laws properly compensate ingenuity and invention, while at the same time stopping bad actors who seek to game the system.  Intellectual property has been a focus of mine throughout my entire Senate service. Early in my tenure, I authored the Hatch-Waxman Act, which made possible the rise of the modern generic drug industry. More recently, I played a key role in the America Invents Act, which rebalanced our patent system to ensure high-quality patents and reduce abusive litigation. Just last Congress, I authored the Defend Trade Secrets Act, a landmark piece of legislation that created a federal private cause of action to prevent trade secret theft and other nefarious activity.  I have also led the charge against patent trolling--the practice of buying up patents solely for the purpose of bringing lawsuits--and argued forcefully that forum shopping in patent cases must not be allowed. I was gratified to see the Supreme Court last year strike a blow against abusive forum shopping in its TC Heartland decision.  In my remaining months here in this body, I intend to continue ahead full-bore on intellectual property reform. Digital music licensing, royalties for visual artists, and online filtering are just a few of my intellectual property priorities for this year.  Given my focus on intellectual property, I take a keen interest in the Patent and Trademark Office and in the individual selected to run the office. I have to say that I couldn't be more pleased by President Trump's nomination of Andrei Iancu to be the next USPTO  Andrei has an extensive background in patent litigation. He is a partner at Irell & Manella, one of the Nation's leading intellectual property law firms. For 6 years, he was the firm's managing partner. Andrei has represented clients across the spectrum, from tech companies to drug manufacturers to aerospace firms. He understands all sides of patent law because he has litigated all sides.  In an area fraught with allegiances to particular industries or groups, Andrei can bring a neutral, unbiased perspective because he has already had to approach issues from so many different angles.  Andrei has been named a leader in intellectual property and patent law by Chambers USA every year for the last 11 years. He has been named attorney of the year by California Lawyer and lawyer of the year by the Los Angeles Business His bona fides are top notch. I have full confidence that Andrei will make an outstanding USPTO  Subject-matter eligibility, PTAB reform, and continued controversies over forum shopping are just a handful of the issues that will soon be coming across his desk. There will also be questions about fee setting, fee diversion, and IT modernization. As I move forward on my intellectual property priorities this year, I look forward to working with Andrei and his future colleagues at USPTO to make our patent and trademark system the best it can possibly be.  We owe it to the American people to ensure that our intellectual property laws keep pace with our rapidly changing world. That has always been one of my chief focuses here in this body, and it will continue to be so throughout the rest of my term.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-05-pt1-PgS595-6.txt,1351,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017--Continued,2018.0,5.0,February
362,topic-id,736,"Mr.President, I would also like to take a couple of minutes to[[Page S596]]discuss a bill that I will be introducing with Senators Coons, Graham, and Whitehouse called the Clarify Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or the CLOUD It is a tremendously important bill that will help to solve the problems that have arisen in recent years with cross-border law enforcement requests.  The rise of email and cloud computing has put our data privacy laws on a collision course with the privacy laws of other countries. Information in emails or in the cloud can be stored on servers virtually anywhere in the world. This means that when law enforcement seeks access to such information, the information may be located in another country.  This state of affairs causes problems both for law enforcement and for email and cloud computing providers. It causes problems for law enforcement because warrants traditionally stop at the water's edge and because laws in other countries may prohibit disclosure to foreign law enforcement, and it causes problems for email and cloud computing providers because they find themselves caught between orders by U.law enforcement to disclose data in other countries and laws in those other countries that may forbid such disclosure.  The question of whether warrants issued to U.S.-based providers may require providers to disclose data stored in other countries is currently before the U.Supreme Court in the United States v. Microsoft case. Oral argument in the case will be heard later this month.  No matter how the Court rules, however, problems will remain. Either law enforcement will lack the ability to obtain in a timely manner email and documents in the cloud that are stored overseas or providers will find themselves caught between conflicting domestic and foreign laws.  The CLOUD Act creates a clear, workable framework to resolve these problems. The bill has four key components.  First, it authorizes the United States to enter into bilateral data-sharing agreements with qualifying countries under which the United States agrees to lift its bar on disclosure to law enforcement in a qualifying country if that country similarly agrees to lift any bar it has on disclosure to U.law enforcement. The CLOUD Act sets forth stringent requirements for such agreements in order to ensure privacy and data security. In particular, it provides that any requests by foreign law enforcement to U.providers under such an agreement cannot target or request information on U.persons.  Second, the CLOUD Act clarifies that a warrant served on a U.provider may reach data stored overseas provided the data is within the provider's possession, custody, or control. This will enable U.law enforcement investigating crimes to obtain information stored overseas without having to resort to cumbersome diplomatic channels.  Third, the CLOUD Act gives email and cloud computing providers the ability to challenge a warrant issued for data stored overseas if complying with the warrant would cause the provider to violate the laws of a foreign country. The court hearing such a challenge determines whether, in the interests of international comity, the warrant should be modified or quashed.  Finally, the CLOUD Act authorizes providers to disclose to a foreign government the fact that the provider has received a warrant for information stored in that country, provided the foreign government has entered into a bilateral data-sharing agreement, as previously described. This will enable the foreign government to assess compliance with the terms of the agreement and intervene diplomatically if it believes the request is inappropriate.  The CLOUD Act has broad support in both the tech community and among law enforcement. It bridges the divide that sometimes we see between these two groups.  The bill is an outgrowth of my International Communications Privacy Act, or ICPA, coupled with the United States-United Kingdom bilateral agreement framework that many of my colleagues are familiar with. Indeed, the United States-United Kingdom bilateral agreement framework outlined in the CLOUD Act is intended as a model for future agreements between the United States and other countries that are committed to privacy, human rights, and international law enforcement cooperation.  Expeditiously implementing similar agreements with the European Union and other allies is critical to protecting consumers around the world and facilitating legitimate law enforcement investigations.  I am pleased to be introducing this very important landmark legislation with my friends from Delaware, South Carolina, and Rhode Island, and intend to push hard to see it enacted in the very near future.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-05-pt1-PgS595-7.txt,1351,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017--Continued,2018.0,5.0,February

490,topic-id,967,"Mr.President, I rise today to denounce--this is a strong word but an appropriate word--the Republican effort to undermine America's faith in important institutions--all to protect Donald Trump from the Russia investigation.  This effort is self-evident to any neutral observer watching ``Fox and Friends,'' reading the ``Drudge Report,'' or following the President on Twitter, and it has profound consequences for our country.  Defending our critical institutions, such as the FBI and an independent Department of Justice, should not be a partisan issue, and those who care about these institutions have to speak up. This, of course, includes Members of  Many congressional Republicans, however, appear determined to transform legitimate congressional oversight into an arm of the President's defense. For example, the Teapot Dome hearings uncovered government corruption for personal gain. The Kefauver committee uncovered organized crime and corruption nationwide. The Watergate committee uncovered Nixon's conspiracy. The Church committee led to landmark reforms of the intelligence community, some of the very reforms that are currently being warped for Trump's benefit. These were bipartisan, fact-based, public inquiries into issues of national consequence.  The investigation into Russia's acknowledged interference in our election should be no different. Unfortunately, many of the Republicans in Congress investigating the Trump-Russia matter appear more concerned about protecting the President than getting at the truth. This is particularly so in the House of Representatives, where almost nothing happens on the Intelligence Committee without the assent of the White But it is also true in the Senate, where even the Judiciary Committee has been stymied in its efforts to get to the truth.  Certainly, it is not from a lack of trying. Democrats serving on relevant committees have demonstrated determination in fulfilling our constitutional oversight obligations, but this is nearly impossible without cooperation from the Republican majority. Without cooperation from Republicans, letters requesting information are not bipartisan, and interviews of key witnesses are delayed or are canceled, just to give two examples.  Conducting oversight behind closed doors and out of the public view lacks transparency, of course, and creates a situation ripe for exploitation. It allows Republicans to weaponize incomplete or inaccurate information for the President's benefit.  We have seen the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, use this tactic last week, in spite of concerns raised by the FBI and the Department of Congressman Nunes, determined to support the President's paranoid conclusion that the entire national security apparatus is out to get him, created a memo that misconstrued critical intelligence to engineer an outcome that pleased the White Armed with a misleading and inaccurate memo, Congressman Nunes and Republicans across the country, with the assistance of Russia bots on social media, launched a concerted attack on the FBI, the intelligence community, and the Justice Why? To prove a conspiracy against the President that does not exist.  Nunes and other Republicans knew the facts did not support their conspiracy theory, but the incitement continued anyway, even singling out for attack the President's own handpicked Director of the FBI after his agency opposed releasing the memo. By the time the committee released it and the public learned just how false and misleading it was, Congressman Nunes and his memo had already sowed the seeds of doubt about the FBI and its investigation.  The President rewarded Congressman Nunes yesterday by tweeting:       Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may      someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he      has exposed and what he has had to endure!  I think history will conclude otherwise.  Just as the President has praised the Nunes attacks on the FBI and the Justice Department, he has certainly been doing his part to undermine these institutions. He has done his part by demeaning and humiliating the very people he appointed to run these institutions. We can all recall the very personal attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Oval Office, demands for personal loyalty from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and assertions that the FBI was ``in tatters'' under the leadership of his handpicked Director, Christopher We can all appreciate the irony of Donald Trump's personal attacks against Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whom the President interviewed and seriously considered for a return to his old job as Director of the  The self-serving and personal attacks against people who refuse to do his bidding reflect the narcissism of a man who has little regard for his responsibilities as Sadly, for President Trump, it is all about him every time, all the time.  By attacking the Justice Department and the FBI, the President is attempting to discredit the Russia investigation and protect himself and his family. His words and actions are intended to undermine public confidence in the[[Page S643]]FBI and the Justice Department for his benefit in the here and now. He does not seem to care about the long-term consequences of eroding public confidence in two critical institutions charged with keeping us safe and protecting our rights.  Through all the obfuscation and negative personal attacks, a clear pattern has emerged. The President and his Republican allies will do whatever they can to discredit the Mueller Russia investigation without regard or respect for the collateral damage caused. Then they will turn to FOX News and other outlets to get their message or propaganda out to their base and dismiss the mainstream media as fake news. Sadly, for our country, it is a strategy that can win and that can work.  According to a new poll from Reuters, 73 percent of Republicans believe that the Justice Department and the FBI are trying to undermine the This state of affairs may serve the President's short-term interests, but it will have real and lasting negative consequences for our country in the years and decades to come.

Let me first thank the hard work of Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, fellow Ukraine Caucus chair and Representative Brendan Boyle, as well as Chairman Ed Royce and the Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their support.  As we know all too well, Russian aggression towards Ukraine is not a new threat. Russia's hostile behavior continues to threaten Ukraine's freedom and destabilize its critical infrastructure and institutions. Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, over 10,000 people have been killed and two million people have been uprooted, internally displaced.

As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, we remember victories such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. We can look back and celebrate these victories that brought us closer to the American principle of liberty and justice for all.  But the fight for equality, fairness, and justice continues. I am proud to stand with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus to call for true economic justice for the Black community. Still, today, Mr.Speaker, in 2018, Black people in America have to earn a high school education, a high school diploma, and complete some time in college to catch up to the wage of White high school dropouts.  The Black-White wage gap is larger today than it was in 1979. This tragic truth does not affect Black men and women the same. Since the year 2000, young Black women have been hit the hardest. However, the racial wealth gap is even greater. The average wealth for White families is seven times higher than the average wealth for Black families.  Mr.Speaker, with facts like this, no wonder many find it difficult to stand and applaud President Trump's belief that there is a trend of lower Black unemployment rates. Lower unemployment rates does not address this imbalance of wealth and opportunity, and backward policies do not deserve our cheers.

210,topic-id,393,"Mr.Speaker, let me use the example of mass incarceration.  In my State and in this budget in Congress, we are constantly cutting programs for education. In America, if you do not educate a child, their choices are very limited. Statistics have shown that the lower the education, the higher the rate of incarceration.  I will share with the gentleman that if we truly want to reduce the cost of mass incarceration, if we truly want a workforce that is trained and available to address economic opportunities and invest in technology, and ensure that we are paying taxes and growing our tax base, it will be more efficient to invest in education.  But, instead, we systematically, with budgets and cutting funds, empower the prison system, while at the same time create a disadvantage for people who then become what we so often hear: a burden to society, social welfare, and all these other things.  When you create the opportunity to provide leadership to say, ``We, in America, understand an educated American is an economic advantage,'' and we have systematically ignored that--we sit here as if every child in America is getting equal education--it is not a reality.

508,topic-id,1435,"Madam President, on another matter, last Friday, Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, received approval to release a classified memo that purports to show that a FISA application to conduct surveillance of a Trump campaign aide was politically motivated. Over the weekend, the President, speaking in the third person, told us this memo ``totally vindicates `Trump' '' in the Russia investigation. Following a pattern that has become all too familiar, the President also viciously attacked the FBI in a series of tweets, something we have never seen by any President, either Republican or Democratic--certainly not in my memory.  There are more than a few problems with this, the most disturbing of which go well beyond this highly flawed and misleading memo. In case anyone believes this memo represents a serious attempt to address serious problems within the FBI or within our FISA surveillance authorities, I want to raise a few points they might consider because if they think it actually addresses serious problems, they either haven't read it or they don't understand the serious problems.  For years, I have been leading calls in the Senate to protect our civil liberties and reform our surveillance authorities under I am appreciative of the number of Republicans and Democrats who have joined me in that cause. This memo, however, has absolutely nothing to do with improving Nor does this partisan memo have anything to do with serious oversight of FISA authorities more broadly.  Instead, whether intentional or not, this memo represents a direct attack on rank-and-file professionals in both our law enforcement and our national security agencies. The memo deliberately distorts a multilayered process that is required to obtain and renew a judicial warrant for a suspected foreign agent. This meticulous process to obtain or renew a judicial warrant is conducted by career, nonpartisan professionals. In this case, the process led to a warrant, approved by a Federal judge and was renewed three times, for Trump campaign adviser Carter  Carter Page is an individual who bragged about his ties to He even claimed at one point publicly to be an adviser to the He was also targeted for recruitment by known Russian spies beginning in 2013. Both of these facts are conveniently left out of the Nunes memo.  But the Nunes memo was not about capturing relevant facts or conducting actual oversight. If it were, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman would have read the underlying intelligence that purported to form the basis of the memo. He did not. If it were about actual oversight, he would have granted the FBI Director's request to brief his Committee prior to releasing the memo. He did not. If it were about transparency, he would have allowed the Democratic response memo to be released at the same time. He did not.  Instead, his Committee voted along party lines last week to block the Democratic response. We will learn later this evening if they are going to change course and allow its release.  I have been here since the beginning of both the House and the Senate Intelligence I have never seen anything as partisan as this.  Proponents of this memo claim it proves that the FISA warrant of Carter Page was politically motivated. They claim that the so-called Steele dossier was the reason why a FISA warrant was granted and that the dossier could not be relied on because it was indirectly funded by Democratic interests. What it ignores is that this document was only one part of the lengthy FISA application establishing probable cause. The judge had to look at all of it.  Never mind that the judge was explicitly informed of the likelihood of a political motivation behind the dossier. The Republican memo conveniently leaves that out. By leaving it out, it undermines its central claim that the FBI hid the ball on the dossier's political origins. And never mind that the dossier was originally funded by a conservative newspaper, or that its author had previously been assessed by the FBI to be a reliable source.  One can disregard all of those facts and still see the memo for what it is: a complete and utter dud. The memo itself just disproves its own premise. Because of its reference to the controversial Steele dossier, President Trump and his allies paint this FISA application as the Russia investigation's original sin. They ignore the fact that the memo also reveals that an entirely separate source unrelated to the Steele dossier provided information to the FBI that triggered the opening of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Oddly enough, that is something we did not see in President Trump's tweets over the weekend.  What we knew about the memo leads to one and only one conclusion: The FBI did its job. Rank-and-file professionals within the FBI and DOJ acted appropriately when obtaining a FISA warrant of Carter Frankly, the President's attacks on these career professionals for obtaining the FISA warrant are entirely without merit.  I have been here with Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents, eight Presidents in all, and I have never seen anybody make such unwarranted attacks on career professionals. These professionals, I suppose, if we really look, are Republicans, Democrats, and some are apolitical. All of them are professional. What the Republican memo from the House reveals is nothing about abuses in the FISA process, but it does reveal a lot about both the President and the House Republicans who released it. It represents yet another desperate, hyperpartisan attempt to smear key Justice Department officials and undermine the Russia investigation.  Again, in my 40-some-odd years in the Senate, I have never seen this under either Republican or Democratic leadership or either a Republican or Democratic  Let's remember what is at stake. This is not about a Republican memo, which is nothing more than a sloppy, bad-faith attempt to distract from the special counsel's Russia investigation, nor is it about the Steele dossier. That represents an almost irrelevant side story. The only thing that matters here is that a foreign adversary attacked our democracy in 2016, suffered no consequences, and is poised to do it again. The President is not willing to address this threat. He is not even willing to implement sanctions on Russia that were overwhelmingly approved by the vast majority of both Republicans and Democrats in the The only thing this President has done in response to this threat is disparage the very people who defend our country from such foreign attacks--our dedicated law enforcement and intelligence professionals. I am afraid that for the President, it is Trump first and America second.  The fact is, we are under constant attacks on our political system by Which countries did the President single out in the State of the Union Address as countries that pose grave threats to the United States? Venezuela and It is the second largest nuclear power in the world that is a threat, a power that has shown, by anybody's analysis or efforts--many of them successful--to undermine the electoral system not only of our country but of others.  It is more important than ever that the Special Counsel be able to complete his investigation without interference from either the President or any misguided allies in We need to know first how Russia interfered in our election, and whether anyone in the President's circle aided that effort or tried to cover it up.

500,topic-id,816,"Mr.President, I would like to honor the memory of a dear mentor and friend, Elder Von Keetch, who passed away suddenly on January 26 at the age of 57.  Elder Keetch was a brilliant attorney who used his gifts in the service of  As chief outside counsel and public affairs director to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Elder Keetch had the immense responsibility of representing his faith in the public square.  As an ardent supporter of religious freedom, he also had the privilege of defending others' ability to worship according to the dictates of their conscience.  ``Religious liberty is a God-given right,'' Elder Keetch said. ``It is essential to all men and women exercising their agency and learning to choose between right and wrong.''  Elder Keetch had deep respect for our constitutional rights because of his profession, but as a man of faith, he knew that conversions of the heart occur through personal encounters.  Mindful of this truth, Elder Keetch strove to imitate Jesus Christ in all aspects of his life. He encouraged his fellow Christians to do the same, even during contentious public debates.  ``Ask yourself how you can best teach and defend the doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ while also showing love, kindness, and understanding,'' he wrote.  Elder Keetch was born in Provo and lived for much of his life in  He earned his bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University and his law degree from BYU's law school.  During this period, he clerked at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Antonin Scalia, where he worked on pivotal religious liberty cases such as Employment Division v. Speech, 1990.  As he came up through the ranks, Elder Keetch caught the attention of prominent legal minds, including my father, Rex Lee, who mentored him during law school.  Years later, Elder Keetch would return the favor by mentoring another young BYU law student--me.  I still remember the enthusiasm that Elder Keetch brought to his class on the First He wanted to impress upon his students the importance of these old court decisions to our lives.  At least in my case--and I am sure in countless others--he succeeded.  After Elder Keetch graduated from law school, he could have worked at his choice of law firms in Washington, DC, or New Instead, after prayerful consideration, he returned to Utah to work at Kirton McConkie, a law firm that works closely with the LDS  Soon, Elder Keetch was an advocate in some of the highest profile public debates of our time, defending religious liberty against coercion and the institution of marriage against attempts to redefine it.  At the same time, Elder Keetch was called to positions of leadership within the LDS He was sustained as a General Authority Seventy of the Church on April 4, 2015.  So tireless was Elder Keetch that, when he was called to a full-time position in the LDS Church, two attorneys were assigned to take over his work.  In spite of these important and time-consuming responsibilities, Elder Keetch made family his first priority.  Elder Keetch is survived by six children and his wife, Bernice, who has been his steady companion and sweetheart since she invited him to a dance in high school. His family surrounded him with love as he battled cancer, the illness that eventually took him away from us.  It is hard to grapple with the unexpected death of a mentor, father, husband, and leader like Elder Von Keetch, but we should take heart from words that Elder Keetch himself spoke before a General Conference audience in 2015.  He said that trials were to be expected if we want to follow the One who suffered for us on  We represent the love and faith of Christ, Elder Keetch taught, ``in situations where we don't fully understand the reason for God's command.''  I don't know why my dear friend and mentor was called home so soon, but I can take inspiration from his spectacular life.  I still recall a phone conversation with Elder Keetch many years ago, when I was finishing a clerkship with then-Judge Samuel  Elder Keetch was by then a prominent attorney. By contrast, I was a kid fresh out of school looking for life advice.  Still, he took my call, listened with great care and attention, and gave wise counsel that served me well down the line. Undoubtedly, Elder Keetch's time could have been spent better elsewhere, yet he chose to spend it on me.  That is what I will remember about Elder He brought the same enthusiasm to pivotal court cases and seemingly unimportant phone conversations.

Under the new process, employees who file a complaint would have the choice to enter into mediation instead of being required to do so, as is currently the case. Employees should not be forced into mandatory mediation, especially with an employer against whom they have raised allegations of sexual harassment or other types of discrimination. This bill also eliminates the thirty-day ``cooling off'' period currently mandated by the  Filing a workplace complaint can be harrowing for employees, and having no choice but to face the employer or colleague against whom they have filed the complaint may deter employees from going through with it. That is why the protections in this bill from retaliation by the employing office for requesting remote work or paid leave by an employee who has a filed a complaint are so important.  Unpaid interns, fellows, and detailees in Congressional offices should not be more vulnerable to workplace harassment and discrimination than their congressional staff colleagues. This bill would extend coverage of the rights and protections established under the CAA to these groups.  The bill also requires that a climate survey be conducted of all offices covered by the CAA, each Congress, regarding the workplace environment, including sexual harassment. Collecting information, anonymously, from staff will help us determine whether the reforms we hope in this bill are serving their purpose or if modifications are needed.  H.4924 is the culmination of bipartisan work on the part of House Administration Committee Chairman Harper and Ranking Member Brady, and my fellow members on the Committee, as well as the leadership of my colleague Jackie Speier, who has championed the issue of fighting sexual harassment on the I want to thank them all for working collaboratively on this legislation.

The Stop Taxpayers Obligations to Perpetrators of Sexual Harassment Act will require Members of Congress to pay back any taxpayer money used to settle sexual harassment cases. Victims will be compensated, but taxpayers won't be footing the bill.  This bill promotes and supports due process. It sends a message that there isn't a set fund out there paid for by the taxpayer ready for someone to access, but it also doesn't encourage a Member who feels that they have done nothing wrong to settle so an issue can just go away.

249,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and in support of the underlying bills: H.772, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2017; H.1153, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017; and my bill, H.4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018.  Both H.1153 and H.4771 have received strong bipartisan support in the Financial Services Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support this rule.  The goal of H.4771 is one that I have been pushing for the past few years to help our small banks thrive and serve their communities. Since that is a shared goal on both sides of the aisle, I am grateful that Mr.Gottheimer and Mr.Meeks joined me in cosponsoring this bill.  The Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018 is a very simple bill that helps small banks and savings and loan companies get the access to capital they need to serve the financial needs of small businesses and individuals in their communities.  This bill would simply raise the consolidated asset threshold under the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion in assets.  Raising the asset threshold means that hundreds of additional small banks and thrift holding companies around the country will qualify for coverage under the policy statement and, therefore, be exempt from certain regulatory and capital guidelines.  These exemptions make it easier for these small holding companies to raise capital and issue debt. Many holding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges with regard to capital formation, which is particularly of concern for small institutions that are struggling to meet higher capital level demands by regulators.  The Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement was first issued in 1980 and provides exemptions from certain capital guidelines for small bank institutions. These capital standards were originally established for larger institutions and disproportionately harm small bank holding companies.  The policy statement also makes it easier to form new banks and thrift holding companies and to make the acquisitions by issuing debt at the holding company level.  These are all important tools in ensuring that our smallest institutions can continue to lend to consumers and small businesses in their communities and survive in an environment that continuously challenges our community banks.  The policy statement also contains several safeguards designed to ensure that small bank holding companies that operate with higher levels of debt permitted by the policy statement do not present an undue risk to the safety and the soundness of these subsidiary banks.  Mr.Speaker, this is a simple bill to help our small banks stay strong and continue to support their communities. The last time the threshold was raised in 2014, the effort received widespread bipartisan support.  H.4771 also received strong bipartisan support in the Financial Services Committee during the most recent markup.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to give equal support to this rule.

Since President Trump's draconian FY 2018 budget was released last year, Democrats have warned Republicans that a bipartisan budget agreement was needed to adequately invest in American families and communities. Without a budget agreement, programs as diverse as Head Start, job training, and terrorism prevention grants are in danger of inadequate funding, at best.

87,topic-id,2179,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss something extremely important to each one of us in this wonderful body, which is called civility and trust. I rise to discuss them because they have been lost in I look around and we are all friends, and for some reason we lost trust in each other. We don't seem to spend enough time with each other.  I can remember Senator Robert Byrd, who was the longest serving Senator in the history of the U.Senate, and he always told me what a place this was. He said that the Senate is something special. He even wrote a book about it, about how the Senate was to operate, what the Founding Fathers' intent was for the bipartisan, bicameral body that George Washington explained so eloquently, and what our role was as the most deliberative body in the world. The whole world depends on us kind of cooling things off and making things work. But as we have seen, it hasn't done what it is supposed to do, and it is not to blame one person or the other or one party or the other. I guess we can all say that it is all of our fault for letting it denigrate to this point.  Several years ago, I took a personal pledge. I just knew something was wrong. When I first got here, I looked around and I saw that we were all expected to make phone calls raising money every day to our respective parties, and that money would be used for a couple of purposes. The purpose was basically to set an agenda or explain your priorities and your policies, but a lot of that money was directed toward defeating colleagues on the other side. So being in the Democratic caucus, the Democratic money was supposed to be raised and, if any one of my friends on the Republican side was up in this cycle, that money was supposed to be used against them. I thought that was wrong, and I know a lot of my Republican friends feel the same way--that they are supposed to be making phone calls to raise money to be used against me and everybody else who is up in this cycle. I am sure they feel the same as I do.  I have often said that I come to work in a hostile work environment, and I try to explain that in terms of how we in West Virginia would look upon this. If you go to work every day in my State of West Virginia and your colleague or some person with whom you are working is trying to undermine and undercut you to get you fired, and every day you go to work they are nice to your face but behind the scenes they are doing all they can to denigrate your work or to make your supervisors believe that you are not doing your job, back home in West Virginia, sooner or later, they are going to want a little talk. Can we talk in the parking lot? Can we have this disagreement worked out? That is just the way it would be settled, and, maybe, that is the way it should be settled here too. I don't know. I don't think so.  I have met too many wonderful people with whom I have been serving for the last 7 years who are bright, extremely capable, intelligent, and with a wealth of experience, and I would put them up against any people whom I have met anywhere in any occupation in the country. But for some reason, we are all blocked from doing the right thing or what we know is right--sitting down and not accusing each other, not working and conspiring against each other, and not getting basically to the point that it is so visceral. Perhaps, someone might be talking with me one day, but, then, that weekend they might be in my State campaigning against me. Then, we come back on Monday or Tuesday, and we are supposed to sit down and work through our problems and differences for the betterment of our country. I just think human nature doesn't let that happen, and it will not produce good results.  I have always looked forward to working with everybody. I am probably one of the most centrist, as far as being on more pieces of legislation in a bipartisan way. I have never looked at a Republican or a Democratic problem. I just looked at a problem that we had,[[Page S625]]and I always said this: The best form of government--the best policies and the best form of politics, if you want to play hardcore politics--is good government. Everyone can take credit for doing something good, and I will assure you, if we do something wrong and we don't fix things, we all get blamed. We all get blamed. So nobody looks good when we sit and don't work on our differences, and we all get credit when we try to work together.  We are facing a lot of challenges right now. We do things that basically shun the other side because we don't want to share the glory with someone else if we think there is some good in the piece of legislation. Every piece of legislation we have voted for or against has good in it. Every piece of legislation has something good and worthwhile in it. What happens is that there are ways we can make something better, and that is where our differences are. If you can make something better, then, I need to sit down and work with you because I don't have all the answers, but we both have a desire to make the best piece of policy that we can in legislation. So we should be working together. I should be open to saying: OK, that makes sense to me; let's see if we can amend this and fix it. But it seems that we get set in our ways.  The place that Robert Byrd talked about many years ago was a place where people stayed and spent more time in They didn't come in on Monday night and leave on Thursday afternoon. They stayed and worked. On the weekends, they would even get together and have dinners together. Families would do things together during the days and the weekends, and they became friends. It is hard to say no to your friend. It is hard. All of us have been in situations that were very hurtful, when there was a friend with whom you disagreed. So you tried to find the most delicate way to see if there was a pathway forward without losing that friendship. It meant that much to us. That is what it should be here, too. But when you don't have that relationship--as a former Governor, I have my dear friend from South Dakota, and we are going to look for a way to stay together and be friends. We are not going to look for a way to disagree and diverge from that friendship that we built.  We built that over our terms working together as I have always said that Governors are the most bipartisan people I have ever met.  In our NGA--National Governors Association--when you had an education problem, when you had a Medicaid problem, when you had an infrastructure problem, when you had a veterans problem, if you looked around and you saw someone in one State who had found a pathway forward to fix that, you never hesitated to call them and say: Hey, Mike, what did you think about it? He would say: Well, I tried this, Why don't you try it? I will send someone or you send someone out, and we will work together.  That is what I was used to doing as far as getting things done, and that is what I want to do here again. I think the place is right for it. The American people want it solved and want the States we represent to have a bipartisan pathway forward and to work together. I know the people of West Virginia want to see us get things accomplished.  I have a wonderful little State that has given their all. I often tell people in West Virginia--I tell the children: When someone asks you where you are from, I want you to puff up your chest. I want you to say: Oh, I come from a beautiful State, one of the most patriotic States in the  We have answered the call to duty more than most any We have more veterans per capita than most any We have fought more wars, shed more blood, lost more lives for the cause of freedom than any We have done the heavy lifting. We have mined the coal that made the steel that built the guns and ships that defend our country every day.  The Good Lord has been so kind to us and blessed us with one of the greatest venues that you will ever see in the mountains of West My little State is called West Virginia, and we hope you will come and visit, and maybe you will even stay.  It is really who we are. And we all have that same pride; each one of us does. Whether it be Indiana, South Dakota, wherever it may be, we have a pride in our States, the people in our States, and they deserve better than what we are giving them right now.  I don't see anybody in public service, who is willing to put their name on the ballot, as my enemy. If you are willing to serve, then I am your comrade. I am going to work with you. If you are willing to take the heat that comes with these jobs, then let's make sure we get the results that the jobs should produce. These jobs should produce results so that the whole world can have a hope that America is the right place. They are the people who can solve the problems that we all have, and they still can lift us up and be the hope of the world.  With that, I am pledging to the people of West Virginia and to the American people that I will not campaign against a sitting colleague, that I will not directly fundraise against them, that I will not distribute any direct mail against them. I will not appear or endorse any advertisements directed at them. I will not use or endorse social media campaigns that attack them.  Washington will be dysfunctional until we all draw the line of truce and say that we are here for the same reason. We take the same oath. We swear on the Bible to the same Constitution--that we will uphold it. That is what we are here to do.  Since that civility has broken down because the system has changed and we are not here and we don't know each other's families, spouses, children, we better control ourselves, hopefully through the rules we can change and the ethics laws we should live by, to treat each other in the manner that we would want to be treated.  With that, I am going to sign this pledge, and I would hope that all of my colleagues would consider signing the pledge the same way. We are the only ones who can change it. The power has changed. The pressure that comes within has changed. The way this place works has changed. The only way we can change it is to say we are not going to participate in denigrating each other and attacking each other anymore.  With that, I am going to sign the pledge. It says here:       Pledge to Return to Era of Bipartisan Cooperation and            In order to restore civility to the United Senates Senate      and our political discourse, we must pledge to return to an      era of bipartisan cooperation and agreement.       I, Joe Manchin, pledge to the people of West Virginia and      to the American people that I will not campaign against a      sitting colleague, not directly fundraise against them, not      distribute direct mail against them, not appear or endorse      advertisements directed at them, and not use or endorse      social media campaigns that attack them.  I would hope that each one of you would consider this. I think we have to take this into our own hands right now and make sure that we look at each other, that we look at each other with sincerity. You are my friend. We might disagree, but we can work through this, Mr.We can definitely work through this and remember what our purpose is for being here. The people want us to succeed.

481,topic-id,1043,"Mr.President, I wish to thank Senator Cantwell for organizing the opportunity this afternoon to speak about this egregious decision that was made by the Trump administration that will allow for drilling for[[Page S637]]oil off of the beaches of the United States of It is an absolute disgrace that this administration is doing something like this. What we have on our hands is a President who has a hard time listening to his own message.  Last week, he was bragging about how much new oil we are discovering in He is so proud of this. In fact, we export a million and a half barrels of oil a day. Listen to that again: We export a million and a half barrels of oil a day. Where do we send this oil? We send it to We send it to other countries.  Is the President happy with that? No, he says we need more oil; we need to drill off of our beaches--notwithstanding what that will do to our tourism industry, to our fishing industry, or to any industry that does business along the coastlines of our country. Ultimately, what would be the purpose to which this oil would be put? Export the oil.  So how does that formula really work? The oil companies come to the beaches of Massachusetts or any other They set up rigs and start to drill for oil. They find the oil. Then, they sell that oil somewhere else around the world. Meanwhile, people who live off of those beaches in Massachusetts or any other State run all the risk if there is an accident, as there was in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 in the BP oilspill.  So the risks are run by the States that don't want the drilling, and the benefits all run to the oil companies that get to sell this oil around the world. It makes perfect sense because ``GOP'' really stands for ``gas and oil party.'' That is what they have turned themselves into. It is whatever Big Oil wants, even if State after State after State says it does not want this to happen.  Every single State, from Maine down to Florida, was going to be giving permission to the oil companies to commence drilling, but the Governor of Florida--a Republican Governor--protested. He said he didn't want there to be drilling off the coast of Florida, after Florida had already been included in the plan.  So what happens? All of a sudden, the Trump administration decides that they are going to have a gator giveaway. All of a sudden, Florida gets to be exempt. Why would Florida be exempt? Maybe because it has a Republican Maybe because that Republican Governor is thinking about running for the U.So maybe, just maybe, this Governor, who once supported drilling off of the coast of Florida, all of a sudden says: The people don't want it. They don't want the beaches of Florida to be endangered.  So what happens? Governor Scott from Florida all of a sudden starts shedding crocodile tears about how much he cares about the beaches, even though he had always been supportive of offshore drilling. That leads to the gator giveaway where, all of a sudden, Florida is not in.  I don't think it is incidental that Mar-a-Lago is actually in Florida, as well, and maybe Donald Trump hadn't been fully consulted by Secretary Zinke and the Department of the Interior on this inclusion of But before you knew it, all of a sudden, Florida was no longer on the map, but every other State that doesn't have a Republican Governor running for the Senate, that doesn't have a President of the United States with a summer resort, a winter resort, a spring and summer resort--Mar-a-Lago--is stuck with this decision.  The problem with what they did is this: It is obviously arbitrary and capricious. It is obviously a violation of the Administrative Procedures It is obviously something that will never stand up in court--that after a decision is made to include every State, all of a sudden Florida comes up. It will never hold up. That will be the basis of the case made by the attorneys general and all of the business and environmental interests that will be suing on this issue.  So what part of this really works? It is oil that will be drilled for at the risk of despoiling the beaches and the fishing industry--the tens of billions of dollars in the fishing and tourism industry--with the benefits running to one single industry.  The American Petroleum Institute is trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, they are saying: We are at the boom time of all times in oil drilling in the United We are energy independent. This is the boom time.  Donald Trump is sounding the same exact way, boasting across the country about his energy policies, his fossil-fuel-first policies. He keeps saying that he has ended the war on energy. It is not true because just last week he imposed a 30-percent tariff on importation of solar panels. So he is talking about no war on his favorite energy technology. But if he doesn't like them, they get a 30-percent increase in tariffs on the very technologies that, in polling, 80 percent of all Americans want to see increased inside of our country.  We are going to be fighting this every single step of the way. It is immoral, it is unnecessary, and it violates the goals that individual States have in order to advance their own economies. I, personally, am going to exhaust all available legislative tools to fight this attempt by President Trump to allow drilling off of the coast of Massachusetts, the east coast, and nearly every other single mile of coastline in the United States, with the exception of  That includes using the Congressional Review Act, which allows for agency action to be undone by a simple majority in both I plan to pursue such a Congressional Review Act resolution if the Trump administration moves forward with this reckless plan.

478,topic-id,1234,"Mr.President, first of all, let me congratulate my colleague from Florida on the most recent historic launch. There is no one who has been a greater advocate for America's space program than Senator I appreciate his leadership as well on this issue, which goes all the way from Florida, across the entire Atlantic and, of course, the Pacific as well.  I rise in strong opposition to the Trump administration's offshore drilling plan. I am here to speak on behalf of New Jersey's shore businesses--the restaurants, the bait-and-tackle shops, and the bed-and-breakfasts that depend on clean beaches to succeed. Their businesses are the lifeblood of the Jersey Their voices deserve to be heard. Their livelihoods are on the line. Yet this administration remains solely focused on what is good for Big Oil's bottom line, never mind the consequences for our economy, the health of the planet, or our vibrant coastal communities.  The Interior Department's offshore drilling plan reads like a wish list for oil industry executives. Clearly, the Trump administration didn't consult my constituents when drafting this plan. By the way, we had already gone through a 5-year plan, so there were supposed to be 5 years before we revisited this, and now we are back at it again. They didn't consult the shop owners in Asbury Park or the fishermen in Belford or the innkeepers in Cape May, because if they had, they would have learned that our shoreline is an economic powerhouse for our  Each year, New Jersey's tourism industry generates $44 billion in economic activity, directly and indirectly supporting nearly 10 percent of the State's workforce. Likewise, our seafood industry supports over 31,000 jobs, and we are home to one of America's largest saltwater recreational fisheries, supporting over 16,000 jobs. Together, the homes and businesses along the Jersey Shore encompass almost $800 billion in property values.  All of this adds up to a simple reality: Clean coasts are vital to the economic security of millions of New The same holds true for towns up and down the Atlantic shoreline. Yet the Trump administration plans to ignore the concern of the communities that have the most to lose. They ignore the more than 120 municipalities, the 1,200 elected officials, the 41,000 businesses, and the 500,000 fishing families from up and down the east[[Page S635]]coast who voiced their opposition the last time oil and gas drilling was being considered. They ignore concerns from the Pentagon and NASA about disruptions to their operations from drilling in the They ignore the opposition of my west coast colleagues to drilling in the They ignore the Department of the Interior's own finding that the Arctic drilling comes with a 75-percent chance of an oilspill in a treacherous and challenging environment. Simply put, the Trump drilling plan ignores everyone except Big  What is happening here is a dream scenario for the oil industry, but it is a nightmare for our shore communities. It is a gift to corporate polluters at the expense of our coastal economies.  By the way, I love these commercials that I see that talk about American energy independence. As you have heard my colleague Senator Wyden say before, we are now an exporter of oil. Well, how is it that you are exporting oil? You are drilling it here in the continental waters of the United States, but you are exporting it abroad for others to use. It seems to me that if you are drilling on Federal lands and waters, you should keep it here for domestic energy consumption to keep the price down and to keep energy security. That is real energy security, not having Big Oil drill here and then export it all over the world so that they can make a profit. I don't know how that makes us more energy secure here at home.  Make no mistake--this administration's massive expansion of offshore drilling is just the beginning. They are also working to dismantle minimal safety standards for offshore drilling. That is right. The Trump administration not only wants more offshore drilling, it also wants to permit more dangerous offshore drilling.  The Interior Department reportedly seeks to weaken the well control rule--the critical safety standards put in place after the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, which taught us something: If you drill, you will spill. If you drill, you will spill. At some point, that will happen. During Superstorm Sandy, which took place along the east coast of the Atlantic, imagine if we had oil rigs off the shore of New We would have had spills. We would have had spills. So instead of saving lives and saving our environment and the economic consequences that flow from that, the Trump administration's actions aim to save the industry $90 million.  During his Senate confirmation, Secretary Zinke promised to ``work with rather than against local communities in the states.'' Well, it sure feels as though he is working against New The Secretary has shown no concern for the Jersey Shore communities that would be devastated by an oilspill--the shuttered businesses, the destroyed industries, the massive job losses, and the birthright of every New Jerseyan to go to the Jersey Shore and enjoy its pristine beaches. That is why it is all the more baffling that Secretary Zinke recently said that after hearing from concerned Florida businesses and public officials, he would consider exempting the State from the disastrous Trump drilling plan. When asked about the decision, the Secretary said that ``local voices count.''  Well, I am happy if that is what is going to happen for Florida, but guess what--if it is good enough for Mar-a-Lago, it certainly should be good enough for the Jersey That is why every Member of the New Jersey congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats alike, recently joined me on a letter inviting Secretary Zinke to visit the Jersey We would be happy to have him meet with community leaders, business owners, and families who depend on clean coasts. If he wants to focus on the economics of oil drilling, I suggest he start with the thousands of people who would be out of a job if oil starts washing up on our beaches.  The Secretary needs to hear from constituents of mine like Charles from Tom's River, who recently wrote to say:       We already have some shoreline concerns, thanks to Super      Storm We definitely don't need another threat to our      economy.  Jeanne from New Brunswick wrote:       Tourism is a major New Jersey business. Our beaches are      pristine and must be protected.  He needs to hear from any of the thousands of New Jerseyans who have signed my COAST Anti-Drilling Act citizen petition to permanently ban drilling in the whole Atlantic  The Jersey Shore is a national treasure, home to generations of family vacations, successful small businesses, and vibrant coastal communities that are visited by people from across the Atlantic coast, Canadians who come down and spend their money at our shore, and so many others. That may not mean anything to ExxonMobil or It may not mean anything to President Trump or Secretary But it means something to me. That is why we are here today to give voice to New Jerseyans who have gone unheard. We will not stand silent while this administration tries to auction the Jersey Shore off to the highest bidder--not without a fight.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson).

480,topic-id,945,"Mr.President, I appreciate that Senator Cantwell organized this time for a group of us to come to the floor to speak about this disastrous, insane plan to drill throughout 90 percent of our coastal shelf. This, the Interior Secretary tells us, is part of President Trump's directive to rebuild the offshore oil and gas program, but he also conveyed it was the President's directive to ``take into consideration the local and State voices.''  Well, certainly the draft plan--if you can call it a draft--didn't take into account local or State voices. Had the Interior Secretary bothered to actually consult, this is what he would have heard from people in Our Governor, Kate Brown, denounced the plan, saying: ``In what universe would this be okay?''  Noah Oppenheim, the executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, stated:       The Trump administration wants to put fish and fisheries at      significant risk while lining the pockets of their oil      industry co-conspirators. Meanwhile, more frequent oil spills      and more intense ocean acidification and ocean warming are      guaranteed to ensue.  Charlie Plybon, the Oregon policy manager at Surfrider Foundation, an organization made up of everyday people passionate about protecting our oceans and our beaches, shared this opinion:       We are united in an understanding of the threats which      offshore oil drilling poses to our coastal economy, jobs and      culture we have today. We will not gamble our ocean resources      with dangerous oil exploration and polluting drilling      activities that put our future and that of generations to      come at risk.  Charlie went on to convey the enormous disparity between the economy that is driven by fishing and ocean recreation and by tourism as compared to the economy driven by oil drilling and how the former completely outweighs the latter.  The Association of Northwest Steelheaders is one of the oldest and most cherished conservation and sport fishing advocacy organizations in the Pacific Their statement is the following:       This proposal stands to go against everything we believe      in. Drilling for oil and gas off the coast of Oregon      compromises our fisheries, our coastal economies, and our      values.  These folks know what they are talking about.  The Tribes weighed in through the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Their resolution conveys opposition to ``any proposal to open Pacific offshore waters from California to and including Alaska to offshore drilling.''  Scott McMullen, the chairman of the Oregon Fishermen's Cable Committee--a group of troll fishermen who have been very involved in negotiations involving the fiber optic cable lines that are laid in the ocean--said:       The Oregon fishing industry has had a long history of good      stewardship of the fishing grounds which are open for      multiple uses. Oil platforms in our fishing grounds would      deny access to the resources that fishermen, fish processors      and thriving coastal communities depend on. To take away the      right to use our historical shared fishing grounds by      awarding drilling rights for this single industrial use would      be wrong.  Dale Beasley had this opinion:       As president of the Columbia River Crab Fisherman's      Association and Coalition of Coastal Fisheries, our position      on any fixed structures in the ocean and particularly oil      platforms is simple--NO NO AND NO again.       Our members rely 100% on clean sustainable marine waters      for 100% of our families income.  Terry Thompson, Lincoln County commissioner, stated:       The state of Oregon has been a leader in the nation in      terms of protecting our environment while responsibly      utilizing our natural resources.       We banned oil and gas development years ago because of the      potential risk to our ocean, which is one of the most      productive places in the world.       The President's proposal to allow oil and gas development      is an attempt to override the will of the people and shows a      complete disconnect between the Administration and the people      of the  I think these voices--the voices of the crabbing industry and the salmon industry, the fishing industry and the tourism industry--these voices of the coastal economy, reverberate in absolute parallel and passionate opposition to drilling off our coast for oil.  Before the drilling takes place, there are massive amounts of explosions that are conducted in order to create the maps of what is under the surface for potential drilling. That alone--just the preparation for drilling--is deeply disturbing, but imagine what an oilspill looks like.  This is a map of the Washington and Oregon coast, with the outline overlaid with the gulf oilspill. It covers a section that is the entire length of the State of Oregon and the State of Imagine those hundreds of miles of soiled beaches, the oil's impact on the ecosystem of the fisheries. There is no way this risk is justified for pumping a few more barrels of oil--which, I might point out, should be left in the ground anyway because burning oil that we are extracting from the ground is steadily raising the temperature of the planet and the temperature of our oceans, which absorb the vast majority of the heat from burning fossil fuels, and that is creating changes, from ocean acidification to the bleaching of the coral reefs, and all kinds of impacts on the surface of the continents.  So I say to the Interior Secretary, you have been given a mission by the President of the United States, which, as you have stated, is to take into consideration local and State voices, so simply hear those voices, and then take Oregon out of the equation, take Washington out of the equation, take California out of the equation, take every State that objects out of this equation, and, by the way, it would be wise to take the rest out as well.

339,topic-id,717,"Mr.Speaker, I think everyone can agree here that continuing resolutions--CRs--are bad policy.  For the folks in the gallery, it is simple.

They are whether you can figure out what is going on with your taxes, call the They are whether or not we actually function.  Yes, it is going to be our fifth Shame on all of us, and I do mean all of us.  However, the people on the other side of the aisle, they talk about all their legislative agenda they want put in the package and passed or they are going to vote against keeping the lights on. Think about that.  They say: If we don't get DACA, we are shutting the lights off. If we don't get this, we will shut the lights off.  That is what happened in the Senate the last shutdown.  They say: If we don't get full-year funding for the military, we are shutting the lights off. If we don't get DACA, we are shutting the lights off. If we don't get permanent funding for CHIP, we are shutting the lights off.  It didn't work out very well, did it?  Our fundamental responsibility is to keep the lights on. There is nothing in this bill that is objectionable. In fact, they have all passed. This bill supports full-year funding for the Department of Defense appropriations. This isn't the first time we passed the appropriations bill for the Department of We have passed it three times. And we sent it to the Senate to die a cruel and horrible death.  Why?

On the other side of the aisle, who will do anything to get their agenda,[[Page H826]]including putting our military at risk.

It provides a 2.4 percent increase to the men and women in the military who put their lives on the line for our Nation, well deserved, something we also voted for and supported.  The bill provides full extensions for popular health programs that, in fact, both sides of the aisle supported, a 2-year extension of community health centers.  In Michigan, federally qualified health centers serve nearly 650,000 individuals. There are 11 health centers located in my congressional district. They need the funding. That is why I support it. In all of your districts, you have community health centers.  But you will argue: Unless we get DACA, we won't fund the military; we won't fund the health centers. This bill also extends Medicare policies, providing options for people receiving home care. Again, it was a bipartisan vote, but now we don't want to support it.

482,topic-id,933,"Mr.President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the Trump administration's latest move to override the will of Washington State's citizens--our fishing families, our small business owners, our environmentalists, and our outdoor enthusiasts--by opening our coastal waters to harmful oil and gas drilling.  The continental waters on the west coast are one of our State's richest and most cherished national resources, sustaining communities along the Pacific Northwest for centuries and helping to define our regional culture for generations. It would be hard to overstate just how important Washington's coastal waters are to our local way of life.  Many of us count on our coasts for our food or work. Washington State coasts are home to numerous seafood- and tourism-dependent communities, and they support a $50 billion maritime economy and nearly 200,000 maritime-related jobs--not to mention countless families and travelers who are seeking outdoor recreation and flock to our shores throughout the year to experience the natural beauty and sport of our iconic shorelines.  To put it simply, Washingtonians don't take our healthy coasts for granted. We know that keeping our shores pristine isn't just about leisure and scenic views. Preserving our coastal waters is a critical factor in promoting a healthy regional ecosystem and an economy that support vital jobs and industries, fish and wildlife, and public health opportunities that many of us--our families, friends, and neighbors--rely on.  So I, too, was deeply disappointed but, ultimately, unsurprised when Interior Secretary Zinke announced the Department's plan to ignore the existing oil and gas leasing program that was just approved a few years ago and instead moved to draft and implement a new program that would allow offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all of our Nation's continental waters, including our coastal waters off of Washington  Despite decades of factfinding and public input that already established the need to protect ecologically sensitive areas like our coasts, it appears, once again, that President Trump and his Cabinet have decided to prioritize Big Oil and the relentless pursuit of profit over the interests of Washington State families and with virtually no regard to what their one-sided policy proposals may mean for our environment, for our public health, or for our economy.  To add insult to injury, I was even more appalled when it was reported just a few days later that Secretary Zinke was planning to remove Florida's waters from consideration after[[Page S638]]meeting with their Governor and hearing their concerns. I will leave it to others to wonder what exactly persuaded Secretary Zinke to remove Florida from that list, but I can't say I was stunned when that courtesy was not extended to Washington State, even after our Governor made the exact same request.  Later, while I was on my way back home from the other Washington and concerned about the potentially damaging impacts of Secretary Zinke's decision on our Washington State ecosystem, I decided to ask my followers on Twitter to join me in sending a message to the Interior Department and tweet photos of some of Washington State's many important and pristine coastal areas. I just have to say that the response was overwhelming.  Within hours, my timeline was filled with photos of beaches and coasts all along Washington State's shoreline, from Ruby Beach to Bellingham Bay to Olympic National Park to Orcas Island--photos of painted sunsets on the Puget Sound, the majestic calm of Cape Flattery, and of rainbows arching across the Bell Island shore, photos of children running across the beaches of Kalaloch, and photos of fishermen unloading their haul in Salmon I even received photos from other coastal areas in the Pacific They were all from residents who want their pristine shorelines preserved, and they were eager to raise their voices to safeguard our coasts.  I was inspired as I scrolled through this growing and beautiful collection of photos that illustrated the significance of our coasts, not just to our State's economy and environment but to our shared culture and identity. Our shores are where we fish, swim, exercise, and work, but also where our wildlife roams, our children play, and where we make lasting memories with our loved ones.  It is not too late for the Interior Department to reverse its misguided decision to expand offshore oil and gas drilling and instead focus on maintaining and strengthening existing regulations protecting this country's continental waters.  I really hope Secretary Zinke and officials at the Interior Department finally hear loud and clear what Washingtonians have been saying for decades--that the extreme environmental and ecological dangers posed by offshore oil and gas drilling are too great a risk for Washington State families. I hope they move quickly to reschedule the public meeting they were supposed to hold yesterday in Tacoma, so people from Washington can share their concerns with the Department directly.  I want to remind my colleagues and everyone in our country who cares about our environment that this fight is far from over. As we have learned over the last year, it is important that we continue to make our voices heard again and again to ensure that this administration backs down from this reckless proposal and puts the interest of Washington State families first.  As a voice for Washington State here in the Senate, I am going to continue fighting against the Trump administration's efforts to leverage our environment to boost Big Oil's bottom line, and I know I will never stop standing with our families, workers, and small businesses to protect our coasts today and for future generations.

489,topic-id,907,"Mr.President, I wish to commend my colleagues who are sounding the alarm about Russia's interference in U.elections and who have worked tirelessly for months on their respective committees to get the answers that Americans deserve and give the confidence Americans need to know that their government is committed to preventing such interference from ever happening again.  This work is incredibly important to people around the country and in my home State of I have heard from countless people who deeply love this country but fear for its institutions, and they are concerned about the integrity of elections.  Here are the facts. More than a year ago, U.intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the last Presidential election, calling Russia's meddling a ``significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort'' compared to previous attempts.  That is not my opinion. It is not a partisan statement. It is a fact. Even more troubling, they are already back at it. We know this because our President's own handpicked CIA Director said last week that, ``of course,'' Russia is trying to meddle in this year's midterm elections.  That is exactly why this Congress approved sanctions months ago in order to punish Russia and show them the steep price of doing this again. If there is one issue that we should all be able to agree on, it is that no one should get away with such a devious attack on our democracy. But, somehow, while the public is demanding action, the White House has gone silent, refusing to implement sanctions for reasons President Trump can't or will not explain.  This same President, who has no problems speaking or tweeting on any other topic under the sun, clams up when it comes to Russia or he tries to change the subject or he launches a political attack. This same President, who promised to put ``America first,'' has failed to live up to the most basic duty of defending our elections and enforcing congressional actions to punish Russian meddling.  The same President who promised law and order has been lashing out against a special counsel investigation, with a campaign to discredit our agencies of law and order by criticizing the men and women of our Nation's top law enforcement agencies, firing or threatening to fire those who stand up to him, and sowing doubt about the media that dares to report the facts.[[Page S642]]  Let's remember that the Putin regime that President Trump is so fond of is one that has invaded and annexed part of Ukraine and continues to incite war in Ukraine, is propping up the murderous Assad regime and is every bit as responsible for those heinous acts as Assad himself, and constantly tries to instigate conflict by threatening our troops around the world.  Perhaps the most disappointing piece of this is that President Trump is now not acting alone. He gets help from Members of Congress who join in partisan attacks on the FBI and Department of Just think about that. We have a President and Members of the Republican Party who are more interested in helping a foreign power get away with interfering in our elections than allowing an investigation to run its course.  It is simply stunning how far some of my Republican colleagues would go to undermine the special counsel and congressional investigations in order to score political points. This doesn't just put them at odds with the public in the short term. This has long-term consequences for the men and women who protect our country from harm. A few days ago, a former supervisory special agent with the FBI who served as a counterterrorism investigator and special assistant to the Bureau's Director explained why he was now resigning from the FBI in order to speak publicly.  He said his resignation was painful but ``the alternative of remaining quiet while the bureau is tarnished for political gain is impossible.'' He said he worries that the damage from attacks on the integrity of the FBI could last generations.  There are a number of things this Congress must commit to. First of all, we must ensure that Special Counsel Robert Mueller stays on the job and continues to follow the facts wherever they may lead, without threat or intimidation and with the resources he needs. We already know the President talked about firing Mr.Mueller last year. Well, the President should be on notice: Firing Mueller is not an option, and the same goes for trying to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod  I also want to be clear. Doling out a Presidential pardon to try to cover up any collusion or obstruction of justice is unacceptable and will be met with furious resistance across the country.  This is about our elections, our national security, and it is about our standing in the world. No one--no one--should stand in the way of a thorough investigation. In the coming days, weeks, and months, Congress must work to fulfill its duty to the American people by ensuring the integrity of our elections and safeguarding investigations by allowing them to run their course free from political pressure.  The question is whether the Trump administration and all Members of Congress will choose to act in the best interests of our country and our democracy or whether they will continue to act out of self-preservation and shortsighted political gain.

477,topic-id,916,"Mr.President, I see my good friend the Senator from New Jersey here, and I just want to make a few comments, since I have been at the center of this firestorm.  I am here again to talk about the mess that has been created by the 5-year drilling plan. Some of the reasons I have talked about it so much go beyond the fact that it is disastrous and dangerous, not only for all the coastal States but for our State of Florida, which has more beaches than any other State and is surrounded by test range. Indeed, just today, the largest rocket since the Apollo program to the Moon has brought back two of its boosters that didn't have to fall into the ocean. But some may, and you simply cannot have oil rigs out there in the Atlantic where we are testing our military rockets, such as today--a commercial rocket, the Falcon Heavy, has dropped its initial stages. The same is true with the military on the west coast.  The largest testing and training area for the U.military in the world is the eastern Gulf of Mexico off of That is why it is off limits in law for another 5 years, until the year 2022, and we need to expand that.  Well, my colleagues have endured me so many times as I have talked about how disastrous it would be, but now we have a different wrinkle with the Department of the They first published a proposal that would open up nearly every inch of coastline of the entire United You are hearing all of these coastal Senators speak against it.  They pick up on the eastern gulf off of Florida; since it is off limits in law until year 2022, they pick up there and start wanting to drill out there. Can you imagine what that would do to the U.Air Force, which runs the eastern gulf test range?  Well, look what happened. They published this, and then the very next day--24 hours later--the Secretary of the Interior jetted off to Tallahassee for a 20-minute press conference at the Tallahassee airport and announced that Florida was off the table. It was an obvious, transparent, political stunt, but it created enormous uncertainty about what was truly under consideration for drilling.  What did ``off the table''--in order to try to satisfy Florida's incumbent Governor--mean? Does it apply to the Atlantic coast of Florida, as well, or just to the gulf coast? Is it the whole moratorium area of the eastern gulf? Does it include the Straits of Florida off the delicate Florida Keys, or will it be carved in half to appease the oil industry in the eastern Gulf of Mexico?  The administration--specifically Secretary Zinke--is playing fast and loose with a process that affects millions of people in the State of Florida, and Floridians deserve to know what is going on. That is why I sounded the alarm immediately, within 10 minutes after Secretary Zinke's announcement.  I have been through this process before--ever since I was a young Congressman representing the east coast of Florida--with a Secretary of the Interior, James Watt, who wanted to drill off the east coast of In fact, back then, in the mid-1980s, we were launching our military rockets, just as we do today, and the space shuttle was dropping its solid rocket boosters.  These 5-year plans are supposed to be developed over the course of 1 or 2 years with extensive input from the public, agency staff, the industries involved, and the environmental community. Five-year plans aren't supposed to be a goody bag of political favors, and they can't be undone by the Secretary's press conference or a tweet. That was confirmed by a career employee, Walter Cruickshank, the Acting Director of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy He said that at a House committee hearing. It is no wonder the attorneys general from 12 coastal States wrote to the Secretary to warn him that he should terminate the draft proposal--terminate it entirely--or else they were going to pursue their appropriate legal avenues.  The whole process has been fraught with confusion because it was a political stunt, and as a result, we have a bunch of Senators out here fighting to make known what is happening. At the same time, the Interior Department is trying to open up America's entire coastline to drilling. They are also working to undo all the commonsense safety standards that were put in place after the Deepwater Horizon oilspill that spilled 5 million barrels of oil into the gulf and killed 11 workers on the rig. Those safety standards include requirements like making sure an independent third party, such as a professional engineer, certifies the offshore drilling safety equipment, such as the blowout preventer. That malfunctioned 5 miles below the surface of the gulf when it did not cut off the oil at the wellhead on the floor of the ocean, and it allowed those 5 million barrels to be spilled. Now Secretary Zinke wants to go backward in time and reverse all of those safety standards. The American people deserve better than this. Floridians certainly deserve better than this.  I want to thank my fellow Senators for getting out here and raising such a ruckus so that we can get the American people to focus on what is happening and the political stunts that are being done by the Secretary of the  I yield the floor.

487,topic-id,834,"Mr.President, I have been involved in a number of elections over the years. I love campaigns, and I love campaigning. I have always campaigned in a situation in which you have your opponent, and the people have a chance to make a judgment between you and your opponent as to who can best serve the people. Little did I ever think that I was going to have to fight against the Russians in a campaign. Yet that is what I fully expect, and that is what I expect a number of us who are up in November of this year will be having to do because, in the midst of all of the disinformation that we have seen that the Russians are very good at--all of the fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook, the internet trolls, the botnets--it is critically important that the American people understand this is a fundamental attempt by Russia to influence our very democratic institutions and our critical infrastructure; and our elections, indeed, are a part of that critical infrastructure.  Last year, the intelligence community assessed that when Putin sees his attempt to influence the last election as a success, he is going to do it again. That is what the intelligence community's conclusion was. Then, just last week, the Director of the CIA said that he had every expectation that Russia will meddle in the 2018 midterm elections.  As the Senator from Maryland just said and as the Senator from Rhode Island has already said, this is not a partisan issue. It could happen to both sides. Attempts to influence our elections are attacks on the very foundation of the democracy that we so cherish. That is really what the Russians are trying to do. They are trying to divide us, and they are trying to undermine faith in our democratic institutions. Ultimately, they are trying to undermine American leadership in the world community of nations. The bottom line is we have to do more to protect ourselves, and we have to make Mr.Putin feel enough pain to deter future attacks or else he is going to keep doing it.  Now, this Senator has the privilege of being the ranking member of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Armed Services I must say that this Senator has sat through hearings with people who ought to know, and I have been appalled at how little we have or will have the capability of responding. It is going to take some resolve not only in this Senate, in this Congress, but in this administration, as well, to let Mr.Putin know that he is going to have pain if he continues the attacks that he has already made.  Of course, there is another aspect to this threat, which is that Russia didn't just attack our democracy in America, as has been stated so effectively by previous speakers, but he is in Europe and in Latin America too. Look at what the Russians have done with the Spanish language propaganda television, There is an RT en Espanol that has already targeted upcoming elections in Mexico and Colombia--two of our important partners in the hemisphere. The President's National Security Adviser, General McMaster, said recently that there was already evidence of Russian meddling in  Of course, this points to the Russian effort to destabilize the region. It has sought to gain influence through propaganda, arms sales, trade, and other means to challenge the United States in the Western Hemisphere and to undermine our partnerships, which are critical to our national security. Look at Russia's friends Cuba and  How about Venezuela?  The reality is that Russia is propping up the Maduro dictatorship in For years, the Maduro crowd has stolen and used the state-owned oil company Pe De Vesa to launder money, and Russia has bailed them out. Russian money has helped Maduro to avoid defaulting on debts and payments to bondholders. Meanwhile, look what is happening to the poor people of They are hungry, and they don't have basic supplies. Their children are malnourished, and inflation is rampant. Maduro has undermined any remnants of Venezuela's democracy. He jails opponents and has a corrupt Congress and cracks down on protesters. It is all part of the Russian influence campaign.  As you can see, countering Russian influence is critical for the United States and for the world. It is also important to remember that Putin can't beat us on the ground, that he can't beat us on the sea, and that he can't beat us under the sea. He can't beat us in the air, and he can't beat us in space, but he can beat us in cyber in his propaganda campaign.  Yet Putin--that Russian bear--is not 10-feet tall. As a former Secretary of State just testified last week to our Armed Services Committee, Putin is playing a weak hand, but he is playing it very aggressively. It is time for us, the USA, to push back.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from New  ",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS628-2.txt,859,HONORING HOMETOWN HEROES ACT,2018.0,6.0,February
46,topic-id,290,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank both sides for the bipartisan way in which this bill has proceeded.  Today, the House is doing no more than bringing itself in line with what we have long required of the public sector and Federal agencies.  When I became chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the late 1970s, sexual harassment was not even recognized as a form of employment discrimination.  We remedied that with sexual harassment guidelines, later ratified by the Supreme In drawing the sexual harassment guidelines, it never occurred to us that Congress would adopt special procedures for themselves, preferential to Members and prejudicial to employees.  The antidiscrimination statutes typically require some kind of conciliation before moving forward to avoid excessive litigation, but the current process creates multiple steps and time frames that exhaust complainants and deter resolution.[[Page H808]]  It takes courage to file a sexual harassment complaint because most are unwitnessed and they are difficult to corroborate.  The most important provisions of this bill, I believe, are the provisions for legal assistance to complainants, which Members have long had, and personal liability for sexual harassment lying with the Member, not the taxpayers.  This bill marks the Congress holding itself accountable to the public. However, it is another focus on high-profile workplaces.  I ask the House to move next to the workplaces of America where the average woman and man works--hospitality, factories, offices, retail, and the like. Increasingly, we find sexual harassment is still widespread.  Therefore, I hope the House will pass my bill to create a national commission to hear from ordinary workers so that the average worker gets our equal attention and equal time.  Mr.Speaker, again, I thank the sponsors of this bill and for this bipartisan effort.  ",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgH797-2.txt,868,HONORING HOMETOWN HEROES ACT,2018.0,6.0,February
442,topic-id,293,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1892.  Mr.Speaker, I am disappointed that, once again, my Republican colleagues are playing politics with important health programs.  Rather than bringing a stand-alone, bipartisan health extenders package to the floor, the Republicans have once again delayed any action on these extenders so that they could attach them to a CR that Democrats could not support.  The strategy may hide their inability to pass a final funding bill for a fiscal year that began on October 1, but it has also created uncertainty for the millions of Americans who rely on these programs every day.  I am glad that Republicans have dropped some of the harmful offsets that have led to months of delay and uncertainty for these health programs. However, our main concern is that the package excludes important health priorities, including the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; the Health Profession Opportunity Grants program; and the increased funding that is desperately needed to combat the ongoing opioid crisis.  The CR poses a serious threat to public health because it cuts $2.85 billion from the Prevention These funds are critical to keeping Americans healthy. The Prevention Fund funds vaccines for children, lead poisoning prevention, opioid prevention, diabetes, heart disease, and other prevention programs.  I am also concerned with the Medicaid cuts in this package.

554,topic-id,374,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois for all her work on this and so much other good legislation--not the bill that is on the floor today, though.  I rise in strong opposition to H.772. This bill would undo years of progress towards implementing menu label requirements and only lead to greater consumer and industry confusion.  We included a requirement in the Affordable Care Act that certain restaurants and other retail food establishments with 20 or more locations display calorie and other nutritional information in order to give consumers access to the information they need to make healthy choices in a way that would be consistent and easy to understand.  Now, GOP efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act continue with this legislation today, which also undermines the ACA's prevention goals. Unfortunately, H.772 would weaken the current menu labeling requirements and lead to extended compliance delays, putting those establishments who have already begun complying at a disadvantage.  While proponents of this bill claim it will increase flexibility for covered entities, in reality, this bill would allow restaurants and other retail food establishments to determine their own serving sizes and what would be the one designated menu or menu board for the purposes of disclosing caloric information. It would also permit establishments to disclose nutritional content for certain food items through a choice of methods instead of utilizing a standardized format.  H.772 also would limit the civil liability of covered entities, impeding private citizens' ability to take legal recourse should an establishment fail to comply with the menu labeling requirements.  And as I noted when we considered a similar version of this bill in the last Congress, I continue to believe that legislation is not the right approach to address the concerns raised by some industry groups regarding the menu labeling rule.  The FDA has been diligently working with stakeholders, since the law was passed, to find a workable approach that provides consumers with transparency when eating out, while also ensuring covered establishments have the tools they need to implement the rule.

So we shouldn't roll back the clock and undo the progress we have made.  Instead, we should be moving forward with the menu labeling requirements as they currently stand and are set to go into effect in May of this year.

For 84 percent of the American voters, the economy is the number one issue to care about. Tonight's Special Order is made even more important after the huge drop in the stock market today. But, of course, the stock market is not the only measure of a healthy economy or economics of our community.  Building wealth matters. Wealth is what families accumulate and pass down generation after generation. It is the house you pay for and give to your children so they can grow their families without paying rent.  It is the retirement fund you live off of and pass on to your children so they can pay for their own children's college education. By building wealth, we are building a safety net that allows us to start a business or survive if we lose our jobs. Yes, building wealth matters, but the Black community has been shut out from building its wealth.  More than 25 percent of the Black community has zero net worth or has a negative net worth, and the median Black family is worth 12 times less than the median White family.  Why is that?  One reason for the vast majority of households in the United States, two-thirds of the family's wealth is tied up in the value of their home. That means the racial gap in wealth is mostly a racial gap in housing, and the housing wealth gap is not by chance.  For decades, Federal law and policy favored Whites and discriminated against For decades, private banks discouraged lending to Black people, and for decades, restrictive covenants outright prevented Black people from owning homes in certain areas of town.  There are young people today struggling to rent apartments in major cities because, in 1950, their grandfather was denied a loan by a bank because of his race. The young people of color are, in essence, forced to play catchup with their White colleagues.  To build wealth in Black communities, we need to work towards ending the racial unemployment gap. As the President has repeatedly proclaimed, Black unemployment has been dropping for the past 8 years, reaching a historic low this year, but that statistic doesn't tell the whole story.  While unemployment has gone down, the gap between Black and White pay has not been going down. Black men only earn 70 cents an hour for every dollar a White individual makes. As long as that remains true, our communities will continue to struggle economically.  To close the economic gap, it requires us to close the wage gap. Workers everywhere need to be free to bargain collectively. We need to make unions and their workers stronger, not weaker. We need to raise the minimum wage for both tipped and untipped workers. We need to strengthen the Equal Employment Opportunity  These basic steps will help generate Black wealth by closing the wage gap. Those are a few of the short-term solutions to closing the wealth gap and the wage gap among people who are in the workforce today. But we need a long-[[Page H769]]term plan. We need to increase the participation and the success of Black, Latino, and female students in careers that rely on science, technology, engineering, and math.  Fewer than half of all high schools in the United States offer calculus. Many high schools across the country don't even offer physics or chemistry. And the students who don't have access to senior-level science or math classes are disproportionately students of color or low-income students. This is a national disgrace.  This disparity continues through college, where only 4 percent of engineering majors are Black or African American, and only 8 percent are Hispanic or  Look, the world around us is undergoing rapid change and will continue to evolve, and there is a growing gap between jobs that are in high demand and the people who have the skills to fill them. Over the next 10 years, 80 percent of careers will require a deep understanding of STEM skills, but our young women, Black youth, and people of color are being left behind. They are among the least likely to pursue studies in the most in-demand STEM fields, despite the fact that they are among the fastest growing demographics in the country.  It is our duty to create an educational system that encourages young people, whatever their backgrounds, to dream big, to achieve big. Only then will we be positioned to create a future in which technology reflects the strength of America's diverse communities.  I would just like to say we are here tonight to discuss this matter that has plagued our community for decades, as I stated, but it is time for us to level the playing field once and for all, for all families to be able to benefit from what this country has to offer, the great American  It is a dream for everyone, and we are bent on making sure that all communities have an opportunity to benefit from this great Nation's wealth.

      Whereas the integrity of the legislative process of the      House has been seriously damaged by the Majority's failure to      properly adhere to the procedures of clause 11 (g) of rule X,      of the Rules of the House of Representatives in seeking to      release highly classified information contained in a memo by      the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chair Devin      Nunes to assist the President in attacking the Federal Bureau      of Investigation and undermining ongoing investigations into      Russia's meddling in America's elections;       Whereas the Department of Justice on January 24, 2018      warned Chairman Nunes that releasing his memo without      affording the FBI and the Department an opportunity to review      and advise the Intelligence Committee of risks to our      national security and ongoing investigations would be      ``extraordinarily reckless'';       Whereas on January 29, 2018 after Chairman Nunes refused to      allow the FBI and the Department of Justice to advise the      Intelligence Committee of risks to our national security and      intelligence, the Committee voted on a party-line vote to      release the Nunes memo pursuant to clause 11 (g) of rule x;       Whereas during the business meeting of January 29, 2018,      the Intelligence Committee on a party-line vote refused to      release a memo by the Ranking Member, thereby providing only      a misleading perspective for Members and the public about the      propriety of the FISA court's actions described in the Nunes      Memo;       Whereas on January 31, 2018, the FBI publicly indicated      that the Nunes memo is based upon the distortion of highly      classified information and contains ``material omissions of      fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy'';       Whereas on January 31, 2018, Chairman Nunes transmitted a      memo to the President that contained material changes from      the version that the Intelligence Committee approved on      January 29, 2018, and did so without a vote of the      Intelligence Committee to authorize that particular memo's      release, thereby failing to adhere to the procedures outlined      in clause 11 (g) of rule X and calling into question the      integrity of the legislative and committee process;       Whereas the President's decision to declassify the Nunes      Memo on February 2, 2018 and allow the release of this highly      misleading memo was ``an unprecedented action,'' according to      the Department of Justice;       Whereas House Intelligence Committee Republicans refused to      answer whether Republican Members or staff consulted or      coordinated with the White House in the preparation of the      Nunes memo;       Whereas Administration officials, members of the national      security community and experts across the political spectrum      have debunked and denounced the Nunes memo since its      publication;       Whereas on February 5, 2018 during the Intelligence      Committee's business meeting, a full week after voting to      release only the Committee Republicans' memo and not to      release a separate memo prepared by the Committee's Ranking      Member, the Committee finally voted unanimously to release      the memo by the Ranking Member;       Whereas the record must be set straight by releasing for      public view after appropriate classification review the memo      prepared by the Ranking Member of the Intelligence Committee;      and       Whereas this House must defend our national security and      intelligence before that of any political party or any      President's personal interest: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) the House of Representatives disapproves of Chairman      Nunes transmitting a memo to the President over the objection      from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it was      misleading and inaccurate and that contained material changes      from the version that the Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence approved on January 29, 2018, without a vote of      that committee to authorize that particular memo's release,      in violation of clause 11 (g) of rule X of the Rules of the      House of Representatives; and       (2) it is imperative that the House vote to call upon the      President to expeditiously seek review, by the Department of      Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and process      and release the memo by the Ranking Member of the Permanent      Select Committee on Intelligence, and that the President      declassify such memo without any redactions based on      political considerations, for the sake of America's national      security, the public interest, and the integrity of the      legislative process and ongoing investigations.

Mr.Speaker, Members of Congress take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and protect the American people.

It is imperative that the House vote to release the Democratic memo to set the record straight on Republicans' attempts to undermine the Russian investigation. It is also important to note that who knows what they have next.  The majority's decision to release highly classified and distorted intelligence is profoundly dangerous and gives a bouquet to As the Department of Justice warned, the public[[Page H832]]release of the memo is an unprecedented action and extraordinarily reckless.  The FBI also expressed grave concerns about the material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy. The memo prepared by the House Intelligence Committee's Democrats must be expeditiously released after review and appropriate redaction of sources and methods by law enforcement officials: the Justice Department, the intelligence community.

416,topic-id,1318,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I commend her for her extraordinary leadership on the Appropriations Committee, where important decisions are made about how to allocate the resources of our country to invest in the aspirations of the American people, to respect the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, and to honor the vows of our Founders for a country that is making the future better for every generation to come.  The distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr.Frelinghuysen, opened his remarks by saying he came to the floor to introduce the fifth continuing resolution. And the gentleman who followed him talked about this being the fifth continuing resolution.  The more is not the merrier. It is like golf: the lower the score, the better. To have five continuing resolutions is a statement of incompetence and ineptitude.  The Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House; yet they are pressing forward on their fifth stopgap, short-term spending bill, demonstrating their failure to govern.  Since President Reagan was mentioned, I will mention our very first President, our patriarch, George President Washington, when he was leaving office, cautioned against political parties who were at war with their own government.  Does that sound familiar to you?  Here we are again, 2 days from another shutdown, careening toward another manufactured Republican crisis, demonstrating the Republican failure to govern.  We don't want to go to that place. As Members of Congress, we take a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and to protect the American people.  Democrats support a strong national defense. We, too, want our men and women in uniform to have the resources they need to keep them safe and to keep the American people safe as they accomplish their mission.  But we will not allow Republicans to use this continuing resolution, the fifth time they had to come to the floor because they could not govern, to hollow out our Nation's commitment to the health, education, and economic security of America's working families.  We all know that our military might is part of our Nation's strength, but the health, education, security, and well-being of the American people is also a source of that strength.  Instead of working constructively with Democrats to meet the needs of the American people, Republicans are trying to starve the domestic budget. I just want to remind our colleagues: One-third, 34 percent--one-third--of the nondefense domestic budget goes to national security. When you starve the domestic budget, you are not making us stronger. One-third of the domestic budget is about security; Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, the State Department, and antiterrorism activities of the Justice  But Republicans refuse to give our patriots funded on the domestic side of the budget the resources they need to do their job, just the chaos and uncertainty of yet another stopgap extension.  As Defense Secretary Mattis said, stopgap CRs ``just create unpredictability. It makes us rigid. We cannot deal with new and revealing threats. We know our enemies are not standing still, so it is about as unwise as it can be.'' And here are, as unwise as can be for the fifth time.  And while their continuing resolution seeks to ransack every other commitment to the health of the American people, Republicans hide behind a fig leaf of a 2-year extension of community health centers.[[Page H890]]  We all support community health centers. It was a very important part of the Affordable Care A very important part. Our colleague, assistant leader Mr.Clyburn from South Carolina, was one of the great champions of all time of Congress on expanding funding for programs for care and for bricks and mortar for our community health centers. This is a very important piece for us. We should be extending it in a fuller bill to 5 years, except it is used here to hide from the fact of so much other domestic investment that we are not making.  Republicans are eliminating the Home Visiting initiative that is vital for maternal and child care, and cutting off workforce training for low-income Americans seeking good-paying jobs in healthcare.  The sole purpose of this Republican bill is to destroy our leverage to achieve parity in the caps, to eliminate any need for bipartisan compromise, to eliminate any need to invest in working families.  Why?  Because if they get their defense number, then they don't have to negotiate about the domestic number. And as I said, we support our men and women in uniform having what they need to be safe and to keep us safe. But the strength of our country is measured in other ways as well.  They don't believe that and they can't pass that, so they have to put the defense bill there. But we cannot support that because, again, it comes at the expense instead of as a source of strength to our country.  Democrats simply want action on the critical overdue and bipartisan priorities of the American people so beautifully spelled out by our ranking member, Congresswoman  Again, we need funding for the opioid epidemic. The President talked about that. Show us the money. The opioid epidemic claims the lives of 115 Americans every day, and it is getting worse every year in every district in the country. Bipartisan support is there to fight the opioid epidemic. Let's do it.  We need more funding for veterans, to meet our responsibility and ensure that no veteran is denied the care they deserve upon returning from the battlefield.  We need emergency disaster funding for all communities ravaged by hurricanes and wildfires.  We need to save millions of hardworking Americans' endangered pensions.  We need to pass the bipartisan Dream Act immediately. This is a moral priority for us. This is about the character of our Nation, who we are as a country. A nation, over time, constantly invigorated by people coming to our country to seek the American Dream; a dream that is predicated on every generation working to make the future better for the next; a dream that takes determination, optimism, hope, and courage. And when these newcomers come to America with that determination, that courage, that optimism, that hope, they associate themselves with the values of our Founders to make the future better for the next generation. These newcomers to America make America more  So we asked to bring the Hurd-Aguilar bill to the floor. It is bipartisan. It has bipartisan support on the floor. It would pass. Have the courage to bring a bill that protects the DREAMers to the floor of the  These priorities that I mentioned are all bipartisan. They would pass if brought to the floor for an up-or-down vote. The GOP squandered all their time, energy, votes, and enthusiasm on tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest, with 83 percent of the tax bill going to the top 1 percent. And now Republicans need to get serious and get to work on a budget that funds both the military and the domestic investments that keep our Nation strong.  I just want to make one point about that tax bill again. Did you see that the Speaker of the House sang the glory of the tax bill because a woman was getting $1.50 a week more in her paycheck? Did you see that? Do you believe that that is a good thing when the top 1 percent were probably getting $1,500 a week compared to her $1.50 a week in their paycheck?  Thank God, after millions of people objected, the Speaker withdrew that tweet. But I don't think he withdrew that sentiment, because it is the same sentiment that haunts all of these negotiations about investing in the American people.  Republicans must stop governing from manufactured crisis to crisis, and work with Democrats to pass many urgent, long-overdue priorities of the American people.

599,topic-id,639,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Hawaii for the time.  I rise today as well in support of H.2504, a bill that will end the practice of duplicative export inspections for sea urchin and sea cucumbers that are being shipped overseas.  This is the second time that the House has considered this legislation in recent years. I want to thank Chairman Bishop; Subcommittee Chairman Lamborn; Ranking Member Grijalva; and my good friend from California, Ranking Member Huffman, for their support in bringing this bill again to the floor today.  I also want to thank my colleague from Arizona (Mr.Gosar) for being here to speak in favor of this bill today.  Also, in the bipartisan effort that we are making here today, I want to recognize and thank my colleague from Maine (Mr.Poliquin), who well knows the importance of this issue and who has been an original cosponsor of this bill, both in this Congress and the last.  I think it is important to explain to the Members who are here today a little bit about why this bill is important and especially critical to our Nation's sea urchin industry.  As a few Members may know, but most probably don't, the sea urchin industry in Maine brings in over $5.4 million to our State every year. It supports 600 jobs, which includes harvesters of the species. Also, we have businesses in Maine which process the urchins harvested here, as well as those imported from Canada and Chile, before being exported overseas.  The need for this bill revolves around ending a duplicative inspection of exported product that is unnecessary and costly. Urchins imported to Maine from other countries to be processed are inspected by the U.Fish and Wildlife Service when they get to the United This scrutiny is necessary to ensure the integrity of the imported products.  However, in recent years, the Fish and Wildlife Service has inspected products once again before leaving the country, usually in New York or New This occurs before they are shipped to Asia and Japan, in particular, where they are considered a delicacy.  I have spent the past few years working with my colleagues in the Maine delegation to better understand the impact of this policy on small businesses in our State and others where the urchins are harvested. I believe these extra inspections are unnecessary. There is really no reason why sea urchins should be treated differently than shellfish, which have been exempted from these export inspections for decades.  This process often leads to costly delays and lost product, as urchins may end up sitting in hot warehouses waiting for days. At times, the Fish and Wildlife office closes right when a shipment arrives for inspection. The highly perishable product must then sit there because of bad timing.  The Fish and Wildlife Service has worked with my office to try to find solutions, and I know they have tried to work with us on particular problems and trouble spots. But the continual delays, despite their best efforts and that of harvesters, means that the only real solution is to get rid of this duplicative inspection. Again, that is what this bill will do.  This bill is a commonsense solution that will take away an unnecessary inspection, while ensuring that the Fish and Wildlife Service can continue to do their work and their jobs on other important issues affecting our coast and coastal communities.  It will put our sea urchin and sea cucumber businesses on equal footing with their partners in the shellfish industry who do not have this extra scrutiny.

I rise as a proud cosponsor and strong supporter of H.4924, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act; and 724, the companion resolution which strengthens antiharassment and antidiscrimination policies and procedures in this institution.  These two bills show how Congress can make dramatic progress on a bipartisan basis when we listen to the people; specifically, the Me Too movement against workplace discrimination and harassment that has swept America into the 21st century by demanding equality and dignity in the workplace for all women as well as all men.  This continuing Women's March Across America for workplace fairness has forced the Members of this body to acknowledge that, here in Congress, sexual harassment has been a serious occupational hazard for thousands of women who only want to come to work to support their families and to contribute to the common good of the country.  We have heard about shameful cases of quid pro quo harassment, hostile workplace environment, groping, forcible kissing, sexual coercion, and reprisal and retaliation for saying no or complaining.  As the representatives of the American people, we have a compelling obligation to lead America to a culture of zero tolerance for sexual harassment and assault in the workplace; and we, in Congress, must lead, not only by strong legislation, but by strong example.  Our current dispute resolution process is stacked against victims, requiring people to go through a protracted and duplicative process. Members are provided legal counsel, while victims are left to navigate this convoluted process on their own. Settlements, if provided, are paid for with taxpayer money instead of the money of the perpetrators of the events.  This legislation eliminates protracted mandatory waiting periods. It empowers victims to move directly to a court proceeding if they so desire. It creates an Office of Employee Advocacy with lawyers on hand to help people understand their rights.

214,topic-id,2138,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for yielding to me.  Mr.Speaker, let me take a moment to congratulate the city of Philadelphia, the great people of Pennsylvania, on winning the Super Bowl last night. And I will just say, as we talk about economic justice, one of the reasons why Philadelphia or the Eagles were able to win the Super Bowl was not just because of their outstanding player Malcolm Jenkins, which they all got from the New Orleans Saints, but part of the reason why is because the rules are the same for everybody. When the rules are the same for everybody, then you get rewarded for your hard work, your dedication, your sacrifice, and all of those things. Last night was the reward of the Eagles' hard work, dedication, and sacrifice.  The problem with what we face in this country is that the rules are not the same for everybody, which is why it takes an African American to have a high school diploma and some college education to earn what a White dropout makes. And, look, it is what it is. It is the rules we find ourselves. But in a great nation such as this, you correct it so that the playing field is even and that the rules are the same.  Some people are born on third base. They hit a single and think they hit a home run and earned all of their success. So often in minority communities, we go to the plate already with two strikes, and we are expected to hit that same home run or that same single.  Well, this morning, as I prepared to say good-bye to my 3-year-old--little Cedric--and drop him off at daycare and go to the airport so that I could fly up here and do the people's work, I noticed that the CBC was getting criticized for not standing when the President said that African-American unemployment was at an all-time low. I am grown. I accept what I do. To my colleague from Pennsylvania: No, I didn't stand.  But for anyone who is listening--and I hope that the White House is--why don't you just call me and ask me why I didn't stand?  Because I will tell you, and I don't care if it hurts some feelings, ruffles some feathers, or send people in a little tizzy.  I didn't stand because we haven't done enough. I didn't stand because Black unemployment has been going down since 2011 at a steady rate. The decline this past year is less than the decline in other years.  But if I stood and applauded, it would make someone think that I was happy. It would make someone think that he was doing a good job.  I also didn't stand because I just didn't believe the words that I was hearing.  I also didn't stand because I could hear the words of my grandmother in the back of my head saying: ``Baby, he means you no good.''  But part of the other reasons why I didn't stand was because, in a country as great as this, I was sitting there that night--and I am a Southern boy--and I was thinking about how cold it was outside while we were in here listening to the State of the Union; and when the weather gets really cold and it is snowing or it is raining and cold, I try to bundle up so I can hurry up and get in my car, and then hurry up and get in the office, and then hurry up and get in the house so that I don't have to be exposed to the elements long.  Do you know what I realized?  That there are people in this great country who go to bed and wake up[[Page H771]]outside. We can't consider ourselves a great nation if that is true.  The other thing I realized is that there are mothers who go to work every day and they bust their tails to provide for their kids, and at the end of the week, they still don't have enough to make ends meet. But she is working for a corporation whose profits are at an all-time high, while her wages are at an all-time low. She is making the corporation a profit, but she can't pay for the basic needs for her family. You can't be a great country when that happens.  So what does she do?  Not to mention that she has to work two jobs to earn what a White male makes. So she is working two jobs to make what a White male makes. Then we criticize her for not educating her children. Well, she can't help with homework. She is working her second job.  But in this country, we have to be better than that. So to stand and give a State of the Union and just look at the unemployment rate really means you are looking at it like a 3-year-old.  Part of our job as the CBC--the Congressional Black Caucus--is to educate, which is why we did prepare this document.  And, look, White House, if it is too long, if it is too complicated, if the words are too big, call me. I will send you the cliff notes version. Lord knows I used them once or twice in school.  But I will tell you: If you want to know our solutions, it is on page 17. If you want to hear us talk about economic justice and how to improve the economy, it is on page 31. If you want to know how to improve education and the workforce and healthcare, those are pages 40, 43, and 49.  If you want to talk about rural America--because, as the CBC, I want to make this crystal clear to the country: Yes, we are the Congressional Black Caucus, but we work for the entire country. So when we start talking about solutions, we are talking about solutions for rural America, like investing in infrastructure, broadband, and all those things, so rural people, both Black or White or any other race, can succeed.  But what most of the country doesn't know is, yes, we have 48 members of the Congressional Black Caucus; we represent 78 million people, but only 17 million of those are African So we fight for the entire country. So when we marched in the civil rights movement, and when the CBC fought for a civil rights bill, and a voting rights bill, they weren't just fighting for African First of all, they were fighting to redeem this country's soul because it was so lost. We find ourselves at a similar place in history where we are fighting to redeem this country. We are here to help you save you from yourself because in this country, with the wealth that we have, we should not have the poverty.                              {time}  2015  I want to be clear about another thing. I applaud the fact that people make a lot of money. Look, I think it is absolutely phenomenal.  There is a guy in California right now building a 100,000-square-foot house for $500 million. God bless him, and God bless this country that he is able to make that much money.  But you can't tell me that, in the same country where he is able to do that, we can't take care of a hungry 3-year-old or a hungry 4-year-old or help that mother who is working two jobs to make ends meet. And because she is getting subsidized rent, we have the nerve to call her lazy?  No one in this body works two jobs. First of all, we are prohibited. But we don't work two jobs, and there are too many families all across this country where people are working two and three jobs.  You hear me talk about civil rights often, and you hear me talk about King often--not only because he was one of the greatest leaders ever in this country; not only because he went to Morehouse College, the greatest institution in this country; but because his words had meaning and, more importantly, his actions and his deeds were those that changed this country.  So let's think, as April 4 we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of his assassination in Memphis at the Lorraine What people don't realize about King, he was down there fighting for sanitation workers. He was fighting for people who woke up every day, got on the back of a truck. We call them ``hoppers.'' They would hop on and hop off the truck, put your trash in it, worked very hard, but they didn't work with decent wages, decent work conditions, or anything else.  He was down there not fighting for chronic voters, not pandering to a base, not trying to appeal to what is popular; he was down there fighting for garbage men and garbage women so that they could work with dignity and respect. That is what the CBC embodies.  So I am so glad that tonight the gentleman is leading this Special Order Hour on economic justice. I know I went all over the place, but I want people to understand.  First of all, I am not apologetic for not standing. Make me. Make me stand. And I am not talking about in a physical sense. That is too easy. All these sergeant-at-arms around here and all the security that the President has, yeah, they can make me stand, but make me want to stand.  See, that is what makes this country great. Anybody, any little infant in this country can criticize. There are a whole bunch of people who criticize. Oh, they won't stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or the Star-Spangled What makes this country great is that they don't have to if they want to protest.  But this country is so great, we should make people want to stand. We should make those players feel not that they are sons of Bs, but that they are contributing members of society and that we cherish every community; that we are going to actually talk about police misconduct, not just from the White House where we get--you are in the White You get to beat up on the FBI, the You get to beat up on all law enforcement, and nobody says a word. But if one little football player says that police relations in my community are so bad that, no, I am not going to talk about the FBI publicly, I am not going to criticize them, I am just going to, in a very reverent way, take a knee to show that I am not happy with police community relations in my community, all of a sudden they are despicable people. But you can stand and sit in the White House and tweet about the FBI, CIA, and everyone else, and all of a sudden it is acceptable.  So, look, the rules should be the same for everybody. The solutions we have in this book, like investing in the minority business development agencies, those would make a real difference in the lives of African Americans achieving better. But what did this budget do? Propose to cut them out completely.  So we just have to be very cognizant of where we are, what we are doing, and know that you have to have a plan. Economic injustice will not cure itself because it wasn't created overnight.  I know I am probably way over the heads of all the people in the White House, but we learn in physics that, if a ball is rolling downhill, the only way you stop it from rolling downhill is to apply equal or greater force in the opposite direction.  So if we know that discrimination and racism and injustice has been involved in our economic system since the slaves built this hallowed building, then we know that that discrimination and that inequality has been rolling down the hill for centuries. So if it has been rolling down the hill for centuries, then we need an equal or greater force to meet it.  That is what this document is. It is saying, ``Mr.President, implement these policies.'' That will be the equal or greater force to meet that. All of a sudden, we have an equal playing field and we have a chance to make this a more perfect Union, what we all strive for, so that little Black boys and little Black girls can be judged by their character, not by the color of their skin. That is what we strive for. Too often, too many politicians forget it because they are pandering to chronic voters and to a base.

216,topic-id,478,"Mr.Speaker, I tell the gentleman from Pennsylvania, how you describe the state of our Union depends on what ZIP Code you live in in this country these days. There are ZIP Codes where the state of our Union is great, where people are overjoyed that the stock market was over 25,000, that they are bustling because of the economic recovery that was started under President They are doing very well, and they did very well as we ended the Great  But there are too many people in other ZIP Codes who still find themselves without raises in the last 10 years, but the cost of gas, the cost of milk, the cost of electricity, all those costs are going up. All of your expenses are going up, but your salary is staying the same. That does not make for a balanced balance sheet. That makes for a deficit, which is why we talked about and challenged the tax cut that we just did.  We just spent $1.4 trillion. Bernie Sanders' free college plan was only $800 billion. We could have done his free college plan and still had $600 billion left over to do infrastructure or something else, because the best way out of poverty and the best way to do these things is through investing in education.  So the state of our Union is divided, is fractured; for vulnerable people, it is scary. They are anxious. For too many people, they are angry.  We have pitched this whole idea in this country that if you are poor and you are White, the only reason you are poor is because minorities keep cutting the line and keep taking what should be yours. And to perpetuate that doesn't help poor White people or poor Black people because, at the end of the day, they are both poor, and we need to realize that that is not what this country is about, and we need to uplift both.  That is why I would say the state of our Union is in paralysis, and we are paralyzed in a broke state. But it is our job, the Members of this House, all 435, to figure out ways to come together to fix it. We know we have very specific ideas. We know that they have very specific ideas. They won the majority, and elections have consequences.  But if you want to talk to me in good faith about finding a solution, then be open to hearing what you don't want to hear. I am open to not getting everything I want because I know that we didn't win the  But this institution has to be better than that.

Corporations, the profits are at an all-time high; wages are at an all-time low. We ought to have a better balance than that.

221,topic-id,506,"Not yet. Not yet is the short answer.  Let me say this, Representative Evans, as I close. You mentioned that where we are from it is all about the Benjamins, which means the Ben Franklins, the money dedicated to the resources.  Far too often--and I challenge a lot of the norms and customs and sayings in our community that I think are harmful. One of the sayings we used to hear a lot was, ``if it doesn't make dollars, it doesn't makes sense,'' which means that, if it makes money, it makes sense.                              {time}  2030  But the true saying should be: if it only makes dollars, then it doesn't make sense.  There has to be something else to it besides just corporations making as much as they possibly can. There still has to be some sort of community obligation that goes along with it to make the communities you are in a little bit better, whether it is the schools; whether it is the housing; whether it is the streets, the roads, the bridges, all of those things.  So when you start talking about our infrastructure, the question becomes: Are corporations paying their fair share? They benefit from our labor, they benefit from our consumers, they benefit from a whole bunch of things. But if it is only about the dollars for them, then this country has lost its soul, which is why we are having this conversation, because we have to save it from itself.  And it is not the first time this country has lost its soul. During slavery, during Jim Crow, during segregation, there were many people who woke up every day, went to church, prayed to the Lord, and then at the end of the day went right back to perpetuate Jim[[Page H773]]Crow, segregation, slavery, racism, and all of those things. But it takes brave people to stand up and call it for what it is.  If you don't diagnosis the problem, you will never find a cure for it. So even in this House, we have people who claim to be the Christian right or the religious right who will say and espouse very hateful and racist things, all in the guise of religion.  But it is our duty as the CBC, and me as the chair, to remind people, one, that we are better than that, and, two, we have done an awful lot of despicable things in this country and blamed it on religion or blamed it on the Lord and don't blame religion or the Lord for wicked men. It is our obligation to make sure that we call it when we see it and we continue to fight for the least of these. Because the least of these can't afford lobbyists. They can't run commercials on TV congratulating people. They can't run commercials on TV opposing candidates. All they can do is continue to bust their tails every day to try to put a roof over their head, food on their table, and all of those things.

A lot of what the Senator has indicated I feel as well in terms of the reason why we came here and the focus we should have. In fact, I think one of the most important things we can do as Members of this institution, Members of this body, is to show respect for one another and defend one another in our responsibility to try to find a way forward.

139,topic-id,1643,"Mr.President, it is in that spirit that I bring this message to my fellow Members of the U.I rise today to ask for support for the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018.  I would like to start by thanking the majority leader for bringing the Defense appropriations bill to the floor. Now, just because the majority leader brings it to the floor doesn't mean we will necessarily get the opportunity to debate it. It requires either the unanimous consent of all the Members or at least 60 Members agreeing to have that debate. That is one of the reasons why we haven't had any appropriations measures on the floor. It takes 60 Members, Republicans and Democrats, just to begin the debate of each one of these 12 separate appropriations bills, which make up what we normally vote on during a year. This is also part of that process which has been broken for more than 44 years because it has only worked four times in 44 years. But you have to start someplace.  Providing long-term funding stability for our Armed Forces is vital to their ability to adequately train, equip, and maintain the force. In particular, under short-term, stop-gap funding measures known as continuing resolutions, which we are operating under right now, the Defense Department is restricted from starting new programs. These new programs are ones that we have already authorized through the National Defense Authorization Act on a bipartisan basis for 2018; we just haven't appropriated the money yet so that they can actually do the programs we have already agreed as a body are important to have in place. This is very concerning to me because in today's rapidly changing threat environment, these programs were designed to protect our Nation against those new threats.  If we are to adequately recover readiness levels that were lost over the last 8 years--really, in many cases, due to sequestration--as well as to modernize our Armed Forces in this increasingly dangerous and complex world, we must give them the funding, stability, and certainty that continuing resolutions fail to provide.  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Readiness, I am pleased that the subcommittee has held two hearings this year on our services' readiness posture. To put that in non-DC terms, it means just exactly what their conditions are right now and their need for modernization.  Today, I would like to share just a few examples of readiness issues facing our military force. The first are issues plaguing our Navy, and both demonstrate the need to adequately fund not only our Navy but all branches of our Armed  The first issue concerns the F/A-18 Hornet aircraft. For any Members who are wondering which aircraft it is, this is the one that people see on a regular basis on film clips and so forth showing them taking off of the carriers. This is our primary Navy attack aircraft. This is the one that we use for aerial combat. We also use this one to do the attacks in both Iraq and  The first issue is plaguing our Navy--and what they do is they demonstrate the need to adequately fund not only our Navy but, as I said, all of the different branches. So this is not only the Navy; all of the branches need this assistance.  Vice Chief of Naval Operations, ADM William Moran, stated that our legacy F/A-18A and D Hornets today take twice as many manhours as originally planned for repairs and maintenance. He has also stated that ``on a typical day in the Navy, about 25 to 30 percent of our jets and our airplanes are in some kind of depot maintenance.'' Overall, just over half are unavailable for operations today. So it is not just the F/A-18 Hornet, it is all of their aircraft that are in need of upgrading.  To sum up the Admiral's comments, the Navy is putting in twice the maintenance manhours to maintain a fleet that is less than 50 percent available.  In a crisis situation, the Vice Chief said, ``We can and we do put airplanes and ready air crews forward,'' but ``there's no depth on the bench behind them if we had to surge forces.'' In other words, all of the aircraft that are available right now, we have on the frontlines. These are the ones that are serving overseas. We don't have backups in case they start to go down.  The Marine Corps is also experiencing serious readiness issues with its F/A-18 fleet, and there is a human cost. On December 8, 2016, the Marine Corps announced that yet another pilot had been killed as a result of a training accident in the F/A-18 This was the third Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet class A mishap--which is defined as an accident resulting in a death or the complete loss of aircraft--over a month-and-a-half time period. In the previous 22 months, the Marine Corps had experienced seven class A mishaps flying legacy F/A-18 Sadly, some or all of these mishaps might have been avoided with the additional training and maintenance that would have been forthcoming with the additional funding that had been recommended in the National Defense Authorization Act, which this body, on a bipartisan basis, has already voted on.  Returning to the Navy, its maintenance-related readiness concerns extend to its attack submarine fleet. Admiral Moran recently mentioned that attack submarines are sometimes sent to private shipyards for maintenance because government shipyards are already at capacity with higher priority work, especially and specifically on aircraft carriers and ballistic missiles submarines, but the private shipyards do not have the capacity to take on extra repair work. This lack of shipyard capacity is severely impacting our attack submarine fleet.  For example, the USS Albany, which is an attack submarine, spent 48 months in the repair yard due to repeated delays as the workforce focused its attention on aircraft carriers and on ballistic missile submarines. That means an entire crew spent years waiting for a deployment that never came.  Worse still, the USS Boise attack submarine wasn't even put in the shipyard last summer because the shipyard workload was so far over workforce capacity. As a result, that boat is currently sitting in Norfolk, VA, and is not certified to dive while it awaits maintenance. This is a taxpayer asset sitting at dock tied up, not being repaired, not even being worked on. Right now, it is so far out of shape, it is not even allowed to dive. In fact, the Boise will not be able to rejoin the fleet until 2020 or later. That means this vital Navy asset will be unavailable for at least another 48 months.  In fact, a maintenance backlog has docked 15 nuclear-powered attack submarines for a total of 177 months--or almost 15 years--in which those attack submarines have not been available in the protection of our country.  While I am discussing some serious Navy readiness challenges, all of our services face readiness challenges.  Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson recently said:       The fiscal year 2018 continuing resolution is actually      delaying our efforts to increase readiness of the force, and      risk accumulates over time. We are stretching the force to      the limit, and we need to start turning the corner on      readiness.  With a shortage of nearly 2,000 pilots, out of about 20,000 total, Secretary Wilson went on to say, current Active-Duty pilots were burning out because the Air Force was too small for what the Nation is asking.  ``Our biggest need right now is for a higher and stable budget to provide security and solvency for the nation,'' she went on to say.  According to Defense Secretary James Mattis, operating under a continuing resolution for 2018 runs the risk of delaying vital projects and increasing their costs, including 37 Navy projects, 16 Air Force projects, and 38 Army projects. The projects that could be impacted include progress on new trainer aircraft, weapons systems, and important training programs.  The most important things Congress can do to solve these problems are to provide funding stability and avoid arbitrary budget caps that constrain defense spending below that which is required to protect our This bill that is before us now does both. More specifically, only by removing these caps can we avoid the Department of Defense having to make difficult choices that are so devastating for our Armed In particular, we must avoid their having to make the false choice of paying for readiness while assuming the risk for modernization or vice versa.  The American people expect us to adequately defend America next year[[Page S627]]and for every year to come. This requires us to put an end to continuing resolutions and remove arbitrary budget caps and the threat of sequestration. Only by doing so can Congress fulfill its 1 responsibility: keeping Americans safe.  I conclude by again thanking the majority leader for bringing the fiscal year 2018 Defense appropriations bill to the floor. He can't do it alone. He needs our cooperation. He needs our understanding as to just how critical this is. If there is not unanimous consent to move forward, it will require 60 of us to agree. It is time to bring this bill to the floor for full debate and passage.  I ask all of my colleagues to support it, get it to the President's desk as soon as possible, and finally bring an end to the defense component of a continuing resolution that, with arbitrary budget caps, is so severely impacting the readiness of our Armed  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS626.txt,2288,CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995 REFORM ACT,2018.0,6.0,February

The Great Gatsby, page 1. This was one of      my father's favorite quotes when I was growing up. He always      cautioned me to think before I spoke or better yet, ``think      before you think.'' While some might call this inauthentic,      my father called it sensible.       I am not blind to the privilege I possess. Though, living      in the big house atop the hill with my two healthy, living      parents in the sheltered town of Weybridge, Vermont, it would      be an easy thing to forget--if it weren't for my brother,            Robbie does not talk much. He cannot read. He cannot write.      He has ``Severe, Regressive Autism,'' a developmental      disorder that inhibits his literacy and communication skills.      When I was younger, my parents explained to me that the world      looked different to It was louder, brighter and so      much bigger. Living with Robbie, I am constantly reminded of      my privilege. Every time I speak, run, ski, read, write . . .      I'm doing something that he cannot. All the things I do on a      daily basis are insurmountable obstacles to him. Yet, even      without these luxuries, my brother smiles and laughs--he      enjoys his life and his experience because he owns it. No one      should be allowed to take that from him.       Yet, my brother's access to the care he needs has decreased      immensely in the last year. His weekly appointments with his      occupational therapist, which used to be covered by      insurance, are now unaffordable as my parents must continue      supporting him in their retirement. Learning this, I was      upset. How could something so fundamental be removed from our      insurance policy without a second thought?       In our society, mental health challenges are often      dismissed as illegitimate and fixable. Words like psycho,      idiot and lunatic, are thrown around as diminutive insults      rather than seen as impactful and potentially harmful.      Because of this, mental healthcare is considered a luxury      rather than a necessity, and therefore not something that      should be covered by insurance.       The union we live in does not value mental healthcare      simply because society does not. This issue starts with us. I      cannot stay silent and watch my parents sacrifice my      brother's future stability and independence in order to be      able to support him in the long run; nor can I do this alone.      I know that until society begins placing value on the lives      of people like Robbie, no one will--especially not large-     scale insurance providers. However, I believe that there are      other people like me who, if we band together, can create a      small group of thoughtful, committed citizens ready to take      on the world. For, unlike my brother, my privilege has given      me a voice, and it is my duty to use it to fight for him. I      owe him that much.                jackson noel, milton high school, senior       With a nation as large as the United States there is a      constant stream of issues and problems that require      addressing. This means that the most important issues are      those that involve the largest portion of the United States      population. In that way, the biggest issue that the United      States should currently focus on is making sure that every      American can afford and has access to health care.       Every American should have the right to health care, as      wealth should not determine quality of life. Health care is      an incredibly important aspect of everyone's lives as it      allows them to live without worrying about not having access      to critical care and treatment to thrive. In this way, the      solution to this problem is the maintaining and constant      adjusting of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,      ``ACA'', to best suit and assist the American people. The      benefit of the Affordable Care Act is deceptively simple in      that more Americans would be able to afford and hold onto      healthcare. This means that they would be able to live a      better life and be better functioning members of society. The      Affordable Care Act has proven to be a legitimate solution      since it has been enacted under the Obama administration.      According to the New York Times, the number of Americans      without healthcare is ``down by 25 percent.'' This shows that      the Affordable Care Act is effective at achieving its goals.       There are many people who believe that the United States      government should play no role in health care; this is a      flawed perspective. The goal is insure as many American      citizens as possible it makes the most sense to have defined      government regulation. One belief is that there should be a      free market for health insurance, allowing companies to      compete to provide the best system to benefit the people.      There are many problems with a free market health care system      that stops it from being helpful and most useful for the      American people. A free market is not designed to allow for      everyone to have insurance, but rather people who can afford      it having better access. This is not beneficial on the      national scale and leads to a large imbalance of power. There      are also numerous flaws in the current American approach to      health care. For one, even when someone is insured there are      upfront fees and payments before insurance kicks in. This      means that someone who is insured might not be able to pay      these fees causing them to be financially burdened by bills      even with insurance.       Universal government health care has proven to be a      sufficient solution to the problem of health care. For      example, Switzerland has universal health care and a per      capita health expenditures of $1,879, compared to America's      $4,160. Meaning that the United States is spending more money      on less.       Making sure that this is available and maintained under the      Trump administration is important in the path towards      accessible health insurance. No one should ever die because      they cannot afford treatment.            hope petraro, montpelier high school, sophomore       Commitment to democracy is the founding principal of the      United States of America-embedded in the fabric of our      Nation, the crown jewel of our proverbial crown. A      constitutional federal republic, with a system of checks and      balances, is an assurance to constituents that they each have      a seat at the table. Yet in practice, this has proven to be      nothing but a promising facade. Gerrymandering, voter      suppression, and ``money in politics'' are not a threat to      our democracy--they define American democracy. The      disproportionate influence of wealthy individuals and      corporations in elections and in the legislative process has      muddled an honest definition of democracy in our Nation while      simultaneously becoming it. However, America's commitment to      tried-and-true methods does not necessitate lack of reception      to positive change.       Campaigns will always include campaign financing, as the      distribution of information to voters is dependent upon      systems that require funding. In addition, campaign      contributions, whether by individuals or corporations, can      rightfully be considered an exercise of the First Amendment      right to free speech. However, refusal to set donation limits      violates the grounds of equality upon which such freedom of      speech is conducted, and can arguably censor and repress the      speech of the less wealthy as it greatly diminishes their      relative influence. Unfortunately, Citizens United and the      subsequent SpeechNow allow donors to make unlimited donations      to super This includes money donated by foreign      entities, possibly anonymously as ``dark money''. Moreover,      these expenditures aren't verifiably independent from      candidates. Collusion between super PACs, often created by      associates of candidates and candidates themselves, is      rarely, if ever, regulated. In addition, it is hypocritical      to argue, in the name of free speech, that donors can      contribute an unlimited amount to expenditures but that those      expenditures must remain independent. Citizens United,      SpeechNow, and the additional McCutcheon rulings have nearly      neutralized the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, adding a      somewhat plutocratic influence upon the electoral process and      American democracy as a whole.       This issue is multi-partisan. According to Gallup Poll, the      greatest majority of Americans cite dissatisfaction with the      government and poor leadership as our Nation's most important      issue. A September 2015 Bloomberg poll found that about 80      percent of Republicans and Democrats alike oppose Citizens      This overarching dissatisfaction can be ameliorated      by working[[Page S649]]     to keep elections in the hands of the American people.      Political groups, such as the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth      and ALEC, were able to influence elections before Citizens      United, SpeechNow, and McCutcheon, and are able to influence      the legislative process, respectively. However, it's      important for Americans to avoid demoralization,      understanding that the first step to achieving a republic      free of corruption rests in truly democratic elections. A      true democracy can be achieved by restoring the Bipartisan      Campaign Reform Act, strengthening campaign-finance      regulations, and supporting public campaign-financing      initiatives. We, the American people, must decide our      destiny, and our elections should remind each American that      their voices prevail.          zoe prue, champlain valley union high school, junior       The United States is distinguished by the values that are      deeply embedded in our culture and economy. Americans place      emphasis on individual initiative and self-created success.      These ideas are evident in the Constitution, its amendments,      and various institutions. Their derivation is best seen in a      famous phrase written in the Declaration of Independence,      ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' Captured in      these seven words are the ubiquitous values of our       Our focus on individually created prosperity is manifested      by capitalism and the free market. However, these are not      conducive to always guaranteeing protections like health care      for our most vulnerable citizens. In America, there are      families stymied in an unrelenting cycle of poverty, and they      are incapable of rising out of the cycle for a myriad of      factors. For example, access to education and vocational      training, discrimination--especially for marginalized      communities--higher incarceration rates, low salaries/wages,      and lack of jobs. Impoverished people have difficulties      paying for the bare minimums like housing, food, and heat.      Consequently, families rarely find any spare money to spend      on healthcare.       This is an issue because, according to the National Center      for Children in Poverty, 15 million children in the United      States live below the federal poverty line. There are      millions of children who do not receive regular physical      check-ups, necessary optometry appointments, or dental care.      Children and adolescents are suffering from health problems      that impact their quality of life. Many treatable ailments      require simple fixes such as glasses to see the board,      fillings for painful cavities, medicine for illnesses, or      inhalers for asthma. It is within our capacity to fix these      problems, so why are we not? We should be concerned about the      health of our Nation's citizens as it is one of the most      important issues facing the U.today.       There is an inescapable need for affordable and accessible      health care for the American public. The lasting impacts of      affordable healthcare would be monumental. When we invest in      the health and livelihoods of the next generation of      Americans, we are investing in the next generation of our      workforce. Healthier people results in more able workers, who      by extension, are able to support their own families. It is      one of the best methods to combatting the poverty cycle.       We characterize our Nation by our belief in individualism      and independence. However, when we see a system that is      relentlessly unforgiving towards people in poverty, the most      productive conclusion to come to is that we have to start      taking care of our neighbors. The cycle disempowers them; it      strips them of the ability to pay for necessities like      healthcare. This is why affordable healthcare needs to be      obtainable for all       Instead of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act,      it should be expanded upon. The government should fund      programs to offer reasonably priced healthcare to      Doing so would create a lasting solution to poor citizens      being unable to access health care. The quality of life for      millions of Americans would be improved.             ethan schmitt, rutland high school, sophomore       I am the grandson of a card-carrying member of the National      Rifle I support the United States Constitution      and all of its amendments. Despite this, I believe that the      way our country's officials have interpreted the Second      Amendment has created the foundation for many mass shootings,      which have claimed the lives of countless innocent civilians.       A price cannot be assigned for the lives lost due to this      awfully dangerous policy of our country; every time another      person dies due to homicide, another family is torn apart.      Many children have been killed, particularly in church and      school shootings. And even in cases where there are children      who haven't been physically impacted by the mass shootings,      they may have lost a loved one which will take a toll on them      mentally and emotionally for the rest of their lives.       The universal definition of the term mass shooting is when      four or more people are injured or killed in a single event      at the same time and location. According to The Guardian,      there have been 1,516 mass shootings in the past 1,735 days      before October 1, 2017, the date of the mass shooting that      took place at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las A total of      1,719 people have died as a result of these mass shootings,      while an additional 6,510 were injured. The gun at the      forefront of these mass shootings was the semi-automatic      rifle, which has the ability to shoot a round, and      automatically reload with another round that is fired with an      additional pull of the trigger. Despite the National Rifle      Association's attempts to defend such a weapon as a gun      mostly used for hunting purposes, there is no need for this      hazardous assault weapon in order to successfully hunt.       In addition, devices known as bump stocks are used to      simulate the speed of fire similar to that of an automatic      weapon for a semi-automatic weapon. An automatic weapon has      the ability to fire multiple rounds of ammunition by only      pulling the trigger of a gun once, and are more commonly      known as machine guns. The American people have been      prohibited from the use of these weapons with the passing of      the National Firearms Act in 1934. However, bump stocks have      not been banned, and the result of this have been conflicts      such as the mass shooting in Las Vegas where the gunman      successfully attached these devices to 23 of his semi-     automatic rifles, and used them to kill 58 people, which      resulted in the most devastating shooting in U.history.       The solution to this mass shooting epidemic is clear.      Congress must use rationality and act as a bipartisan group      to pass a bill which regulates the use of semi-automatic      weapons and bump stocks which have both been used with      frequency in a multitude of mass shootings across the United      American citizens have the right to bear arms, but      not with weapons that have no purpose in hunting, target      practice, or even self-defense.     elizabeth toensing, champlain valley union high school, junior       On a summer Saturday morning, I was driving into      At a stop light, I looked over at a church to my      right. A man, in his early twenties was sitting on the steps.      He was shivering ferociously, yelling at God, and begging for      help. His tremors were not from cold. He was shaking from      withdrawal. Beads of sweat trickled down his forehead and      soaked his shirt. His body was unable to handle the side      effects of withdrawal. He was a heroin addict. This homeless      man with torn clothing, could not access a treatment center.      His last-ditch effort was to sit on the steps of a church and      pray, scream, for a miracle.       A miracle is ``a highly improbable or extraordinary event,      development, or accomplishment that brings very welcome      consequences.'' Miracles are meant for things we cannot      control, not things we can control like making help available      for drug addicts.       By funding public drug rehabilitation centers, we can help      drug addicts to recover from their addictions. No addicts can      do it alone and adequate support is the only way to help with      these problems.       An analysis from Blue Cross Blue Shield found that from      2010 to 2016, the number of people diagnosed with an      addiction to opioids climbed 493 percent. Yet, at the same      time, there was only a 65 percent increase in the number of      people getting medication-assisted treatment to manage their      addiction.       Why do we allow the drug abuse problem to skyrocket well      beyond treatment resources? Perhaps it is because drug      treatment centers come at a cost. They can range from      $20,000-$60,000 for a 30-90 day inpatient stay. No wonder      77.7 percent of addicts cannot afford it. But for society,      the costs go well beyond treatment.       The opioid crisis in America is increasing by the day and      with it comes increased deaths and suffering. Some suggest      creating injection sites to supervise heroin users to help      with the growing death toll. But this is a short term fix.      Rehab is a long-term fix and gives opioid abusers a chance to      reclaim normal lives.       Making rehabilitation centers more accessible to      financially strapped addicts will help the opioid epidemic.      Reducing or eliminating the financial blockades to treatment      that exist for nearly 80 percent of addicts will answer the      prayers of an increasing number of victims of this plague.      Affordable rehabilitation centers will eliminate the need for      miracles.        ella whitman, champlain valley union high school, junior       When my high school principal told us that there were only      three rules we had to follow I was shocked. How can you sum      up every expectation that must be demanded of a young adult      into three things? He went on to inform us that we must take      care of ourselves, take care of each other, and the place.      While thinking about these three guidelines it became      apparent that achieving them can be challenging at times but      the step to do it is simple; you must respect all things.      Looking at our Nation today it is clear that lack of respect      creates the most conflict in our Our negligence to      respect each other's bodies, opinions, ethnicities, races,      backgrounds and beliefs leads us to discrimination, hatred      and prejudice. We see endless examples in our lives today.       The lack of respect for one another's opinion is vividly      apparent in politics today. The Pew Research Center recently      reported how the partisan divide on our Nation's politics is      increasing. A study concluded, ``The shares of Republicans      and Democrats who express very unfavorable opinions of the      opposing party have increased dramatically since the 1990's,      but have changed little in recent years.'' This is alarming      because if we as people cannot see others perspective, we      will not be able to collaborate or work with one another to      collectively strengthen our By respecting others'      opinions we can gain insight and also learn their specific      needs.[[Page S650]]       Not only is respect lacking towards each other's opinions,      but to others wellbeing as we have recently seen millions of      women come forward with stories of sexual abuse. Not only in      our Nation's history but in present day, women are treated as      objects. Just within the last twenty four hours, additional      notable people have come forward with their previous stories      of harassment such as Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Lawrence      and Molly Ringwald, not to mention the 12 million others who      have also shared their own stories on       Looking back, maybe our principal had a point. To function      not only as a school, but as a community or even a nation we      must have respect. To advance our Nation from its biggest      struggles and alleviate the consequences that come with it,      each person must learn how to see out of another's eyes. Each      person must treat one another with dignity. Respect is      important to our country because it allows us to adjoin      together as one. Our Nation was created upon respect and      embracing one another for their differences. Each person's      difference allows us to be the unique nation we are today. We      must embrace and respect every opinion that each one of us      has, every talent each one of us possesses and every person      each one of us is.     name withheld upon request, burlington school district, senior       The biggest issue we face in America today is that we      neglect our incarcerated population. I'm part of the juvenile      incarcerated population, and as a resident I don't feel like      I'm getting the appropriate treatment I need. I was already      here once and the skills I learned were not enough to keep me      from coming back.       Incarcerated people need to be given the opportunity and      resources to identify what gets them in trouble and to work      on their problems. If a person has a history of violent      behaviors and is incarcerated because of his behaviors, he      shouldn't be doing groups on drugs and alcohol. Instead he      should be focusing his time and attention on working to      better his violent behaviors so he can be successful when he      gets out.       Another issue is that there are many young people in the      system who do not need to be. There are almost 7,000 youth      behind bars for ``technical violations'' of their probation.      Also, about 600 youth are behind bars for ``status offense,''      which are behaviors that are not law violations for adults,      such as running away, truancy, and incorrigibility.       There are another 840,000 people on parole and about 3.7      million people on probation. I would like to see better      support for these people who come out of jail. If previously      incarcerated people relapse for certain types of offenses      like drug and alcohol offenses, breaking curfew, or violating      probation, they should be given opportunities to fix that      before it becomes a pattern, rather than being thrown back in      jail.       I also think they should have more adult programs like      juveniles have such as short or longterm programs away from      their environment. A placement that juveniles go to after      being released from a locked facility is called a step down.      Laraway is an example of this, where a juvenile can go and be      allowed back in the community. They are given the opportunity      and supports to help them find a job and enroll back in      school.       I hope that policymakers and the public carefully consider      better treatment within locked facilities and alternatives to      incarceration for people who are not a threat to public      safety. We should ask whether legitimate social goals are      served by maintaining the status quo.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS648.txt,1010,CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995 REFORM ACT,2018.0,6.0,February

466,topic-id,1292,"Mr.President, it is no secret that our country faces a major healthcare crisis and, in fact, a dysfunctional healthcare system.  We have some 30 million people who have no health insurance, and that number is going to go up in the coming year. We have even more people who are underinsured, with high deductibles and copayments. Our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, which means that millions of people who go to the doctor to get a prescription are simply unable to afford the bill. In fact, the description of that is the definition of a dysfunctional, failing healthcare system.  In the midst of all of that, there is another particular crisis dealing with primary healthcare, and that is that even when people do have health insurance in many parts of our country, they are finding it very hard to go to a doctor and to get in to a doctor to treat the ailments that they have. We fall behind many other countries in terms of our lack of emphasis on primary healthcare, which should be the heart and soul of any strong healthcare system. The bottom line is that when you get sick, you should be able to get to the doctor when you need to and not have to wait weeks and months in order to do so.  In the midst of a failing primary healthcare system, there is one very strong bright spot, and that is that for many decades now, in every State in this country, we have had community health centers run by the people themselves--democratically run--addressing the healthcare needs of those given communities. Today, in America, we have about 27 million people--27 million men, women, and children--who are accessing community health centers. In my own State of Vermont, one out of four Vermonters gets their primary healthcare through a community health center.  These centers do more than provide primary healthcare. They also provide dental care, an issue that is too often ignored when we talk about the healthcare crisis. They provide mental health counseling, which is more important now than perhaps it has ever been because of the opioid and heroin epidemic our country is experiencing. Equally important, they provide low-cost prescription drugs at a time when so many Americans cannot afford the medicines they need. That is what community health centers do, and they[[Page S629]]do it well, and they do it cost effectively.  To my mind, there is no question but that there is strong bipartisan support here in the Senate and in the House for community health centers. Yet now we have gone over 4 months into the 2018 fiscal year, and we still have not reauthorized funding for community health centers. Frankly, I do not understand how it happens that when we have strong bipartisan support in the House and the Senate for programs that are working extremely well in every State in this country, the Republican leadership still has not reauthorized the community health center program. There is good bipartisan legislation right here in the Senate that has, I think, the support of virtually everybody in the Democratic caucus. Seven or eight Republicans are supporting it. It is the Blunt-Stabenow bill. It is a 5-year extension of community health centers reauthorization with a modest increase in the budget. If that bill came to the floor today, my guess is that it would get 70, 80 votes--maybe even more. We have gone 4 months into the fiscal year, and we still have not seen that bill reauthorized.  What is happening all over this country is that community health centers, which often struggle with recruitment and retention, are finding it harder than ever to retain the doctors, nurses, and other medical staff they need because applicants are looking around and saying: Why should I work at a community health center if I don't even know if it is going to be there next year? Why should I stay at a community health center if I can get a better job offer and I don't know if this community health center will be funded?  As a result of 4 months of inaction, community health centers all over this country are hurting. I say enough is enough. Right now, as soon as possible, we need to reauthorize the community health center program for at least 5 years, and we need to make sure there is adequate funding so that they can continue to do the excellent work they are doing all over this country.                            Opioid Epidemic  Mr.President, there is another issue that I would like to briefly touch upon. There has been a lot of discussion--appropriately so--about the opioid epidemic that is sweeping the United We have lost some 63,000 Americans as a result of opioid overdoses in 2016 alone. Families by the millions are being impacted.  I was in Brattleboro, VT, a few weeks ago, and they talked to me about what is happening to the children whose parents are addicted to opioids. They need to find foster homes for those children.  This is clearly an epidemic that has to be dealt with. We have to increase funding for prevention to make sure young people don't get swept up into the epidemic and also for treatment for those people who are addicted.  There is an issue that we have not touched upon enough, and that is holding the drug companies responsible and accountable for the products they brought into the market. As some people may recall, in April of 1994, the CEOs of the seven largest tobacco companies testified before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment in a historic hearing. What that hearing was about was, under oath, demanding to know what the executives from the tobacco industry knew and when they knew it. Did they know that their product was addictive? Did they know that tobacco caused cancer, heart disease, and other medical problems? They were asked to hold their hands up and under oath tell the committee what they knew.  I think it is now appropriate for the Senate to do the same with those drug companies that are producing opioids. I think we need to know what the drug companies knew in terms of the addictive qualities of those drugs. There is some evidence out there that suggests that drug companies, in fact, did know that the product they were selling was in fact addictive, but they forgot to tell the doctors--and certainly not the patients.  It is one thing for somebody to do something in ignorance, not knowing the impact of what you produce. That happens all the time. It is something very different if, in fact, the manufacturer of a product understands that the product causes addiction, that the product causes death. We need to get to the root of that issue. We need to know what the drug companies knew and when they knew that.  I would hope very much that in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over this issue, we could bring the executives of those drug companies that produce these opioids before us, because not only are we talking about 60,000 people a year dying as a result of overdoses, but what we are talking about also is the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars in healthcare and law enforcement associated with opioid addiction.  I hope that we can move forward and have those executives come before us and tell us under oath what they knew and when they knew it, because I think the time is long overdue for us to hold them accountable.  With that, I yield the floor.

628,topic-id,4449,"Mr.President, last week I entered into the Record the winning essays in my office's eighth annual State of the Union Essay I would like to congratulate the other finalists in this year's contest and likewise ask that their essays be printed in the The essays follow, in alphabetical order according to the finalists' names.  The material follows:       BAILEY BLOW, SOUTH BURLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR, FINALIST       At the beginning of December, a video of a polar bear was      posted on Twitter by ``National Geographic.'' When people      think of polar bears, they imagine snow and ice; however, in      this video, snow and ice were nowhere to be found. There was      only green. Polar bears are also known for their massive      size. The polar bear from the video did not look massive or      strong. This poor bear was weak and dangerously skinny. It      could barely walk. Without snow and ice, there wasn't a food      source for the bear to eat. The scientists that captured the      video believed that[[Page S606]]     it would be dead within hours if it didn't find food to eat.       When I came across this video, I was heartbroken. It was      hard to watch and I found myself struggling to finish it.      Watching this animal suffer and barely able to move in a      habitat that should be covered in ice opened my eyes more. It      was a hard sight to see, but this video is important for      everyone to see. This polar bear is what climate change looks      like. Climate change is not just something that effects      animals and their habitats, it's something that affects all      of us around the world.       In the recent years, our Nation and the rest of the world      have seen an increase in natural disasters, warmer      temperatures, a more acidic ocean, and a greater amount of      greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Climate change is not      something that we can just ignore anymore. If we keep moving      in the direction we are going, we will no longer have a      healthy planet to live on. Time has not run out yet and there      is still hope. If we begin to move towards healing our planet      now, we can begin to reverse climate change.       One of the first steps we should take towards addressing      climate change is getting back into the Paris It      was very concerning to most of the Nation when President      Trump decided to pull the United States out of this      agreement. This decision was concerning because it gives the      impression to the rest of the world that the U.doesn't      believe that climate change is a big deal. Scientists have      proven time and time again that climate change is real and it      is happening. By getting back into this agreement, the U.     can continue to contribute to the fight against climate      change.       Another step that could be taken is more environmental      laws. These laws could cover a wide range of things, such as      using alternative energy to cut back on greenhouse gases in      the atmosphere or preventing landfill from getting into the      ocean. Our priority should be protecting the planet that      gives us a home.       Climate change is more apparent now than it has ever been      before. It is the most pressing issue facing not only our      country, but the entire world. Something needs to be done      about it before our only home is destroyed.          MASON CASTLE, JOHNSBURY ACADEMY JUNIOR, FINALIST       The United States was founded as a democratic republic in      1776. The implication of this system of government is that it      is one controlled by the American people through their      representatives. The Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments were      even added following progressive social movements whose aims      were ensuring that democracy was for all Americans and not      just for a fraction of our people. However, recent      Congressional elections have shed light on the threat of      gerrymandering to democracy. While race-based gerrymandering      was declared illegal by the Voting Rights Act of 1965,      partisan gerrymandering is technically legal. However, it      deprives millions of Americans of their full representation,      and results in a system where politicians choose their      voters, rather than voters electing their representatives.      Gerrymandering runs counter to the fundamental values of a      democratic republic, and therefore to American values, so it      must be addressed if we are to ``secure the blessings of      liberty for ourselves and our posterity,'' as the preamble to      the Constitution says.       Gerrymandering occurs when a state legislature draws      district lines so that they favor a certain party through      ``packing and cracking.'' This is when votes are either      condensed into a singular district so surplus victory votes      are wasted, or broken up into other districts so that they      are smothered by opposing votes. What results is that the      influence of packed or cracked votes become less significant      in determining the results of an election. This becomes      especially problematic when the victors of gerrymandered      elections gain a majority of seats during Census years      because they decide where to draw district lines. This leads      to one party holding an overwhelming majority that isn't      necessarily representative of the American people. While this      is a less overt method of voter suppression, it has proven to      be far more effective.       In response to this issue, I propose that rather than      having politicians draw districts, we use a neutral algorithm      that draws fair districts that represent real American      communities. This algorithm would eliminate the factor of      human bias, and draw the most efficient maps possible.       Wendy Tam Cho, a professor of political science at the      University of Illinois designed such an algorithm in response      to the Supreme Court case Gill v. Whitford, in which      Wisconsin lawmakers' proposed map eliminated any possibility      of opponent victories. This violated the ``one person, one      vote'' principle that came out of Baker v. Carr in 1962. So      to create a map that would uphold this principle, Tam Cho      used the University's supercomputers to draw billions of      potential districts. The maps that were decided to be      fairest, were the ones with the lowest efficiency gap or      ``packing and cracking.'' Using these third party algorithms,      States can effectively make sure that every American has a      say in politics, and uphold the democratic values this      country was founded on.      LILLIAN CAZAYOUX, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR       There is no doubt in my mind that the biggest problem in      the country, as well as in Vermont, is the opioid epidemic.      No matter where you go, it's impossible to find any community      that has not been affected by scourge of these drugs. Whether      it's an addiction to prescription painkillers, or dangerous      street drugs like heroin, we need to dedicate greater      resources to fighting them.       Opioid death tolls have been on the rise over the past two      decades and began to accelerate rapidly in 2011. Opioid      overdose deaths nearly doubled over the last five years,      surpassing 42,200 nationwide in 2016. In Vermont the death      toll was 100. Opioids don't care where you come from, nor do      they discriminate based on socioeconomic status. Twenty of      the deaths in Vermont occurred with people who had no high      school diploma, however, an equal number occurred with people      who had a college degree. No matter who you are, you are just      as susceptible to opioid addiction. It's time as Vermonters,      as Americans, as citizens who care for one another, that we      take a stand.       There are two aspects to this problem that must be      addressed and fixed; keeping addicts alive, as well as      preventing more people from becoming addicted.       The big dangers with these drugs are how easy it is to      overdose on them, and the diseases contracted by injecting      with unsterile needles. The first thing we must do is      preserve the lives at risk, by preventing fatal overdoses. I      believe the best solution to that would be to open supervised      injection sites. Popular in Europe, supervised injection      sites allow addicts to use drugs with sanitary materials,      provide treatment consultation, as well as medical help in      the case of an overdose emergency. With newer, more potent      drugs on the market such as fentanyl, it's crucial we find a      quick way to save these lives before thousands more are lost.      These supervised injection sites would provide a chance to      preserve lives until users can make the decision to begin the      rehabilitation process. The main goal of implementing these      sites would be to reduce the immediate health issues that      opioid addiction presents, as well as attempting to refer the      addicts into treatment.       The other preemptive part of this plan would be targeting      doctors that over-prescribe highly addictive opioids in      unnecessary cases. I believe more stringent rules regulating      these prescriptions could prevent many people from becoming      addicted to these medicines in the first place, before they      turn to the cheaper more dangerous cousin, heroin.       Attacking the epidemic from both sides of the problem could      be the solution to saving lives from opioid addictions.              VIJAYATA DAHAL, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR       I was eight years old when I immigrated to the United      States with my family from Bhutan and With us, we      brought hope. Hope for better economic opportunities, better      education, and a brighter future. Most importantly, we hoped      for a country to call home.       Immigrants built America and it thrives because of them.      The opportunity to migrate to the United States should be      open to everyone despite their race, religion, and the color      of their skin. Today, the President wants to stop      immigration, deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, and      eliminate the program that protects the children of illegal      immigrants. Like my parents, millions of immigrants have      migrated to the United States for centuries. Some come to      flee violence. Some want religious freedom. Some come to      escape poverty. Some come to have a home.       According to Michael Shear of the New York Times, the      president banned people from seven predominantly Muslim      countries to protect the United States from terror attacks.      Ironically, non-Muslims commit more terrorist attacks in the      United According to Ruiz-Grossman's article in the      Huffington Post, white supremacists, militias, and sovereign      citizens carried out 115 cases of terrorist attacks on the      U.soil; Islamist extremists executed 63 terrorist attacks.      The President should use his power to find a solution to stop      the white supremacists rather than banning thousands of      innocent human beings who are in search of a home.       In the United States, there are approximately 11.3 million      illegal immigrants, many of whom brought their children      along. According to Jennah Moon of The New Yorker, almost      800,000 undocumented immigrants came to the U.as children.      These children are protected by a federal program--known as      Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA allows      the Dreamers the right to live, study, and work in the United            In September 2017, the Trump administration announced plans      to eliminate DACA and gave Congress six months to come up      with a legislative solution. The new development has put the      Dreamers at risk. Thousands of Dreamers have worked hard to      attend schools, serve the government, and establish their      careers. If Congress doesn't pass legislation, innocent      children and young adults will be deported.       The U.should make background checks more efficient.      America should not deport the 11 million undocumented      immigrants. Instead, they should get the right to become      citizens of the United States so that they receive the same      opportunities as legal immigrants. Finally, Congress should      create a plan that allows the Dreamers to work, study, and      live in the United States and become citizens.[[Page S607]]       Immigration makes America unique. Our Nation was built and      run by immigrants. Even the ones who are born here are all      descendants of immigrants who came here fleeing poverty and      violence, in search of a brighter future. The doors of      America were open then, and they should stay open now to      welcome the ``tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe      free.''       PAIGE GREENIA, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR       How do people attain the goods that they want when the      government makes them illegal? They turn to the black market.      Now more than ever the United States is seeing a push to take      certain goods out of the black market system. Right now, the      major topic on the federal level is marijuana. Currently,      several States have completely legalized the sale and use of      marijuana, and several others are in the middle of making      their decision. It would be in the best interest of the whole      country to move toward legalizing and decriminalizing      marijuana.       Actions towards decriminalizing and legalizing marijuana      would make the marijuana trade, something that people that      are going to do no matter if it's legal or not, much safer.      The first way is that the government could set regulations on      the growing and production of the substance. The government      could establish a few trustworthy growers across the country      to grow the marijuana to governmental safety standards and      make sure that consumers don't have to worry about their      products being laced with harmful substances. According to      the American Addiction Centers, marijuana can be laced with      dangerous substances such as lead, glass, heroin, PCP,      laundry detergent and cocaine. In addition, if the Federal      and State governments worked towards making marijuana a non-     black market trade, officials would see countless less drug      deal-related deaths and injuries. This is significant because      according to Bill Conroy of ``The Narcosphere'', ``the number      of people murdered in the drug war inside the United States      between 2006 and 2010 exceeds the U.troop death toll in      the Iraq War.'' If marijuana isn't part of the black market,      there cannot be drug dealers who are willing to do anything      possible to get their money. If users don't have to be      secretive about their use, they will be less likely to be      hostile and more likely to get help and the amount of drug      incidents will decrease. If the government officials take      marijuana off the black market, it will make communities      safer.       In the interest of saving the government money, the      decriminalization and legalization of marijuana can      contribute majorly. If the government legalizes marijuana,      they can alleviate the cost of making arrests related to      marijuana use. After all, ``authorities spend more than $3.6      billion enforcing laws against marijuana possession''      according to a frequently cited report by the American Civil      Liberties Fifty-two percent of all arrests made in      2010 were due to marijuana related incidents, and a      staggering 700,000 marijuana arrests were made in 2014. As a      baseline statistic, the average cost to keep an inmate in a      New York state prison is around $60,000 per inmate annually.      All the money saved by the State and Federal governments      could be more appropriately be dedicated to lessening the      country's increasing national debt.       For these reasons, the decriminalization and legalization      of marijuana for recreational use, removing it from the black      market, would benefit not only our state, but the entire      country.             KAITLINN LITTLE, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR       I am afraid to walk down the street. I cannot afford to      spend mental energy on how I present myself in order to      remain sexually safe. Instead, I focus on leaving a positive      and impactful mark on this world. From a young age, my sex      wasn't an obstacle in anything I did. I played with pink and      blue toys. Stranger danger applied to all children. I played      in the mud with a dress on. Then, I wanted to look like      I wanted to be rescued by a prince instead of saving      myself. Children on the playground told me when a boy was      mean, it meant he had a crush. Slowly but surely, we fell      into the roles we were taught to follow. Today, women are      coming forward and insisting that sexism is still an issue      and I find that from the shallow strides I take in the      presence of a man, this reality is with me, too.       According to ``Psychology Today'', 56% of women in the      United States are dissatisfied with their appearance. I've      seen that young and old women will change their looks or even      who they are so that a man will accept and notice them.      Carolyn Coker Ross, MD says that how media portrays female      bodies influences how women see themselves. She writes about      the physical alterations women started performing during the      1800's. Women have put themselves in danger through plastic      surgery to be ``beautiful.'' Such behavior should not be      socially acceptable. Biologically, humans look for traits in      a mate that they consider attractive. We were not built to      harm ourselves to reach that appearance.       Gender roles in the past assigned women to be meek.      Although the roles aren't as black and white today, those      mentalities are still common throughout media. People in      power make it difficult to move forward. Planned Parenthood      explains that gender roles can occur in different forms such      as personality traits, domestic behaviors, occupation, and      physical appearances. But there are also ways to fight back,      such as pointing out stereotyping in media to help people      become aware of it. Speaking out about roles that could hurt      us will draw attention to the issue. Speaking up for victims      of sexism will spread awareness. And finally, not strictly      following traditional norms will open people's minds. No      drastic measures need to be made in order to prove a point.      Simply being yourself, no matter how you act, dress, or look,      should be the American norm.       My existence is not to be blanketed by fear but to thrive      as a woman who is beneficial to a world that is hurting. If      we are silent, power remains in the hands of those who impose      silence on us. Listening to the people who witness hate with      their own eyes surely will bring some relief to American      women who are afraid to stride with the confidence and      strength they are meant to have.     DUNCAN MCGRADE, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE       Today, the United States faces its greatest threat since      the Cold It does not have a flag, or an ideology. It is      unarmed, but deadly. It is the critical issue of our times.      The greatest challenge America faces today comes from climate      change and the unwillingness to act to stop it. The 2017      Atlantic hurricane season broke records with 17 storms,      hundreds of direct fatalities, and $292,000,000,000 in      damages. It was the first such hurricane season, but it will      not be the last. Scientists are still assessing the      unprecedented hurricane season of last year, but the Union of      Concerned Scientists has made clear that new, unnatural      climatic conditions have worsened natural disasters, and will      continue to do so. With millions of people living near the      Caribbean and the eastern seaboard, including in U.states      and territories, inaction is unacceptable. Funding must be      provided to create, improve, or maintain storm resistant      infrastructure and housing, and to treat the cause: climate      change.       New climate threats are not only impacting the East Coast--     far from it. The West Coast has been plagued with yet another      series of un-natural disasters: wildfires. Wildfires are      short but destroy lives nonetheless. In the past year alone,      thousands have been displaced, and 46 people have been      killed. Experts fear this is merely a harbinger of far worse      wildfire seasons to come, and the mass damage, casualties,      and displacement that they will bring.       Climate change displacement is not only an American      problem, but a global one. Today, 21.5 million people have      been forcibly displaced due to directly climate-related      events, according to the Many of these refugees have      fled to developed states, which have largely failed in their      humanitarian obligations. Developed states must do better      because millions more climate refugees are expected in the      coming years. Directly climate related catastrophes are not      the only force behind the greatest refugee crisis since the      Second World Outright resource conflict has reared its      head, with resource scarcity and inequality an amplifier of      other conflicts that directly impact U.interests, such as      the disruption of merchant shipping in vital maritime      chokepoints due to piracy, a behavior fundamentally driven by      poverty. For pragmatic and moral reasons, the U.must      address poverty at home and overseas. One way to manage this      issue is at the source, by halting climate induced scarcity      of resources.       Today, the United States faces a critical threat: climate      change. The death and destruction caused by climate change is      no longer a hypothetical. It is a current and critical threat      to the security of the people of the United States and the      globe, today and tomorrow. Climate change has already caused      catastrophic environmental and humanitarian crises. The      United States must halt climate change by subsidizing the      blossoming green energy movement, aiding worker transition to      renewable energy careers, correcting an anti-science culture,      and re-entering the Paris Climate Accord immediately. We must      act now because America's lethargy of today is humanity's      calamity of tomorrow.                JAKE MCNEIL, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR       Vermont is a unique State that is comprised of small,      tight-knit communities; these communities have a close      relationship with local government. Teachers, a vital      component to both the community and in promoting students to      be forward-thinkers, help shape Vermont into the innovative      and creative state that it is. Lately, however, there has      been a lack of consideration in regards to the teachers who      are at the heart of Vermont's schools and communities.      Scattered across our Facebook feeds and blasted from our car      radios are stories of local school districts' strife. For      decades, teacher strikes have become commonplace, each with a      lasting impact on the Vermont education system. The Vermont-     National Education Association, VT-NEA, has recorded over 26      strikes in the state. However, this issue is not just      relevant to Vermont, but every State across the country.      Teachers are a fundamental part of our school systems and are      influential in the development of future generations, which      is why I believe it is essential that attention is paid to      the underlying issues that spark these strikes. From      underfunded schools and issues with employee contracts to      unsatisfactory working conditions and hefty workloads, the      laundry list of problems is anything but miniscule. We must      do two things: open the door to productive communication by      letting teachers[[Page S608]]     air their grievances, and have school boards focus more      resources on trying to resolve those issues. This will help      teachers attain and deliver the curricula they desire by      coordinating cost saving measures, all without breaking the      town budgets. The students of America, our future generation,      deserve an education without interruption.       We need to have teachers and leadership communicate      constantly to get the schools and outcomes we desire. By      engaging in productive, civil and persistent dialogue between      all parties, teachers serve as models in promoting the      behaviors they want to instill in their students, like      myself, and the community: standing up against injustice,      making difficult decisions, and insisting on being treated      with dignity and respect--despite such actions being      perceived as very difficult and unpopular. In essence,      continual dialogue among all parties is a more productive,      and instructive, model for our teachers and leadership to      follow. The process of continual dialogue will help all      parties involved identify areas in the system that need      funding by communicating and pinpointing the specific areas      of interest: materials, professional development, and teacher      contracts. This allows leadership to make informed choices      about budgeting, which is a more effective use of limited      funds.       Education is an essential service, and as such we must      strive to make it better. As President John Kennedy said,      ``The race between education and erosion, between wisdom and      waste has not run its course.'' We are still in the race, and      by having teachers, state, and national leadership continue      to work together, we can place ourselves in the best position      to win the race. As Americans, it is critical for citizens to      support the educators that shape our communities into the      melting pot of growth and creativity that they are today.         LILY MINER, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR       During this first year of the Donald Trump presidency, we      have witnessed many questionable decisions being made for our      country that not only affect us, but also those around the      world in a negative way. One particular decision, however,      has set our country on a path to continue the horrific damage      being done to President Trump's adjudication to pull      out of the Paris Climate Agreement has left us as the only      nation in the world to oppose it since Syria signed to join      in The main objective for this agreement was to      restrict levels of CO2 emissions from each country. The      consequences of Trump's withdrawal are grave, as CO2 levels      in the atmosphere have risen past 400 parts per million--     levels that are already superseding what Earth can handle to      support the flora and fauna living on it. Continuing this      trend will most likely result in a mass extinction event.       Hearing the White House argue that removing us from the      agreement will help boost our economy filled much of the      American public as well as climate experts around the globe      with a sense of outrage. We have already accumulated a      surplus of evidence that manmade climate change is having a      drastic negative impact. In the past two decades, sea levels      have risen at a rate of .13 inches, which is twice the rate      of the past century. From 1992 to 2011, Greenland lost 152      billion tons of ice per year, West Antarctica lost 65 billion      per year, and the Antarctic Peninsula lost 20 billion per      year. Increased intensity in extreme weather including      hurricanes, floods, and snowstorms has been recorded since      the 1950's. These are just a fraction of the plethora of      examples. Given the massive amount of damage that has already      been done, how can it be justified to place the economy as a      higher priority?       This choice is especially irresponsible when considering      the fact that the United States produces more excess CO2 than      any other country. While there are many factors to blame, one      of the largest and least necessary of these is the use of      fossil fuels. They provide 81% of the energy in the United      States, yet they are both incredibly harmful and incredibly      easy to replace. A change needs to be made.       It is imperative that we as a global superpower begin to      invest in renewable energy such as wind and solar. Many      economists agree that the long term benefits from switching      to renewable energy would outweigh the short term costs,      improving the economy through more environmentally sound      means. Certainly a more competent course of action than      removing ourselves from the Paris Though the cost      of installation for these methods are pricier than more      conventional ones, they have no fuel costs once they are      functioning and the maintenance costs are cheaper. The United      States has not only the resources, but the duty to fight      against these issues. We need to combat this now, because we      will not be given a second chance later.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-05-pt1-PgS605-2.txt,1010,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 772, COMMON SENSE NUTRITION",2018.0,5.0,February
540,topic-id,881,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to H.772.  This bill is completely unnecessary, overly prescriptive, and would deny consumers critical information about the food that they eat.  At a time when our country is facing an obesity epidemic--I would say, really, crisis--we should not be undermining efforts to educate consumers about the nutritional value of foods, including calories.  As a country, we pay a high price for obesity. It is estimated that medical costs for obesity top $190.2 billion, annually. Childhood obesity alone is responsible for $14 billion in direct medical costs. We should be embracing efforts to reduce this enormous cost to our healthcare system. A Harvard study found restaurant menu labeling could prevent up to 41,000 cases of childhood obesity and could save over $4.6 billion in healthcare costs over 10 years.  So if you want to eat pizza and fries, that is great, but why not have the opportunity to know how many calories are in that pizza and fries? You should be able to have that information. More information for consumers is a good thing.  The menu labeling law that passed in 2010 requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to provide consumers with basic nutritional information like calorie content for standard food and beverage items on menus. Since then, the FDA has been working to implement this rule only to face numerous delays along the way.  Research has shown that calorie information can help people make healthier choices, and 80 percent of Americans support providing this type of calorie information on the menu. But far from common sense, the legislation we are considering today would undermine the law. H.772 takes us backwards by undermining the law and further delaying consumer protections.  This is not about flexibility. This bill just gives cover to bad actors and special interests that do not want to comply with the law.  First, it would allow food establishments to display calorie information in ways that would only serve to confuse and mislead customers. It allows the food establishment to set arbitrary serving sizes and cut the calorie count way below what a normal person would eat. Without standardized calorie reporting for menu items, people will have a tough time figuring out and computing nutrition information and comparing across items. It is deceptive to label an entree or a muffin as multiple servings because we all know that they are mostly consumed by one person in one sitting.  Second, it would deny consumers the opportunity to view calorie information and other nutritional information regardless of how or where they purchase food from a chain restaurant. Not only does it allow deceptive serving size manipulation, this bill would allow food establishments to make that information difficult to find. Calorie labeling is not useful if it is posted somewhere that it will not be seen.  Provisions in this bill would deny customers nutritional information from not only inside a pizza chain, but inside fast-food and other chain restaurants if the majority of their orders are placed offsite, like on the telephone or online.  For example, under this bill, a restaurant or similar retail food establishment could have the option to only list nutritional information online or via some other remote-access menu, thereby denying consumers who order in a brick-and-mortar location access to the information. Speed limits are not useful if they are hidden on a highway, and calorie counts cannot help if they are concealed from the public.  Finally, it has been nearly 8 years since the original menu labeling requirements were passed, but this bill would once again delay the final menu labeling rules and send the FDA back[[Page H817]]to the drawing board. The FDA has already put forth a proposed rule, solicited comments, and worked with stakeholders to finalize the menu labeling rule.  In fact, just this past November, FDA published new draft guidance intended to help answer any of the outstanding questions regarding compliance. This guidance included sample menus and pictures to help food establishments tackle how to label for a variety of ingredients like multiple pizza toppings.  This rule has been delayed long enough. The final menu labeling regulations should go into effect as scheduled in May of this year. Countless businesses, restaurants, and other retail food establishments have already invested time and money into compliance with the current menu labeling rules, and it would be irresponsible to further delay implementation of this important rule.  This bill is another handout to businesses and an affront to consumers. It will keep consumers in the dark about the nutritional information that they need and create consumer and industry confusion.  H.772 would weaken an important tool intended to help Americans make informed food choices at a time when obesity and other nutrition-related health problems are at crisis levels. That is why countless consumer and public health organizations oppose this bill, including the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Nurses Association, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Consumers Union, and the Trust for America's All of these health organizations oppose this legislation because it is not good for the health of our country or for consumers.

This is an example that the FDA gave to businesses on how they could easily--we see all kinds of signs like this. Sometimes it is the price at the end of the item, and, in this case, it would be the calories.  So it talks about a slice of pizza. Now, I am feeling kind of chunky today, and I go into the pizza parlor, and it says that for cheese pizza, for th original, it is about 200 to 240 calories; for the thin and crispy, 150 to 190 calories; and for pan--now, we love our pan pizza, our deep-dish pizza in Chicago, but that is 260 to 300 calories.  So I am thinking: Yeah, I want pizza, but I think I am going to go with the thin and crispy, which is going to save me at least 110 calories.  Now, what do I want on top? I am looking now at all the things, the meats and the veggies that can go on top, and each one of them has calories per slice listed there. I am a pretty good--you know, I can do math pretty well, and I can also compare. Do I want something that is up to 50 calories or something that is 20 calories? And I can look at this sign and make a decision for myself.  This is not too cumbersome. This is something that could easily be displayed. I go to a lot of restaurants that already are in compliance and have the calories, and if I am like between the pasta and the salmon--and, again, I want to make that decision. It is good for me to know what is the real difference in calories.  I want to say, I started out as an activist in the grocery store. I was a very, very young housewife many years ago, 1970, when a small group of women got together. We called ourselves National Consumers United because we wanted to know how old our food was in the grocery store.  Everything was code dated. You couldn't tell how old the food was, and we were actually told that if we didn't like it, we could shop somewhere else. Well, we started cracking the codes like detectives, pushing the stock boys--and they were all boys--against the shelf, and they were telling us how they put the old stuff in front and the new stuff in the back.  Finally, we were able to get one of our retailers to say: Come to Jewel; our food has freshness dates. And people loved it. And it turned out that, even over the initial opposition from the retailers, it was good for them, because people appreciated that and went to their stores.  Now, those dates on food are ubiquitous. Customers like it, retailers like it, it is better, and this would be yet another thing that we could do.

The FDA went on to explain that minor violations would include inadvertently missing a calorie declaration for a standard menu item on the buffet; minor discrepancies in the type, size, color, contrast of calorie declarations; minimal variations or inadvertent error that would only minimally impact the calorie declaration, such as adding extra slices of pepperoni or an extra dollop of ketchup.

12,topic-id,324,"Mr.President, here is just a brief note on taxes in answer to what my friend the Republican leader has said. The reason that 48 Democrats voted against the bill and the reason that at this point, despite huge amounts of ads paid for by the wealthiest of Americans, the bill is still unpopular with the American people is very simple: The vast majority of the breaks go to the very wealthy and to big, powerful corporations and their lobbyists. That is who wins on this bill more than anybody else.  If a bill focused on the middle class gave 80 percent of the breaks to the middle class, there would be loads of Democrats voting for it. We are happy that there are a lot of wealthy people in God bless them. They don't need the huge tax break--the disproportionate tax break that our Republican friends gave them. That is why the bill is unpopular.  Again, people like the Koch brothers and the thousand very, very wealthy--many of them so greedy--billionaires who don't want to pay any taxes put all of these ads on TV and have a whole propaganda machine. They still can't convince the American people.  Our Republican colleagues are afraid to talk about what they really mean in the tax bill--trickle-down economics. When they talk among themselves, they say: Give the wealthy a lot of money, give the big corporations a lot of money, and everyone will do fine. They don't have an honest debate on this because they are afraid to say it. So they act like they aim most of this at the middle class.  The only way this is aimed at the middle class is trickle down: Give the money disproportionately to the wealthy and the big corporations, and the middle class will benefit. We don't believe that.

97,topic-id,588,"Mr.President, as we continue discussions about another extension of government funding, Senate negotiators are working on a deal to lift the spending caps for both defense and urgent domestic priorities.  From the very beginning of the budget debate, Democrats have made our position in these negotiations very clear. We support an increase in funding for our military and our middle class. The two are not mutually exclusive. We don't want to do just one and leave the other behind. The sequester caps have arbitrarily imposed austerity on both sides of the ledger, defense and the nondefense programs that benefit middle-class people, such as education, infrastructure, and medical research. The caps have hamstrung the Pentagon's ability to make reliable investments, no doubt, but they have also cut support harshly and unintelligently from middle-class programs.  We ought to get out from sequestration entirely because our men and women in uniform deserve the resources they need to keep our country safe--as do our veterans waiting for better healthcare; as do young men and women, many of them veterans, seeking treatment for opioid addiction; as do rural families waiting for high-speed internet to connect themselves and their kids to the world; as do hard-working pensioners who forewent salary increases and bonuses to secure a pension that is now evaporating before their very eyes.  That is why Democrats have pushed consistently to increase funding to fight the scourge of opioids, to improve veterans healthcare, to build rural infrastructure, to shore up pensions, and to deal with childcare. These are the kinds of things we are pushing for in addition to, not to the exclusion of, increasing defense.

I would like to express my appreciation to the Republican leader, in addition, for his invitation to address the McConnell Center next week in Louisville, which I have accepted.  As leaders, the two of us can work together to get things done around here, and the best opportunity to work together is the budget. It is an opportunity not just for us but for our country, not only to escape the terrible damage of sequestration but to condemn it to the past, and we should seize that opportunity.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS618-4.txt,1036,ECONOMIC JUSTICE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY,2018.0,6.0,February
100,topic-id,586,"Mr.President, now for a word on the Russia investigation, last night the House Intelligence Committee voted to release the contents of the Schiff memo. Now that the House Intelligence Committee has acted, President Trump should move--in conjunction with the DOJ and the FBI--and release the Schiff memo to the public. The American people deserve the chance to make their own judgment on the facts of this small piece of the broader case of Russia's interference in our election.  The President decided the public deserved to see the Nunes memo before he had even read it. So he ought to be just as eager for the American people to see this memo, which refutes--effectively, devastatingly--so much in the Nunes memo.  Given that the Schiff memo is based on the same underlying documents as the Republicans' partisan memo, there should be no question as to whether or not the President should approve its release. If he decides to keep the Democratic memo under wraps, the American people are going to be forced to wonder: What is the President trying to hide? What is he afraid of?  President Trump should release the Schiff memo--and quickly. It will illustrate what a sham the Nunes memo is. Then, we can all move on and, as some of my good Republican colleagues have had the courage to say--not enough, but some: Let Mueller do his investigation unimpeded, and let's see where the results end up.  We need to move on. The Nunes memo is only the latest in a long line of distractions manufactured by the most extreme elements of the Republican Party and the conservative media to distract from the special counsel's investigation. It started with conspiracies about ``deep state'' leaks and unmasking requests, phone taps at Trump Tower, and Uranium One, and now it is this memo. They don't quit with all these conspiracy theories, with all these ridiculous fomentations. They don't quit, perhaps because they are afraid of what a real investigation, which Mueller is doing and will continue to do, will reveal.  What the American people want to know are three simple things: One, what did the Russians do to interfere in our elections; two, were there Americans involved in helping the Russians; and three, what are we doing to prevent the Russians from interfering in 2018 and beyond? To that point, Americans should be much more concerned about this administration's tepid response to Putin's interference in our election than about a memo of Republican talking points.  Any other administration, any other President, I believe, would have made punishing Putin and protecting our democracy a primary issue in the first term, but this President began his first year in office by downplaying Putin's involvement in the 2016 election, and then he repeatedly accepted Putin's words of denial over the consensus of the American intelligence community.  When the administration tried to wiggle out of existing sanctions against Russia, Congress overwhelmingly and almost unanimously passed legislation strengthening the existing sanctions and adding new ones to address the interference. We are still waiting for President Trump to implement the new round of sanctions. What is he waiting for? Why does he refuse to get tough with Putin? We look to the President of the United States to stand up for our democracy against all threats, but unfortunately and sadly--bad for America--President Trump has abdicated this responsibility when it comes to  I yield the floor.

188,topic-id,766,"Mr.President, on Friday, the Trump administration declassified and released the contents of the deceptive Nunes memo. It is the latest distraction concocted by Republicans to protect the President of their party from the conclusions of a truly independent investigation. Shamefully, it is the latest abuse in a long line of partisan broadsides against the FBI, the Nation's premier law enforcement agency. These attacks erode faith in the rule of law.  At least the American people can now see the Nunes memo for what it truly is: an impotent document of GOP talking points. Far from being the smoking gun that many Republicans, rightwing media outlets, and Russia-linked bots claimed it would be, the Nunes memo just blows smoke. It is full of misleading conclusions based on innuendo.  What it does confirm does not vindicate the President or prove bias at the Department of It confirms that the Steele dossier was not the catalyst for the Russia investigation, debunking a favorite rightwing talking point. Let that sink in. The FBI was concerned about Trump campaign advisers linked to Putin's spy services before--let me repeat, before--the Steele dossier existed. This idea that the Steele dossier created all this is just plain wrong, and even their own memo admits it.  The Nunes memo also confirms that a three-judge panel, on multiple occasions, thought it was in the best interest of our national security to monitor a Trump campaign adviser for his troubling links with the  Seeing as House Republicans saw fit to release the contents of their partisan memo, they should certainly support the release of the memo prepared by Ranking Member If House Republicans had any semblance of fairness, they would vote to release the Schiff memo. It is based on the same underlying documents. If it was all right to release the Republican memo on these documents, it should be all right to release a Democratic memo based on the same documents.  Meanwhile, President Trump still refuses to implement the sanctions that passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in I have to say, if President Trump and his allies spent half the time standing up to Putin as they do attacking our own FBI, we might actually get somewhere with But the administration seems to fear doing anything to upset him. The American people ask: Why? Why is Donald Trump so afraid to upset Mr.Putin?  What are they so afraid of? It is inexplicable to me that the President of the United States and his allies are far more concerned with attacking American law enforcement agencies than standing up to President Putin interfered with our sacred democratic process. The very process we exalt--correctly so--in our schools and teach our children is so wonderful, Putin is trying to make a sham of. He is trying to interfere with it. We hardly hear a peep out of President Trump and so many Republicans on this side of the aisle who used to go after Putin, to their credit, regularly.  We have an investigation into the matter of Putin's engagement in our elections by one of the most trusted and nonpartisan civil servants in Washington, but because that investigation might include some wrongdoing by the President or his close associates, too many Republicans in Congress and, of course, the conservative media have turned on the FBI rather than on  It is far more than disquieting. It is the worst place that partisan politics can go. The vital interests of our Nation are being subverted to the benefit of a foreign hostile power. A Congressman says that we are witnessing a ``coup'' on the House floor. A Senator floats the possibility of ``secret societies.'' The Speaker of the House suggests a ``cleanse'' of the  For partisan reasons, the President and his allies in Congress are systematically trying to weaken America's faith in the rule of law, and to a large extent, sadly, the leaders of the Republican Party have been silent.

We desperately need more of our Republican friends to stand up and speak out, particularly the Republican leadership, because their silence is rapidly becoming complicit in the denigration of our Republic--something that is happening, unfortunately, before our very eyes.

Unfortunately, if continued, it will have a lasting impact on our security structures, on our democratic institutions, and on our people. Ultimately, it will help the Kremlin achieve its goal of breaking down our country and our democratic way of life.  In a report issued in January 2017, the U.intelligence community found that Russia interfered in our elections. This was the unanimous conclusion of all 17 U.intelligence agencies. Indeed, that Russian interference continues to this day, not only in the domestic affairs of the United States but in the affairs of our Western allies. We have seen the Kremlin's hand in Great Britain, in Spain, in France, and in Mexico--all in an effort to determine the outcome and to disrupt elections in those countries.  Just last week, in an interview with the BBC, CIA Director Mike Pompeo[[Page S641]]confirmed Russia's ongoing interference. As Senator Cardin said, when Director Pompeo was asked if Russia would try to influence our midterm elections this year, he replied: ``Of course. I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that.''  In fact, in recent weeks, Russian internet trolls and bots have used Facebook and Twitter to aggressively promote the release of the House Republicans' memo, by Devin Nunes, that attacks the integrity of the Let's think about that. Russia gave a powerful assist to the successful campaign to release a misleading document, undermining an ongoing FBI investigation.  Despite these disturbing facts, President Trump continues to be dismissive of claims of any Russian interference. For 6 months, Congress has expected the administration to impose the penalties in the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that passed 98 to 2, but the administration has not even issued one sanction through that law. Despite ongoing brazen Russian interference, the White House claims that sanctions are not needed because the threat of sanctions is already ``serving as a deterrent.'' The mere threat of sanctions clearly is not serving as a deterrent. Our national security agencies, NATO systems, and even the Senate have experienced countless cyber attacks since the 2016 elections. Yet Vladimir Putin continues to deny that Russia interferes in anything at all, and for support, Putin can point to President Trump's own denials of Russian interference.  President Trump has a penchant for labeling factual reports as ``fake news.'' Again and again, he says things that are obviously false or misleading. He calls responsible mainstream journalists ``the enemy of the people.'' He attacks the rule of law, the judiciary, and our law enforcement agencies. These are all classic hallmarks of the slippery slope toward authoritarianism. Indeed, it is striking how attacks by some Republicans on law enforcement and democratic institutions echo similar attacks by the Kremlin and its mouthpieces.  Consider these side-by-side comparisons of statements by Russian officials and statements by  As we see in this tweet, which is dated January 2, 2018, President Trump has described U.Government employees and the Justice Department as the ``Deep State.'' At the same time Russia's propaganda network, RT, has repeated this terminology. So we see this: ``Deep State takedown.'' Just yesterday, RT aired a discussion on how to root out the ``Deep State'' now that its biases supposedly have been exposed by the ``Nunes memo.''  Again, we see these mirrored messages between Republicans, the White House, and As we see in this panel, allegations that Special Counsel Mueller and the FBI are conducting a ``witch hunt'' are coming from the highest levels of both the American and Russian We see that Reuters has repeated a line from RIA, which is Russia's state television, saying: ``U.scandal over Russian contacts is `a witch hunt.''' That sentiment was repeated by Andy Biggs, a Republican who is calling on Mr.Mueller to ``end the witch hunt,'' and, of course, it was tweeted by Donald Trump, who called all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information a ``total witch hunt.''  In panel 3, we see that both Putin and President Trump claim that there is no way to know for sure who meddled in the U.election. You can see the two of them. They blame Democrats for allegations of Russian meddling. Putin said that ``maybe someone lying in bed'' was responsible. Looking at similar language, President Trump famously said: ``It could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.''  It is unfortunate that some Republicans, as well as voices in the conservative media, appear to believe that, in order to support the President, they must attack and discredit not only Special Counsel Mueller but also the Department of Justice and the These partisan attacks are baseless and reckless.  They will not succeed in deflecting law enforcement from its duties and mission. What they may do is that they may well succeed in undermining the American people's faith and confidence in these institutions so vital to a healthy democracy. That is not only unfortunate, but it is shameful.  Last summer Members of Congress came together on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis to impose sanctions on Russia because people here believed they were interfering in our elections. Republicans and Democrats spoke with one voice. We said: Our country has been attacked by a hostile power. We will not tolerate it, and we will stand together to stop it. Today, it is critical that we continue to speak with one voice in condemning Russia's interference.  This is a really remarkable moment in our country's history. A hostile foreign power has interfered in our Presidential election, and it continues to interfere. CIA Director Pompeo said, in no uncertain terms, that Russia will interfere in this year's midterm elections. Our law enforcement agencies and a special counsel are working diligently to undercover the scope and methods of Russia's interference so we can put a stop to it. Supporting these efforts is not about party and not about partisanship. It is about patriotism. It is about defending America's democracy, which has been attacked and continues to be vulnerable to attack.  Make no mistake. Our democracy is being tested, our law enforcement agencies are being tested, and we, as Senators, are being tested. We have a responsibility to come together--Senators of both parties--to defend the independence of the Justice Department and the We must insist that Special Counsel Mueller be allowed to conduct and complete his investigation without further political interference. We must stand together in opposing Russia's outrageous continuing interference in America's elections and domestic affairs.  I yield the floor.

326,topic-id,1036,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my friend for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I am sorry I can't support this continuing resolution today.  The great government of the United States of America that has been called ``the last best hope of man'' cannot be funded in tranches of maybe 2 weeks to 3 weeks. This is the fifth continuing resolution that we have done since the 30th of That is an atrocity. I mean, I can't think of any legislative body anywhere totally unable to do its job. And as sorry as I am to say it because of my great respect and affection for my fellow Members, I don't believe that this majority is capable of governing.  We are 2 days before the shutdown of the government of the United States, before it closes for business. Late last night, about 10 p.m., they finally released the details of this short-term spending bill. And we will be back here as soon as this one expires doing yet another one.  We are 5 months into the fiscal year, and this is the majority's fifth continuing resolution. We are virtually in the same position today as we were on September 8, December 7, December 21, and January 18 when this Chamber passed the prior continuing resolutions.  The majority isn't learning from any of this. They just keep repeating those mistakes. Like the bill before it, the proposal was written by and for the majority.  Let me repeat. The Democrats had virtually no say in this.  And once again, it ignores many of the priorities that we all agree need to be addressed: providing additional disaster relief after a storm season that saw historic wildfires, hurricanes, and mudslides; three rail wrecks in 2 weeks with fatalities, certainly proving to us, if we didn't know it already, that our neglect of the railroads, the bridges, the infrastructure in the United States is a mess. Saving America's endangered pensions is also a priority, and extending additional health access for our veterans certainly is not just a priority, but an obligation.                              {time}  1515  What is included here is woefully inadequate. This bill pays for extending community health centers--which is very important to me, let me hasten to add--by eviscerating funding for one of the most important parts of the Affordable Care Act that helps keep people well: the Prevention This fund focuses on children's health by expanding access to lifesaving vaccines and reducing the risk of lead poisoning, among many other things. The majority is paying for opening the centers by gutting the Prevention Fund while we are experiencing the worst flu epidemic in nearly a decade.  Now, I have heard a lot of talk about prioritizing the national defense. We don't take a back seat on our side to anybody who loves and respects the people who defend us, who every day--an all-volunteer military--stands on the line for us.  But we also believe that this bill does not raise the Budget Control Act sequester level of spending caps for nondefense. That is a shame, and it is also the Budget Control  Mr.Speaker, one-third of the nondefense domestic budget that we are trying to get parity for goes to national security, part of our defense: to our veterans, to homeland security, the State Department, the Justice Department, and counterterrorism initiatives.  Refusing to equally raise the defense and nondefense caps is irresponsible. Secretary of Defense General Mattis has said: No enemy is more harmful than unpredictable funding from  But it isn't just defense that has had undependable funding. Not a single agency of the Federal Government knows from one week to another whether they will be funded or what they can do. We have cut down on almost everything that they can do, including travel to places that they absolutely need to be. It is pretty awful.  We have had the warnings, yet here we are today with a fifth short-term continuing resolution. The majority has 238 seats in the Chamber, but it only holds 51 seats in the They have the ability to draft a partisan agenda, and routinely do.  And we just saw that spectacle coming from the Intelligence Committee in the House, when a memo, governed by the majority--and one was acted on and put out for the public--but we are waiting and hoping that the one for the minority will be given the approval by the President of the United  But for anything, including this bill, to have a chance of getting 60 votes in the Senate and becoming law, you have to involve the They don't have enough over there. Fifty-one is not 60. This is simple math.  The minority leader in the Senate has said this proposal is a nonstarter. He added that moving forward with this plan would ``jeopardize the positive discussions going on right now about the budget, immigration, disaster aid, and more.'' So we know, standing here today, that we are wasting our time.  We should finally bring an end to the continuing resolutions and the failed my-way-or-the-highway approach to governing. That is the only way the majority can fulfill what Speaker Ryan pledged when he took the gavel and said: ``Only a fully functioning House can truly represent the people. And If there were ever a time for us to step up, this would be that time.''  Mr.Speaker, the American people and the world have watched for months as the greatest democracy ever devised has been defined by its dysfunction. If ever there was one, this is the time for the majority to step up.  I am very much concerned, Mr.Speaker, that we are reaching the tipping point. That the dysfunction and chaos displayed not just with the actions of the stock market in the past 3 days, but our inability to really know whether or not we are going to keep the lights on has cost us dearly with respect to the rest of the world. And I need to point out as well, just a few minutes ago, the President of the United States thought that a government shutdown would be a good idea.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

329,topic-id,1166,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, President Trump said to reporters earlier today that if Congress can't reach a deal on immigration: ``I'd love to see a shutdown if we can't get this stuff taken care of. If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety . . . let's shut it down.''  We are also the people who were accused last week at the State of the Union--because we didn't show great enthusiasm for his speech--that we were treasonous. It is really pretty frightening to me, Mr.Speaker, what is going on here, and I can't avoid talking about it. I said earlier in the Rules Committee that I think we are reaching a tipping point, and I honestly do believe that.  But this isn't the first time that President Trump encouraged a government shutdown, which would be devastating. The last one we had was for 16 days and took $24 billion out of this economy. This is remarkable and, I think, pretty sad.  The President keeps injecting uncertainty into what already is a chaotic process from the majority. No one in this Chamber is against safety. We are asking them to take action on the bipartisan priorities that have languished while they passed tax cuts for millionaires.  In 2016, during an interview with CBS This Morning, President Trump said: ``I'm the king of debt. I'm great with debt. Nobody knows the debt better than me.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, according to this article from The Washington Post from February 3: ``The U.Treasury expects to borrow $955 billion this fiscal year. . . . It's the highest amount of borrowing in 6 years, and a big jump from the $519 billion the Federal Government borrowed last year.''  He is definitely the king of debt.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the article from The Washington Post titled: ``The U.Government is set to borrow nearly $1 trillion this year, an 84 percent jump from last year.''             [From the Washington Post, February 3, 2018.] The U.Government Is Set To Borrow Nearly $1 Trillion This Year, an                      84 Percent Jump From Last Year                           (By Heather Long)       It was another crazy news week, so it's understandable if      you missed a small but important announcement from the      Treasury Department: The federal government is on track to      borrow nearly $1 trillion this fiscal year--Trump's first      full year in charge of the budget.       That's almost double what the government borrowed in fiscal      2017.       Here are the exact figures: The U.Treasury expects to      borrow $955 billion this fiscal year, according to documents      released It's the highest amount of borrowing in      six years, and a big jump from the $519 billion the federal      government borrowed last year.       Treasury mainly attributed, the increase to the ``fiscal      outlook.'' The Congressional Budget Office was more blunt. In      a report this week, the CBO said tax receipts are going to be      lower because of the new tax law.       The uptick in borrowing is yet another complication in the      heated debates in Congress over whether to spend more money      on infrastructure, the military, disaster relief and other      domestic programs. The deficit is already up significantly,      even before Congress allots more money to any of these areas.       ``We're addicted to debt,'' says Marc Goldwein, senior      policy director at Committee for a Responsible Federal      He blames both parties for the situation.       What's particularly jarring is this is the first time      borrowing has jumped this much (as a share of GDP) in a non-     recession time since Ronald Reagan was president, says Ernie      Tedeschi, a former senior adviser to the U.Treasury who is      now head of fiscal analysis at Evercore Under Reagan,      borrowing spiked because of a buildup in the military,      something Trump is advocating again.       Trump didn't mention the debt--or the ongoing budget      deficits--in his State of the Union address. The absence of      any mention of the national debt was frustrating for Goldwein      and others who warn that America has a major economic problem      looming.       ``It is terrible. Those deficits and the debt that keeps      rising is a serious problem, not only in the long run, but      right now,'' Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, a former      Reagan adviser, told Bloomberg       The White House got a taste this week of just how      problematic this debt situation could get. Investors are      concerned about all the additional borrowing and the      likelihood of higher inflation, which is why the interest      rates on U.government bonds hit the highest level since      2014. That, in turn, partly drove the worst weekly sell-off      in the stock market in two years.       The belief in Washington and on Wall Street has long been      that the U.government could just keep issuing debt because      people around the world are eager to buy up this safe-haven      asset. But there may be a limit to how much the market wants,      especially if inflation starts rising and investors prefer to      ditch bonds for higher-returning stocks.       ``Some of my Wall Street clients are starting to talk      recession in 2019 because of these issues. Fiscal policy is      just out of control,'' says Peter Davis, a former tax      economist in Congress who now runs Davis Capital Investment            The Federal Reserve was also buying a lot of U.Treasury      debt since the crisis, helping to beef up demand. But the Fed      recently decided to stop doing that now that the economy has      improved. It's another wrinkle as Treasury has to look for      new buyers.       Tedeschi, the former Treasury adviser to the Obama      administration, calls it ``concerning, but not a crisis.''      Still, he says it's a ``big risk'' to plan on borrowing so      much in the coming years.       Trump's Treasury forecasts borrowing more than $1 trillion      in 2019 and more than $1.1 trillion in 2020. Before taking      office, Trump described himself as the ``king of debt,''      although he campaigned on reducing the national debt.       The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts the      U.deficit will hit $1 trillion by 2019 and stay there for      a while. The latest borrowing figure--$955 billion--released      this week was determined from a survey of bond market      participants, who tend to be even faster to react to the      changing policy landscape and change their forecasts.       Both parties claim they want to be ``fiscally      responsible,'' but Goldwein says they both pass legislation      that adds to the debt.[[Page H824]]     Politicians argue this is the last time they'll pass a bill      that makes the deficit worse, but so far, they just keep      going.       The latest example of largesse is the GOP tax bill. It's      expected to add $1 trillion or more to the debt, according to      nonpartisan analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation      (and yes, that's after accounting for some increased economic      growth).       But even before that, Goldwein points to the 2015 extension      of many tax cuts and the 2014 delays in Medicare      reimbursement cuts.       ``Every time you feed your addiction, you grow your      addiction,'' says       There doesn't seem to be any appetite for budgetary      restraint in Washington, but the market may force Congress's      hand.

350,topic-id,422,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have heard the majority speak with great urgency today about the need to pass the continuing resolution. But where was this urgency from the majority for the last 5 months of this fiscal year?  They were so consumed with providing tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations that they ignored virtually everything else.  This was a bill that was sold as a middle class tax cut. But 83 percent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent; and for corporations, the tax breaks are permanent. For individuals, they are sunsetted.  Speaker Ryan, over the weekend, promoted the fact that a secretary in Pennsylvania received an extra $1.50 a week under the tax scam. That is $78 a year for her. You can see what the middle class actually got.  But compare that with the wealthy. One analysis found that the Koch brothers and their corporate empire could save between $1 billion and $1.4 billion combined in income taxes every year as a result of the tax law. It is important to remember that this is a permanent cut.  It was a bill written for the rich to help the rich. It spends money we don't have, while adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit. That is such a staggering amount that the Congressional Budget Office said last week that because of this tax bill, our government now is expected to run out of money sooner than anticipated.  The deadline to raise the debt ceiling has now been moved from early April to mid-Only during the Second World War was our debt as a percentage of gross domestic product higher than it is today. I hope we can forever end the myth that the majority is the party of fiscal discipline. The situation we are in today is a direct result of the majority prioritizing the wealthy over doing the most basic functions of keeping the government running.  And now, after ignoring Democrats as this bill was drafted, they expect us to fall in line and support a flawed proposal. That is not how it works. If they want our support, they need to work with us. And Democrats have been clear: We cannot afford to keep kicking the can down the road. It is past time for a long-term bill that addresses urgent national priorities.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, on the rule, and the bill.

620,topic-id,280,"Lastly, Mr.Speaker, I would like to talk a little bit about the national debt and what we see going into 2018.  It was reported this week that the U.Government is set to borrow over $1 trillion in 2018--approximately $955 billion--which is an 84 percent increase from 2017.  The Congressional Budget Office reports quite clearly: Tax receipts are going to be lower because of the new tax law.  This is increasing bond yields, which is directly related to the recent stockmarket decline of nearly 1,800 points that we have seen over the last 2 days of trading, because we see higher interest rates, the highest for bonds since 2014. As a result, we have been watching a precipitous decline--the largest in American history--by actual number of points.  President Trump's Department of the Treasury forecasts borrowing over $1 trillion in 2019 and over $1.1 trillion in 2020.  President Trump has described himself as the ``King of Debt,'' despite campaigning on reducing the national debt. What we worry about is that the tax plan will be mortgaging our future for today.  And guess who pays the bill?  Our children, who will have to repay a massive debt; our seniors, who could face cuts to Medicare and Social Security; and every American, due to a declining economy.  We must take this seriously. And $1 trillion being doubled the year before and going over $1 trillion next year, and $1.1 trillion the following year is not sustainable for our I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to fix this growing crushing debt before it is too late.

328,topic-id,499,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those kind words. Chairman Sessions is a hero of mine. There are a lot of reasons why I hold[[Page H823]]him in such high regard. One of the reasons is that he understands a couple of very important things.  I think the first thing he understands is that the primary responsibility of the Federal Government is to keep Americans safe in a chaotic world. The second thing he understands is that nothing is more important than thing one.  It is for these reasons that I rise in strong support of the rule and the underlying legislation to fund our military. Our inability to constantly fund our Federal Government has real consequences, but it has no greater consequence than it has for our military members.  Nothing impacts our military with more devastating effect than the lack of sustained, predictable funding. We need to do what is right for the men and women in uniform charged with defending our country, including, I might add, members of my own family who are deployed, even as we speak.  The uncertainty of funding creates problems in the supply chain with regard to everything from large acquisitions to the smallest repair part. It impacts training as funding is needed to lock in major events to include logistical support, movement of personnel and equipment, and access to sufficient types and quantities of munitions. I have spoken with military members, as recently as the last few weeks, who told me about their funding and their training being canceled because of the threat of a government shutdown. It has implications for their safety and their well-being.  In a letter to Congress last September, Secretary Mattis warned of the consequences: funding through a CR cannot be reprogrammed; training impacts begin immediately, as I have said; and hiring actions and recruiting is curtailed.  The bottom line is this: governing by crisis has had an enormous impact on our military, and it is time we do what is right and fully fund our country's defense.  Funding the Department of Defense in the year 2018 will keep Americans safe by boosting our national defense and give a much-needed pay raise to our troops and an increase in end strength for the Active Duty, Guard, and the  Let me end with a personal observation. These wings that I proudly wear are my father's Air Force wings. He was an Air Force pilot in World War He had five sons who served in the military. I am proud to say that I was one of them, as Chairman Sessions has indicated. As I indicated as well, I have members of my own family who are deployed now, or will deploy in the next year. These young men and women put their lives on the line to serve and to protect our country. For heaven's sake, let's give them the funding to do that. Let's do the right thing.

630,topic-id,225,"Mr.Speaker, last week I received a letter from Frank Suits, Frank is the president and CEO of Suit-Kote Corporation, a family-owned, multigenerational paving company located in the 22nd District, in Cortland, New He wrote to share the impact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on Suit-Kote's nearly 800 families.  As a direct result of the lower income tax brackets included in the tax cuts legislation, Suit-Kote employees receive an automatic 2 percent increase in their take-home pay in 2018. This increase means about $1,400, on average, in the paychecks of each hardworking family.  Suit-Kote's 401(k) plan has also increased by 11.5 percent and totals more than $56 million. This means that each individual employee saw an average increase of more than $6,400 in their 401(k) savings plan.  In direct response to the new tax law, Suit-Kote Corporation has announced plans to match the Federal tax cut and provide its employees with a 2 percent retroactive pay increase. They also plan to accelerate its 401(k) contribution for 2018 by 4 months to provide employees additional funds in their retirement accounts.  The benefits are not crumbs. These are actual results involving real people.  Small businesses like Suit-Kote are proof that delivering desperately needed tax cuts are the most effective way to improve the lives of New Yorkers, not Albany's oppressive tax-and-spend, cronyist policies.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgH898.txt,2344,ADJOURNMENT,2018.0,6.0,February
468,topic-id,1343,"Mr.President, the good news for American workers continues to roll in. Just take a look at the headlines from the last week: ``Pfizer Plans $5 Billion Boost in U.Manufacturing From Tax Law Changes''; ``Cigna raises wages, benefits following tax law''; ``CEO: Lehigh Valley small businesses to benefit from federal tax overhaul''; ``Altria Group will pay $3,000 bonus to all non-executive employees''; ``Ozarks workers to receive bonuses, benefits thanks to tax changes''; ``Charter Sets $15 Minimum Wage''; ``Lowe's to pay U.staff $1,000 bonus following tax reform.''  The number of companies increasing wages, boosting retirement contributions, or handing out bonuses thanks to tax reform continues to soar. Last week at this time, the number was over 250; now it is up over 300, and it keeps growing. Businesses are making plans to invest in their workers, raise wages, create new jobs, and invest in the U.economy. Fiat Chrysler, AT&T, Boeing, Home Depot, Great Western Bank in my home State of South Dakota, AaLadin Industries, Southwest, Best Buy, AccuWeather, Visa, Nationwide Insurance, Jet Blue--the list of companies announcing good news for American workers thanks to tax reform goes on and on.  The Nation's largest private employer, Walmart, announced an increase in its starting wage for hourly employees and bonuses for eligible employees. It also announced expanded maternity and parental leave benefits and the creation of a new adoption benefit for employees. More than 1 million Walmart employees will benefit from these changes.  JPMorgan Chase announced that it will raise wages for 22,000 workers, add thousands of jobs, and open 400 new branches in the United It also plans to increase its lending to small businesses.  Tech giant Apple announced that thanks to tax reform, it will bring home to the United States almost $250 billion in cash it has been keeping overseas and finally now invest it here in the United It also announced that it will create 20,000 new jobs and provide $2,500 stock bonuses to its employees.  FedEx announced plans to expedite raises and invest $1.5 billion to expand its FedEx Express hub in It is also making a $1.5 billion contribution to its pension plan.  Last week, ExxonMobil announced that thanks in part to tax reform, it will invest an additional $35 billion in the U.economy over the next 5 years. That means a lot of new jobs and opportunities for American workers.  As I said before, I could go on and on. It is important to remember that this is just the beginning. To date, companies have barely experienced the benefits of tax reform, and already they are moving to invest in their workers and in the economy. As the benefits of tax reform continue to sink in and accrue, we can expect to see more growth, more jobs, and more opportunities for American workers.  The past month of good news is the reason we made business tax reform a key part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs We are deeply committed to immediate relief for the American people, which is why we cut tax rates, doubled the standard deduction, and doubled the child tax credit, delivering immediate, meaningful tax relief to middle-class families in this country. But we want more for American workers than just a tax cut, as valuable as those are; we also want American workers to have access to the kinds of jobs and opportunities that will set them up for security and prosperity for the long term. Good jobs, good wages, and good opportunities were in short supply during the last Presidency, and we are determined to improve things for American workers. So we took action to improve the situation for American businesses since the only way individual Americans thrive is if American businesses and the American economy thrive.  Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, American businesses large and small were weighed down by high tax rates and growth-killing tax provisions. Plus, our outdated international tax rules left America's global businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed all that. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners with small- and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We expanded business owners' ability to recover investments they make in their businesses, which will free up cash that they can invest in their operations and their workers. We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate, which, up until January 1 of this year, was the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. We brought the U.international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors.  Now, just a month and a half into the new tax law, we are already seeing the results: increased investment in the American economy, job creation, higher wages, and benefit increases. As the tax law helps U.businesses large and small grow and thrive, we can expect to see a lot more benefits and opportunities for American workers in the future.  Before I close, Mr.President, I would like to say a couple words about the Defense appropriations bill we are taking up this week.  By the end of the Obama administration, our military was facing a serious readiness shortfall. The Obama administration's failure to prioritize defense left our Armed Forces with manpower deficits and delayed the acquisition of 21st-century weapons and equipment.  The Defense appropriations bill we will vote on this week provides critical funding for restoring military readiness and would be a downpayment on equipping our troops with the resources they need to meet the threats of the 21st century. Unfortunately, passage of this bill is in jeopardy here in the Senate, thanks to Senate Democrats have blocked a Defense appropriations bill six times over the past almost 3 years now, and they look set to block that bill once again. That is not acceptable.  Funding the government by continuing resolution rather than by appropriations bills is never ideal, but it is particularly problematic for the military. Under a continuing resolution, new programs are delayed, and the military's ability to transfer money between accounts--for acquisition purposes, for example--is restricted. That is a big problem when the security of our Nation depends on the very programs and purchases the military makes.  Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned that ``long-term CRs impact the readiness of our forces and their equipment at a time when security threats are extraordinarily high''--not to mention at a time when our military is already under extra pressure as it works to repair the deficits of the Obama years.  Passing a defense appropriations bill, instead of subjecting the military to a constant procession of continuing resolutions, would go a long way toward ensuring our military men and women are prepared to confront the threats that are facing our It is too bad that Democrats seem to be unable to look beyond politics to the needs of our military. Democrats may not pay a price for opposing this bill this week, but our military will.  It is high time that we pass the Defense appropriations bill. We need to stop this obstruction, stop this blocking. Six times in the last 3 years already they have blocked passage of Defense appropriations, and here we are again faced this week with yet another opportunity to provide the critical and necessary funding for the American military--our men and women in uniform who every single day are out there defending our freedoms--and it looks as though yet again the Democrats intend to block that critical, important funding. This needs to come to an end. This isn't about politics; this is about America's national security interests. I hope we can come together and recognize that and put the best interests of America's national security and our men and women in uniform ahead of politics.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.[[Page S631]]  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

For his valor in battle, Gerczak was posthumously awarded both the Silver Star and Purple The USS LST-66's entire crew was also given the Presidential Unit It is exceptionally fitting that Gerczak be honored for the sacrifice he gave during World War II by having his name live on in the service of the U.Coast  The USCGC Joseph Gerczak will be the second FRC based in Honolulu, HI, replacing the legacy Island-class patrol boats.

539,topic-id,587,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this bill, H.772, is a bipartisan piece of legislation introduced by Representatives Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Tony Cardenas to amend the Food and Drug Administration's menu labeling rule that was issued in November of 2014.  The goal of the bill was to make implementation of the nutrition disclosure law useful for consumers and workable for food service establishments. The existing regulatory framework, which has not yet been implemented, is not only cumbersome for the food industry, but it also impedes businesses' ability to provide meaningful information that customers can use to make nutrition decisions.  The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act is critical to avoid harming consumers' choices, jobs, and, certainly, small businesses. This bill was drafted to address the challenges of an overly prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach to regulation affecting a very, very diverse industry.  We need to ensure that the law works for all food establishments: convenience stores, supermarkets, grocery stores, pizza shops. All have enormous challenges complying with the regulations as written.  This bill is going to provide those entities with the flexibility and, frankly, the certainty that they need to comply without compromising consumers' access to nutrition information. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act will establish a more reasonable standard for Federal regulations and allow nutritional information to be provided by a remote access menu for establishments where the majority of orders, in fact, are placed off premises.                              {time}  1245  Consumers should have this information when they are placing an order. A menu board may work for some businesses where customers order at the counter where they also pay, but for an establishment where most people now order online or from a phone, having the calorie information when they pick up their order won't be very helpful to that consumer.  This legislation also takes steps to preserve local foods and fresh items that might be sold at just a few locations. To do so, the bill clarifies that menu labeling regulations are intended for standard menu items, defined as those items with substantially the same recipe prepared in substantially the same way with substantially the same food components that are routinely included on a menu or menu board or are routinely offered as a self-service food or food on display at 20 or more locations.  This bill also eliminates draconian penalties that are required in current law by removing criminal felony penalties for store managers and allowing restaurants and retailers to take corrective actions. This shields small-business owners and their employees from frivolous lawsuits based on inadvertent human error. No one ought to be criminalized for putting too many pickles on a sandwich or maybe not enough olives. This bill further clarifies that establishments will have 90 days to correct a violation before FDA brings enforcement action.  The food retail sector employs--let's face it--millions of Americans and provides access to affordable, healthy options. The Federal Government shouldn't impose arbitrary regulations that are going to cause unnecessary harm to businesses and consumers.  The businesses impacted by this bill widely support providing consumers with nutritional information to better inform their food decisions, but they want to do it in a practical and a commonsense way. This legislation provides clear guidance to small-business owners, ensuring compliance and, at the same time, delivering critical information.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues for their work on both sides of the aisle. I urge its passage today, and I reserve the balance of my time.

541,topic-id,294,"Mr.Speaker, I know that I have other speakers, so I am going to stall a little bit for time here. I am told that some of them may be at Jimmy John's trying to get through that menu wondering if they should have olives or pickles or Dijon mustard or mayonnaise, but they are on their way.  I want to say we all want consumer information--we do--but we ought to be able to agree that food service establishments shouldn't face Federal criminal penalties for inadvertent failures to comply with the FDA's framework.  Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, food labeling has to be truthful and non-misleading. Food labeling that doesn't meet FDA's standard for truthful and non-misleading is deemed misbranded. Under U.Code, introducing misbranded food into commerce is, in fact, a prohibited act, and the liable party shall be imprisoned for up to a year, fined not more than $1,000, or both.  Food to which these menu labeling requirements apply is deemed misbranded if the FDA's rule requirement is not met, so it is not necessary that the person intentionally misleads customers. Under FDA's framework, merely adding that extra olive or pepperoni is going to render the calorie content on the menu misleading and the chef then becomes criminal.  Come on. People say that the FDA won't put people in jail over this, so I don't think there ought to be an issue codifying that in statute. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act will give folks an opportunity to correct inadvertent mistakes so long as they were acting in good faith, and they are going to make standards far more reasonable.

Mr.I rise to express my strong opposition to H.772, the so-called Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure  I have worked at every level of the restaurant business, starting as a dishwasher and busboy, and eventually managing and owning various restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area. As a former restaurateur and a member of the California Restaurant Association, I have a deep appreciation for the value American consumers place on nutritional information when determining their food purchases.  Numerous studies, like the International Food Information Council and elsewhere, suggest that nutritional information is second only to taste when choosing what to eat from a menu. Other peer-reviewed studies have found that consumers make healthier choices when nutrition information is placed directly on the menu.  Making nutrition information readily available and standardized is an important step in fighting the growing epidemic of obesity and chronic disease. According to the CDC, more than two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, nearly a third of American children are overweight, and the prevalence of childhood obesity children has more than tripled since 1971.  That is why, as a California State Senator, I co-authored the first-in-the-nation menu labeling law. This bipartisan legislation was passed with industry support and cooperation, and signed by a Republican governor.  In contrast, the bill before us today creates giant loopholes in the ACA's national menu labeling provisions and allows selected establishments to arbitrarily determine serving sizes, and obscure the total number of servings per item. For example, if this bill would become law pizza chains, supermarkets, and convenience stores would be exempt from having to provide information to consumers at the point-of-sale. The bill would also further delay the implementation of our existing nationwide menu labeling efforts that are supported by more than 75 percent of American consumers.  Particularly harmful for my constituents, H.772 would preempt state efforts to address the obesity epidemic locally. The bill also undermines state and local efforts to enforce or enact their own food labeling laws, and extends to food labelling in general, not simply menu labeling as the bill's title would lead us to believe.  This misguided legislation unravels all of the cooperative work being done by the restaurant industry and government agencies across the nation. I urge my colleagues to oppose this effort to undermine local transparency efforts and vote No on H.772.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

What brings us here today is really important work. What brings us here today is that we are taking care of significant public healthcare issues. We are fully funding for the next 2 years community health centers.[[Page H895]]  I have heard from my colleagues about the things that aren't in this bill that they wish were, so that is why they are going to vote ``no,'' or some other thing that is not even before us and that is why they are going to vote ``no.''  But let's talk about what is actually before us.  What is before us is taking care of our men and women in uniform and their needs, especially when they are in harm's way, and fund really, really important public health programs that used to always be bipartisan.  Let's talk about those. Valley Family Health Care Outreach Center in Ontario and Winding Waters Clinic in Wallowa I have visited both of these recently. They are on the front lines of healthcare prevention. They are on the front lines of saving lives and helping children and adults. Or La Clinica down in the Medford-Ashland area.  In fact, in my district, we have 12 federally qualified health centers and 63 delivery sites that give care for 240,000 Twenty-four million nationwide are served by this.  On November 3, this House had the opportunity to fully fund those community health centers for 2 years and take care of children's health insurance and a lot of these other programs. It was a separate bill brought to the House floor, and a handful of Democrats broke with their party and voted with us. But, unfortunately, when it got to the Senate, they couldn't be freed up to support it. So we had to come back in the last continuing resolution and fully fund the Children's Health Insurance I am not sure many Democrats voted for that here, unfortunately.  But here we are today, same process, same situation to fund community health centers. So we are going to do that. Your choice when you vote is ``yes'' or ``no,'' you want the community health centers funded or not, you want to shut the government down or not, you want to take care of our military or not.  Then there is the disproportionate share hospitals.  What are those?  Those are the hospitals in our districts and States that take care disproportionately of more poorer people than other hospitals. Under the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare, however you want to describe it, there was prescribed in law automatic cuts to these hospitals that take care of the poorest of the poor in our communities. Those cuts totaled $2 billion.  In this legislation, as in the legislation we brought from the Energy and Commerce Committee on November 3, we turn off those cuts. We say: Don't do that to our DSH hospitals.  If you are at Saint Alphonsus in Ontario, Oregon, that is the most affected hospital, I am told, and they will lose money and have to decide how they cope with that. We solve that here for 2 years at $6.8 million in my  Then we extend the special diabetes programs. For heaven's sake, we should be able to come together in this Chamber and in this Congress to take care of people with diabetes. My grandfather lost both legs due to diabetes. They were amputated. I have other relatives and good friends whose kids have dealt with diabetes and still do to this day.  For our Native Americans and others, we have two separate programs. We fully fund them and tie them together. That is done in this legislation. Fifty thousand people in my district have diabetes. My hunch is all of our districts are not dissimilar from that. We take care of those people in this legislation.  Then we take care of therapy caps. Since 1997, when this law was put in place, people who needed physical therapy--my colleague from Tennessee talked about it--stroke victims, seniors who need therapy, rather than the physical therapist or the speech therapist saying, ``Here is the program you need to get well, get on your feet, recover from whatever it is that afflicts you,'' the government put an arbitrary cap, and that was it. You were done whether you were done or not.  Everybody is different in terms of recovery. We repeal the therapy caps in here.  By the way, we have heard about all these things that now won't get funded because a part of this funding comes out of the Public Prevention Mr.Speaker, $2.85 billion is not insignificant, it is true, but we are applying that money to help prevention and community health centers, as we did before for the Children's Health Insurance  We are providing it for diabetes health. We are removing the physical therapy caps so that people can get well. That seems to me to be pretty good use of the Prevention  By the way, during the same period we are spending $2.85 billion out of that, there will still remain $12 billion left, and the talented folks at the Appropriations Committee will decide how that money is spent on vaccines and all these other issues, all these things we care about. There is still $12 billion left. So we are using discretionary funds that were set aside for that very purpose here.  Then we heard about some Medicaid cuts. Let me tell you what those are. We said: If you are a big lottery winner, maybe now that you have won a big prize, you shouldn't be on government-funded Medicaid because, by the way, you won a bazillion dollars.  So we are taking lottery winners and saying you have got to treat that big windfall when you calculate whether that person is poor or not anymore. So that is in here.  Then, on third-party liability, we said that if insurers actually are responsible for the cost, insurers should pay the cost rather than the taxpayer. So we make a little reform here that puts the insurers first to pay rather than the taxpayer.

479,topic-id,960,"Mr.President, one of Rhode Island's contributions to the cultural life of our Nation came from two brothers who grew up in Cumberland, RI, Bobby and Peter The Farrelly brothers did a number of movies. One of them was famously called ``Dumb and Dumber.''  This is a good example of dumb and dumber. It was dumb when President Obama opened the south Atlantic coast to the prospect of oil drilling. When he did, the reaction was immediate and profound. From Norfolk, VA, all the way down the red south Atlantic coast to Augustine, FL, city after city, county after county, coastal community after coastal community passed resolutions saying: Get that offshore drilling out of here. We don't want it. It was a sweep of that Republican shoreline. It was called the resolution revolution because so many resolutions were passed saying: Get your oil drilling the heck away from our coasts.  Ultimately, the Obama administration got smart, and in the final approval, there was no drilling in the Atlantic and no drilling in the They gave some reasons for their choice: strong local opposition was one, conflicts with other ocean uses was another, market dynamics was a third, and comments received from Governors was a fourth.  So, in the wake of that, here comes the Trump administration, and they have seriously gone from dumb to dumber, to go right back into this fight, where it blew up in the Obama administration's face among the red State communities of the Atlantic coast. Good luck finding support for this up in New  In New England, our ocean economy was valued just a few years ago at over $17 billion. It employs about a quarter of a million people. Who thinks we are going to walk away from that? Who thinks we are not going to defend that ocean economy against an idea as dumb as offshore drilling in the Atlantic? We are not going to permit it.  I have authored, with my House colleague David Cicilline, legislation that the whole New England Senate representation supports, to ban this as a matter of Federal law; to stop this. The attorneys general of States from Maine down to North Carolina, including Massachusetts, Delaware, Rhode Island, of course, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, and Virginia, all have spoken out against this and I expect will litigate against it. Our Governor, Gina Raimondo, has come out strongly against this incredibly dumb idea, and she has been joined by Republican Governors in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland, and South Carolina because this is such a dumb idea.  Why would this administration pursue such a dumb idea, that Republican Governors oppose, that blew up in the face of the Obama administration along the south Atlantic coast when they tried it, that would infringe upon and damage critical coastal economies in States that are Republican and Democratic? Why would they do such a stupid thing?  Well, Attorney General Kilmartin of Rhode Island has one suggestion: ``This decision by the administration is clearly driven by the oil and gas industry.''  No kidding. This administration is bought and paid for by the oil and gas industry. Throw in coal, and we have the complete lock, stock, and barrel sale. We have complete industry toadies in the responsible agencies of[[Page S636]]government and climate denial of the most flagrant and obtuse variety coming out of the White I mean, it is nonsense land, except for the fact that it keeps the oil and gas and coal money coming to prop up the Trump administration and the Republican We are not going to stand for it. It is crooked. It will not go.  Chris Brown is the head of the Commercial Fishermen's Association of Rhode He is adamant that ``oil drilling is something that is incredibly threatening and directly adverse to our well-being.''  We are going to stand and fight for our fishing communities.  Our environmental community is wildly against this: ``The last thing our coast needs is oil drilling and all of the risks that go with it,'' says our lead environmental organization, Save the  I will close with the Providence Business Journal, the voice of the Rhode Island business community, which just editorialized:       Fossil fuels, no matter where they are harvested, are      putting coastal areas across the globe in danger as sea      levels rise. In the name of national energy independence,      public policy would hasten the devastating impacts of burning      fossil fuels and make much of Rhode Island and other low-     lying areas uninhabitable.       At a time when renewable energy in the United States and      across the world is becoming less expensive, and the effects      of climate change are becoming more pronounced, pulling more      fossil fuels out of the ground is not a wise decision, and      one that hopefully will be rescinded before any drilling rigs      park themselves off Block  That is the voice of Rhode Island's business community.  If you want to take a look at why this bothers us, take a look at the footprint of the BP oilspill laid on the map of the New England coast. There is Boston, there is Long Island, there is Narragansett Bay, and that is Rhode That is the footprint of the mess the oil industry left when it blew up its facility in the middle of the gulf. That is what they did, and we don't need that up in New  We have offshore industries that are vibrant, that support our economy, that are welcome, that have long traditions and histories.

485,topic-id,495,"Mr.President, a number of my colleagues will be coming to the floor this afternoon to discuss the predicament we face as the Mueller investigation--the special counsel investigation, the Department of Justice--closes in on the Trump White House and the Trump campaign, creating two problems. One is an unprecedented attack on the law enforcement institutions that are involved in that investigation, an effort to discredit our Federal Bureau of Investigation and our Department of Justice, including the suggestion that this whole thing is a witch hunt, even though every single witness, including Trump appointees who have come before our committees, has been asked ``Hey, this investigation, is it a witch hunt?'' and, to a person, has said no.  Russian interference was real, they are coming back in 2018, and it is no witch hunt to look into what took place.  You have this whole smear effort going on of individuals and institutions involved in the institution. You could call that the crime of commission, if you would. The crime of omission that accompanies that is, while the majority in both Houses is busy trying to smear the FBI, the Department of Justice, and various individuals in this investigation, they are not taking the steps necessary to protect the 2018 elections. We have done virtually nothing.  The one thing we have done--led by Ranking Member Ben Cardin, the Senator from Maryland--was to get really strong sanctions put through. We all agreed on that. I think the vote was 98 to 2 in the Senate--98 to 2, powerful sanctions.  You messed in our elections. Here is one in the nose for you. Don't do it again.  That was the lesson. We are going after you, Mr.Putin, where it hurts, which is with all your dirty, corrupt oligarchs who support you and whom you pay to stay in power. That is the shot we took back. You messed in our elections; we are going after your crooked oligarchs.  Except guess where that effort stopped dead--in the Oval Office, at the President's desk, where President Trump will not let the Russia sanctions go forward. We have this whole smear campaign, discrediting honorable American institutions just to protect the President from the investigation. We have nothing being done legislatively to protect the 2018 elections, and you have the one thing we did do to send the message to the Russians that we are tired of this nonsense and to give them a little bit of a pop in the nose to get them to knock it off, a little deterrent, and the President will not act on it.  I am going to be here for the duration of this and have more to say, but I want to yield to the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who was so important in getting these sanctions through and understands very well, from his work on the Magnitsky issue, what these Russian oligarchs are up to.

494,topic-id,824,"Mr.President, indisputably, Vladimir Putin conducted a broadly based attack on American democracy and its most important institutions. Tragically, Putin's broadly based attack on American democracy and our institutions is echoed by President Trump's attack on American democracy and our most important institutions. And tragically or pathetically--I don't know which to say--that attack is echoed by a broad Republican attack on American democracy and institutions.  We can and should take steps to defend our American democracy. They are not terribly complicated.  1, stop attacking our own institutions. We can start there. We are doing Putin's work when we attack our own institutions.  2, step up to protect our own elections. All of our national security witnesses have warned that they are coming after us in 2018 with more election interference. Yet what have we done?  3, stop sheltering Putin and his oligarchs from consequences. We passed sanctions against Russian oligarchs and Putin and Russia for this very thing--messing around in our elections--through the Senate 98 to 2. The effective date of them has run. Yet the President won't enforce them. Stop sheltering Putin and his oligarchs.  4, clean up the dark channels of foreign influence and corruption. We know what they are because we have seen this play out in European countries and former Soviet Union countries. We know how it works. We have similar vulnerabilities. Fix them.  Those are four things that are not hard to do.[[Page S646]]  A fifth would be serious investigations by Congress--not tiptoe investigations but ones where we take hard looks, ask hard questions, and demand hard evidence.  No one in the Senate has tangled more with Vladimir Putin than our friend John Senator McCain has tangled with him so often that he has actually been blacklisted from travel to What Senator McCain said last week is something we should take to heart: ``The latest attacks against the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests--no party's, no President's, only Vladimir Putin's.''  He also said this: ``Our Nation's elected officials, including the President, must stop looking at this investigation through the lens of politics and manufacturing political sideshows.'' Instead, we need to be looking at the situation through the lens of our national security.  Here is what America's national security professionals tell us. First, they concluded: ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential election.''  I will continue. ``Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.Democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.''  They concluded: ``We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.''  We went on with this important conclusion in the January 2017 intelligence community assessment: ``We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the U.presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against U.allies and their election processes.''  We know they are coming. We have been warned by Trump's own appointees that they are coming. Yet we do nothing. As Putin would say, ``nichego.''  Well, right now that leaves Congress complicit, but it doesn't have to be this way, and it ought not be this way. It is not too late to defend our democracy and to teach Russia and the world some different lessons about who we are. What are the things we could do? Well, we could defend our democracy from Russian political influence.  Let's take legislative action to secure election infrastructure, improve our cyber security, counter and blunt Russian propaganda, and keep foreign money out of our politics. That ought not to be too hard to ask.  Let's defend our democracy from future Russian and foreign meddling. Let's insist on the implementation and enforcement of the sanctions against We passed them 98 to 2 for a reason. Why is President Trump sheltering Putin and the oligarchs from that punch? Let's insist on the message being delivered that we don't tolerate this behavior and that we will deter it with serious sanctions.  Let's insist on transparency. Let's insist on transparency about foreign financial interference in our country, through shell corporations in particular, and let's insist on transparency about the President's foreign financial dealings and conflicts of interest.  Finally, let's pass legislation to protect the special counsel from interference and obstruction. I have been a U.attorney. I understand the role of an independent and honorable Department of I understand, as we all should, that no man--not even the President--is above the law. And like many colleagues who have served in the Department of Justice, I expect, as they all expect, that even under the pressure, the threats, and the intimidation brought by the President against this Department of Justice, it will do its job. As FBI Director Christopher Wray recently said, ``We expect them to keep calm and tackle hard.''  I see the majority leader is on the floor.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

473,topic-id,798,"Mr.President, I thank both of my colleagues, and I thank my colleague from Florida for his courtesy. I am going to be brief.  My views on this issue can be summed up in a tweet that I sent on I was home having town meetings. I go to every county every year, and I had just wrapped up in Astoria, and I was on my way to  We stopped at Rockaway Beach, on the spectacular Oregon coast, and I decided that I would send a tweet and start it off with a question: Drilling on the Oregon coast? The answer was this: You have got to be kidding me. On my watch, that is going to be the policy we[[Page S633]]are going to have for protecting the Oregon coast. That is what Oregonians are saying today, specifically. In fact, Oregonians are lining up to make their opposition known by protesting this proposal outside a meeting today, hosted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in  We have a picturesque coastline that looks as if it is right out of a storybook. It is 362 miles that supports 22,000 jobs and a $2 billion economy. Tourism, fishing, and recreation are all dependent on a healthy Pacific  Our coast is entirely publicly owned, and it has been protected from oil and gas drilling for decades. That is, in large part, because we have learned harsh lessons from the past. In 1999, the freighter New Carissa ran aground off the coast of Coos The ship split apart, spilling tens of thousands of gallons of oil and diesel that covered our beaches in oil and tar balls. Some of that toxic mess remained on our beaches for almost a decade, costing tens of millions of dollars to clean up.  The thousands of fishermen, recreation business owners, and guides shouldn't have to go to bed at night hoping there is not a spill or an explosion--or risk their livelihoods on the good will of oil and gas executives. To make matters even more ominous, just days before announcing his intention to open up our entire coastline to oil and gas drilling, Secretary Zinke reversed basic safety standards for workers that were adopted after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. So what you have here is a double whammy. First, gut safety standards for oil and gas workers on offshore rigs. That is right; gut the safety standards for oil and gas workers. Second, increase the probability that these workers are going to be put in danger in the first place.  As I said on Saturday on my way to those town meetings, the people of my State, Oregonians, overwhelmingly do not want to be a part of any of this. Secretary Zinke went ahead and made a wrong decision with respect to coastal drilling without any input from Our commercial and recreational fisheries industry--hard-working families who depend on healthy fishing stocks--had no seat at the table. In fact, an entire west coast industry was left out of whatever discussions happened between the oil executives and the Trump officials in the back room of the Department of the  One day after his decision, Mr.Zinke met with the Republican Governor of Florida, and my colleague who will speak next has been eloquent on that point, describing the plan as a threat to the environment and economy of his home That was enough for Secretary Zinke to let Florida off the hook, but there has been an outcry of opposition from the Governors of 15 coastal States, including mine. We have raised the very same environmental and economic concerns, yet Secretary Zinke seems deaf to our voices. I guess the only voice that is really relevant is that of a Republican Governor, and that is about as nakedly political as it gets around Washington--a big gift for the oil and gas companies but one that poses an enormous danger to the economies and environment of local communities along our coast.  Finally, the decision doesn't make sense in terms of energy policy. Our country is more energy-secure now than ever. The International Energy Agency reports that within 10 years the United States will move from being a net importer of oil to a net exporter. So Secretary Zinke's scheme to expand offshore drilling is going to benefit--let's acknowledge that--a handful of Big Oil interests and then leave hard-working fishing families and coastal business owners to pick up the bill. That is not how we do things on our west coast.  The lasting economic uncertainty and ultimate environmental degradation are not worth it, and today, on behalf of the people of Oregon, I urge Secretary Zinke to rescind his proposal.  I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Florida for his courtesy.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Daines). The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS628-2.txt,1247,THE JOURNAL,2018.0,6.0,February
491,topic-id,590,"Mr.President, I want to thank my colleague from Hawaii for a very eloquent statement. I so appreciate her leadership and miss her on the Intelligence I also want to express my appreciation to the organizers of this effort--Senator Whitehouse and Senator Blumenthal--who have been tenacious in pursuing these issues. Both of them serve on the Judiciary Committee, and I serve on the Intelligence  It is quite obvious what has been going on in the last few weeks. The President, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and others are working hard to get the American people just to forget that our country is in the middle of an ongoing national security crisis. Russia has attacked our democracy; Russia has intervened in our election; and there is every reason to believe that they are just going to keep doing it.  In the year since the assessment I mentioned was conducted by the intelligence community, virtually everyone has come to see it this way. Donald Trump obviously disagrees. The only change has been the extent to which Donald Trump's protectors are willing to go out and throw dust in the air to prevent America from focusing on this direct threat to the people of this country and our very system of government.  Congress has to get to the bottom of what has been done to our democracy, but the fact is, the Senate has been stonewalled, particularly when it comes to the crucial issues of following the money. It began when Donald Trump refused to do what every other Presidential candidate has done now for four decades; that is, release his tax returns. It continues on other fronts. I have repeatedly asked the Secretary of the Treasury to provide the Senate Finance Committee with Treasury Department documents that would allow investigators to follow the money between Russia, Donald Trump, and his associates. The committee has been given nothing. Secretary Mnuchin has simply refused to cooperate with congressional oversight conducted by members of the committee that has direct jurisdiction over his agency.  So the question is, Mr.President, what are you hiding? What is in those tax returns and those financial documents that you don't want revealed? What would be so damaging?  It seems to me that if you are to understand Russia's ability to undermine our democracy, it is essential to follow the money. Donald Trump's family has acknowledged its financial ties to In fact, in 2008 and 2009, when it was pretty hard to get money for investment, the Trump family said--their words, not mine: Much of our portfolio comes from the  The special counsel included extensive information on money laundering and tax evasion in his recent indictment of Paul There have been dozens and dozens of press stories--it seems there are several every week--about the finances of the President and his associates that warrant real congressional oversight.  Americans are alarmed by the administration's stonewalling, and millions have been appalled by the idea that this would somehow be treated like just another political game. Those who abuse the classification system to put out a laughable partisan memo that doesn't stand up to scrutiny apparently are willing to do it just to protect the President at any cost.  The cost is our national security. The cost is our democracy. No matter how much the President and his protectors in Congress try to change the subject, we are not, on the floor of this Senate, going to lose sight of what is really at stake.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-02-06-pt1-PgS628-2.txt,1247,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017--Continued,2018.0,6.0,February
