           HONORING JAHEIR MOORE FOR SERVICE TO HIS COMMUNITY

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jaheir Moore, a seventh 
grade student from Jersey City, New Jersey, for his service to people 
in need.
  This young man from my district takes the time nearly every day to 
crochet hats, scarves, blankets, and other items for people in homeless 
shelters and newborn babies in intensive care units. Over the past 
couple of years, he has donated dozens of bags full of his creations to 
make life a little better for others.
  Jaheir is a straight A student who wants to become a fashion 
designer. In February, he was a guest on the ``Rachael Ray Show.'' A 
week later, Jaheir had his first runway show in Jersey City. In April, 
I presented him with a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition 
for his charity work.
  Mr. Speaker, Jaheir Moore's unselfish acts of kindness for people in 
need shows that our country's future is a bright one.
