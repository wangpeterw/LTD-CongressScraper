    FIVE MILLIONTH SOLDIER COMPLETES BASIC TRAINING AT FORT JACKSON

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate South 
Carolina's Fort Jackson, as the 5 millionth soldier has just completed 
the Basic Combat Training, BCT, Program.
  Fort Jackson is located in Columbia, SC, and has a deep and proud 
history. For 100 years, Fort Jackson has helped the U.S. Army train and 
fulfill needs for disciplined and skilled soldiers in times of war and 
peace. As the U.S. Army's largest location for BCT, Fort Jackson is 
responsible for training half of the entire Army's BCT population. Fort 
Jackson also provides an array of services outside of BCT, including 
the U.S. Army's Drill Sergeant School and Soldier Support Institute.
  Today I join the citizens of South Carolina in recognizing Fort 
Jackson, the soldiers, civilians, and retirees employed there, and the 
soldiers who have been trained there. I also extend my deepest 
gratitude to these soldiers' families, as they have also served and 
sacrificed for our country. With the completion of each mission, Fort 
Jackson continues to make the Palmetto State and the U.S. Army proud. I 
will always be thankful for Fort Jackson's dedication to protecting our 
great Nation.
