                RUSSIA DECRIMINALIZES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, according to a Russian proverb: ``If 
he beats you, it means he loves you.'' In Russia, that has become the 
norm. Forty percent of all violent crimes in Russia are done within the 
home. 36,000 people are beaten by their partners every day.
  Madam Speaker, this is disturbing; but the Russian Parliament has 
voted overwhelmingly to decriminalize domestic violence if it does not 
cause substantial bodily harm and does not happen more than once a 
year. So, if a husband beats his wife once a year, that is fine, sayeth 
the lords of Siberia.
  Madam Speaker, domestic violence is not just a family issue; it is a 
human rights issue. As a lifelong advocate for victims, our societies 
and countries must recognize the devastating effect of domestic 
violence. It tears at the fabric of society--and not legalize it, but 
stop this nightmare wherever it is.
  Like my grandmother always taught me, you never hurt somebody you 
claim you love.
  And that is just the way it is.
