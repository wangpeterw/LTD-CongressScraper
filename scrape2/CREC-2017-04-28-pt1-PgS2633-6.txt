        CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND COAL MINER HEALTHCARE BENEFITS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, with cooperation from our friends 
across the aisle, the Senate will pass a short-term continuing 
resolution before this evening so Members of both parties can continue 
to work on a longer term solution.
  The legislation should pass today, and it will carry us through next 
week so that a bipartisan final agreement can be reached and so the 
Members will have time to review the legislation before we take it up.
  Importantly, this 1-week extension will ensure that thousands of 
retired coal miners and their families, including many in my home State 
of Kentucky and in the home State of the Acting President pro tempore, 
West Virginia, will not lose their healthcare benefits.
  Protecting these miners and their families from losing their 
healthcare has been a top priority of mine as well as the occupant of 
the Chair. Last year, I fought for a long-term extension of healthcare 
benefits, and earlier this year, I introduced my own bill to provide a 
permanent fix for miners' healthcare. I will continue to fight on their 
behalf to secure a permanent solution on this issue in the larger 
funding bill.
  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
