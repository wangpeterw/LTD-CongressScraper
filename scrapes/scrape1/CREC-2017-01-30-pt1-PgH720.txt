  Mr. SANFORD changed his vote from ``yea'' to ``nay.''
  So (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and 
the bill, as amended, was passed.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.


                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I missed the following 
votes:
  1. H.R. 374, To remove the sunset provision of section 203 of Public 
Law 105-384, and for other purposes. Had I been present, I would have 
voted ``yes'' on this bill.
  2. H.R. 538, Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park Boundary 
Revision Act of 2017, as amended. Had I been present, I would have 
voted ``yes'' on this bill.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, for today's vote series, I was 
unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye'' on 
rollcall 66 and rollcall 67.


                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall Nos. 66 (motion to suspend the 
rules and pass, as amended, H.R. 374), and 67 (motion to suspend the 
rules and pass, as amended, H.R. 538) I did not cast my vote. Had I 
been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on both of the votes.
