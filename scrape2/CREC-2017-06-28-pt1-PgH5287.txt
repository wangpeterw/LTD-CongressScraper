                          personal explanation

  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No. 
334, No. 335, No. 336, No. 337, and No. 338 due to my spouse's health 
situation in California. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' 
on the Hudson Amendment. I would have also voted ``nay'' on the Barr 
Amendment. I would have also voted ``yea'' on the Democratic Motion to 
Recommit H.R. 1215. I would have also voted ``nay'' on the Final 
Passage of H.R. 1215--Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017. I would 
have also voted ``yea'' on H.R. 1500--Robert Emmet Park Act of 2017.
