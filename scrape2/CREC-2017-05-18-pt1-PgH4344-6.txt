                     NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WEEK

  (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the great men and 
women of law enforcement. As you know, it is National Law Enforcement 
Week, first established by President Kennedy in 1962.
  Imagine waking up every morning, rolling out of your bed, rubbing 
your eyes, getting dressed for work, kissing a loved one good-bye for 
what may be the very last time. You walk out your door not even 
thinking about the potential danger that awaits you, not even 
questioning who the person is asking for help, and not hesitating to 
step in the line of fire should you be required to.
  Notice that I said ``you.'' You, a Republican. You, a Democrat. 
Black, White, Brown, gay, or straight, for all types don the uniform 
every day.
  Men and women of law enforcement are a special breed amongst us. 
Theirs is a higher calling for service. They are part of the very 
fabric of our society. Without them, we would not have order, and our 
laws would be worthless.
  For those men and women of law enforcement in Virginia's Second 
District, and those around the Nation, we thank you. Your willingness 
to put the safety of others above your own demands respect, 
recognition, and, for some, remembrance.
