            RECOGNIZING BICENTENNIAL OF PETERSBURG, INDIANA

  (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a notable 
Hoosier milestone, the bicentennial of the city of Petersburg, Indiana. 
Located in Pike County, this southern Indiana community was settled on 
land donated by Peter Brenton in 1817, and was established just 1 year 
later after Indiana had become a State.
  From its earliest days as a pioneer settlement near the Buffalo Trace 
and the White River, Petersburg is today a vibrant commercial and 
residential community and the seat of the county government. Blessed 
with an abundance of natural resources, it is a leader in Indiana's 
power generation industry.
  While rightfully proud of its favorite son, baseball great Gil 
Hodges, Petersburg is squarely focused on a promising future. It boasts 
wonderful, new downtown housing, a new county public library, and just 
dedicated its new fire department. It looks forward to exciting 
development opportunities along I-69.
  I proudly salute the city of Petersburg; its mayor, R.C. Klipsch; and 
its loyal citizens on this historic occasion.
