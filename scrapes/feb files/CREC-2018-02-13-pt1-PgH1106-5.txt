              HONORING FLORIDA'S THIRD DISTRICT OLYMPIANS

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, on February 9, the Winter Olympics began in 
South Korea.
  As we celebrate the world coming together to achieve the very best in 
sports, I am extremely proud and excited to announce that Florida's 
Third District has three young speed skaters, Brittany Bowe, Erin 
Jackson, and Joey Mantia, who are competing in the Olympics.
  Brittany, Erin, and Joey are from the town of Ocala, a city in my 
district with no ice rink. Yet, under the tutelage of Renee Hildebrand, 
these athletes have perfected their skills through regular training on 
roller blades. In fact, Erin had only spent 4 months total training on 
ice before earning her spot, making her position as the first African-
American woman to qualify for the U.S. long track team even more 
remarkable.
  Brittany, Erin, and Joey, all of Florida's Third District is rooting 
for you, and I know you will make our community and the Nation proud.
  Good luck, and go Team USA.
