                                 PRAYER

  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Today's opening prayer will be offered by 
Dr. Andrew Chaney, senior pastor at First and Calvary Presbyterian 
Church from Springfield, MO.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, bless these Senators You have chosen to preserve the 
heritage of America. Bless their families to provide homes of loving 
support and civility so our Senators will govern with hearts filled 
with compassion and service to others. We pray for strength of 
character in our Senate. Fortify weak places that might give way to 
moral compromise. We pray for faithfulness. If they become discouraged, 
may their first instinct be to seek Your light shining in the darkness. 
We pray for spiritual empowerment. If they feel overwhelmed, lead them 
to green pastures. If they feel irritated by noise and busyness, lead 
them beside the still waters. When they feel exhausted, restore their 
souls. We pray for strength and leadership. Give them courage to be 
humble, to forgive, to stand up for what is right. Give them the 
courage to confront injustice. Give them the courage to stand for 
American ideals, the courage to resist temptation, and the courage to 
trust in You with their heart, mind, and soul.
  We pray this in the power of Your Holy Name. Amen.
