                     RECOGNIZING GREENBERG TRAURIG

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Greenberg 
Traurig, an iconic law firm located in my congressional district whose 
growth, over the past 50 years, has been symbolic of the growth of our 
south Florida community.
  In 1967, attorneys Larry Hoffman, Mel Greenberg, and Robert Traurig 
saw an opportunity to capitalize on south Florida's emergence as a 
center of global commerce and joined together to found the law firm 
Greenberg Traurig Hoffman. Over time, these visionaries played an 
important role in defining the south Florida skyline and its corporate 
landscape. Now their firm has expanded across Florida, across our 
country, and even internationally.
  Fifty years after its founding, Greenberg Traurig today has more than 
2,000 attorneys practicing in 38 locations on three continents. With a 
culture strongly rooted in providing legal excellence for clients and 
an unparalleled commitment to community service, Greenberg Traurig 
prospered and grew alongside Miami to the extent that both are now 
global influencers.
  I am truly proud to have Greenberg Traurig, founded in my 
congressional district, as a continued partner in the growth of south 
Florida, and I wish the firm another 50 years of continued success.
