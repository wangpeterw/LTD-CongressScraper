                      GIVING TO CHARITY IS CRUCIAL

  (Mr. WALKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to announce the introduction of 
the Universal Charitable Giving Act. Many Americans believe that 
people, not the government, offer the best solutions to solve the 
ailments that face our society. Strong families, strong churches, and 
strong communities are the foundations of our Nation. By supporting 
charities, we can make our communities and our country a better place 
for Americans from all walks of life.
  Giving to charity is crucial for economic prosperity, happiness, and 
the success of our people, but for too long only the most wealthy have 
been incentivized to give to the causes they believe in.
  The Universal Charitable Giving Act incentivizes charitable giving 
for low- and middle-income taxpayers. It would allow everyone to deduct 
charitable giving, regardless of itemizing status.
  With tax reform, our aim is to increase take-home pay for middle 
America. With my bill, our goal is to increase support for all 
charities.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the great work of our 
faith-based and charitable organizations by supporting this bill.
