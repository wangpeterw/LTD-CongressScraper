  PROTECT THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER'S 
                             INVESTIGATION

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, since before his inauguration last 
year, President Trump, his administration, and its allies have tested 
the independence and credibility of the FBI.
  Since the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller, we have seen these 
efforts grow into an apparent attempt to stymie Special Counsel 
Mueller's investigation and protect the administration from potentially 
being held accountable.
  We have seen several pressure tactics employed from the firing of 
former FBI Director Comey, the ongoing investigation into the FBI's 
investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails, and most recently, reports 
of the President's attempt to fire Special Counsel Mueller himself.
  This is a clear sign that Congress must act to protect the 
independence and integrity of the special counsel's investigation. I 
urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come together in 
protecting the special counsel from baseless termination and ensuring 
that his investigation can follow the facts wherever they may lead.
