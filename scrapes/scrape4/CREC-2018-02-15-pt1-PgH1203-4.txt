                  AMERICAN SCHOOLCHILDREN ARE AT RISK

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this House generally jumps into action once 
there has been a mass shooting by having a moment of silence. Today we 
didn't even have a moment of silence because the House knows that those 
are meaningless acts that don't have any effect on our schoolchildren 
who have been the victims of 18 school mass shootings this year.
  It is shameful this Congress has not dealt with no fly, no buy. If 
you are on a terrorist list, you can still buy a gun.
  It is a shame this Congress passed a law that takes away from 
individuals who get Social Security who may be mentally ill the ability 
to buy a gun.
  We don't even have studies on what has been happening in trying to 
protect schoolchildren. It is a shame.
  We need to act. American schoolchildren are at risk, and I am ashamed 
at what this Congress has failed to do: take action.
