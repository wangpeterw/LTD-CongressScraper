 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize McKenzie Bobbitt, 
an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work she 
has done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past 
several months.
  McKenzie is a graduate of Texas A&M University--Commerce, in 
Commerce, TX, having earned a degree in business administration. She is 
a dedicated worker who has been committed to getting the most out of 
her experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to McKenzie for all of 
the fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the years 
to come.
