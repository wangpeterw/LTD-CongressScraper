                     HONORING OUR NATION'S VETERANS

  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our 
Nation's veterans. I would like to take a moment to thank our Nation's 
heroes for their selfless service to our country.
  It was a privilege to welcome home veterans on the Indy Honor Flight 
last month after they traveled to D.C. to visit memorials honoring 
their service and the sacrifice of our Nation's Armed Forces. It was 
both a humbling and inspiring opportunity to meet so many veterans who 
are patriots in every sense of the word. We owe it to them and their 
families to ensure they have access to quality care and the services 
they deserve.
  I am proud to see many important veterans bills pass through the 
House this week and look forward to continuing our work in Congress to 
support our American heroes.
  To all of our veterans, we thank you for your service, and enjoy 
Veterans Day. We salute you.
