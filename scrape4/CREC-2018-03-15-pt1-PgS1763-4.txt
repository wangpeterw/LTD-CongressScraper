                         TRIBUTE TO KELLI LOHR

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of 
recognizing Kelli Lohr, the new owner of the Prairie Peddler in Shelby. 
The Prairie Peddler has been a community business for over two decades. 
Families throughout the years have come to indulge in scones, cookies 
and coffee, and shop for household decor and gifts.
  When Kelli saw that the notable community establishment may close 
without a new owner, she stepped up without any prior experience as a 
businessowner and took a chance. Working together with the former owner 
to make a smooth transition, Kelli was able to ensure that the 
community's favorite staples would still be available as she stocked 
the shelves with new and exciting items as well. Her work has paid off. 
The family business is growing as folks have more money in their 
paychecks following the recent tax cuts and the community is eager to 
support the new management.
  Thank you, Kelli, and the rest of the Lohr family. Your dedication to 
maintaining a community business is appreciated by the people of Toole 
County and the surrounding area. It is businesses like yours that make 
Montana the ``Last Best Place.''
