                     NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the House Paper and 
Packaging Caucus, I rise today to recognize the 57th anniversary of 
National Forest Products Week.
  As an Oregonian, this week takes on special significance for me and 
my constituents. Oregon is home to over 174 wood products, paper, and 
packaging manufacturing facilities that make nearly $11 billion in 
products annually and contribute over $2 billion to the State and local 
economies through wages and compensation.
  I would like to recognize and thank the nearly 38,000 hardworking men 
and women employed by the forest products industry in my State. Your 
contributions to our State and your local communities are greatly 
appreciated.
  In this country, we are fortunate to have the renewable natural 
resources and domestic manufacturing to be able to provide Americans 
with the paper or packaging tissue and wood products that are central 
to modern life and the modern economy.
  I want to thank and congratulate the people and employees in the 
forest products industry for the valuable role they play in the economy 
not only in my State and district, but to rural communities across this 
country.
