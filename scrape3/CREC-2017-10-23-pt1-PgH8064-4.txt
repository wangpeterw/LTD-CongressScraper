  HONORING THE LIFE OF FALLEN HERO, SERGEANT LA DAVID TERRENCE JOHNSON

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, it is with my deepest sympathy that I 
rise today to recognize the tragic loss of Sergeant La David Terrence 
Johnson, one of four brave U.S. Special Forces soldiers--and you see 
them here listed--killed during an ambush in Niger on October 4 as a 
result of enemy fire.
  Sergeant Johnson was a proud south Floridian, a decorated soldier, 
having been awarded several honors, and well-loved throughout our 
community.
  Sergeant Johnson was a loving husband to his wife, Myeshia, and a 
devoted father to their wonderful children, Ah'Leeysa Jones and La 
David Johnson, Jr. He leaves behind a baby girl due in January.
  Sergeant Johnson will always be remembered as a loyal family man, a 
dedicated soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.
  I offer my deepest sympathy to Sergeant Johnson's mourning family, 
friends, and loved ones.
  Godspeed to Sergeant La David Terrence Johnson.
