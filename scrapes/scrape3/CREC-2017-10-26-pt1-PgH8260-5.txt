                  LET'S WORK ON BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow the Republican majority to 
trade away creating jobs here in America for doling out massive tax 
breaks to wealthy corporations that have no intention of investing here 
in the United States of America. The Republican plan will actually fuel 
more job outsourcing and move benefits to shareholders and overpaid 
CEOs, not the workers of our country.
  We can't allow Republicans to cut education, cut Medicare, cut Social 
Security, cut Medicaid, which serve the elderly and the ill. Eighty 
percent of the tax giveaways in their plan go to the top 1 percent.
  Untargeted tax cuts don't create jobs. In fact, when Congress, during 
the 1980s, passed a tax cut, companies couldn't outsource middle class 
jobs fast enough. It was a bad deal then, and it is a bad deal now.
  Our country can't afford to balloon the deficit by $1.5 trillion so 
Wall Street can appease their shareholders a little more and stack the 
decks against American workers. Tax reform should not result in the 
outsourcing of our jobs. It should result in investing here in the 
United States of America, and that begins with real tax reform, not 
scam tax reform.
