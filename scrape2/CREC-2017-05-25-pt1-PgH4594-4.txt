  UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNIVERSITY 
                             WITHOUT WALLS

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 45th 
anniversary of the University of Massachusetts Amherst University 
Without Walls, one of the oldest and most highly regarded adult 
bachelor's degree completion programs in the Nation.
  Founded in 1971, UWW provides nontraditional students with access to 
the resources of our best universities. It has developed into a 
national leader in adult education, having graduated nearly 4,300 
students, including basketball legend, Julius Erving.
  One of the first programs in the Nation to offer an innovative blend 
of online and classroom learning, UWW provides an excellent education 
to students, including many veterans who are unable to complete a 
traditional college degree due to financial constraints, family 
obligations, or personal hardship.
  The key to success is the incredible team of UMass Amherst faculty 
and staff who have dedicated their lives to teaching and supporting 
adult students as they balance family, community, and academic 
responsibilities.
  I wish to personally thank all of the faculty, staff, and UWW 
students for their dedication to excellence.
