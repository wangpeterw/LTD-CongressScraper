               CBO ANALYSIS ESPECIALLY BAD NEWS FOR WOMEN

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today the House 
Budget Committee passed the Republican healthcare plan.
  We all know by now that the recent CBO analysis has some very bad 
news for millions of Americans, but it has some especially bad news for 
women. The GOP plan makes Planned Parenthood ineligible for any 
reimbursement from Medicaid or Medicare for one entire year. More than 
half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically 
underserved areas. Even in my district in New York, women are lined up 
outside the building and down the block, often waiting for Planned 
Parenthood services.
  Yet, the CBO says that if the GOP plan becomes law, more than 15 
percent of low-income women in our country will be without any access 
to health care--no cancer screenings and no tests and treatments for 
STDs. Women's lives and well-being should have greater value than this, 
but they just don't seem to count in the cruel math of this merciless 
law.
