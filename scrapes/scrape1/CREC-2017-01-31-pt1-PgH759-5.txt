            NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST--A WONDERFUL TRADITION

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, on Thursday, Members of 
Congress and leaders from across the globe will gather in Washington, 
D.C., to mark one of our finest traditions: the National Prayer 
Breakfast.
  This event is hosted annually on the first Thursday in February. More 
than 3,000 people typically gather for this international forum that 
allows individuals from various sectors--including political, business, 
and social--to build relationships and come together in faith, 
fellowship, and prayer.
  Personally, I look forward to the National Prayer Breakfast each year 
as a time when thousands around the world and right here at home can 
reflect on their faith, focus on the year ahead, and walk away from 
this remarkable

event with a renewed sense of hope and faith.
  This nonpartisan event brings together so many unique individuals who 
will hear the stories of inspiration from faith-filled speakers.
  From the Book of First Chronicles, Scripture tells us to, ``Look to 
the Lord and His strength; seek His face always.'' This is what we will 
be seeking at the National Prayer Breakfast.
  It is my hope that I will see many of my colleagues there this 
Thursday.
