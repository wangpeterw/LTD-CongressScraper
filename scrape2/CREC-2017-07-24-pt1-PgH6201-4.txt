                                MEDICAID

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, within hours, the Senate will begin a 
sinister unraveling of the safety net for millions of Americans--$774 
billion cut from Medicaid--and they will throw on the ground some $200 
billion that is just a bait to be able to bring votes in.
  It was sad to see the administration speak today about having people 
lose their lives because, without healthcare, they will. I ask the 
Senate to vote ``no.'' Kill this bill.
  It would be important if the President would also have an agenda--6 
months and he has no jobs bill, no insurance, and no infrastructure 
bill.
  I hope also to restore constitutional integrity, and I expect to 
introduce legislation dealing with preventing the President from firing 
the special counsel and from abusing the pardon power to pardon people 
who are under investigation.
  I ask that we work together, and that is to save lives. Vote ``no'' 
on that Senate bill.
