  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge a distinguished Philadelphian who will be leading our 
city's annual St. Patrick's Day parade as grand marshal, Sister Mary 
Scullion.
  Sister Mary is a towering figure and a driving force for social 
change in Philadelphia. She belongs to the Sisters of Mercy, the third 
largest congregation of Sisters in Philadelphia, and is the cofounder 
of Project HOME, an influential nonprofit that seeks to break the cycle 
of homelessness.
  Since 1989, Sister Mary's organization has helped provide shelter to 
the homeless, set up programs for at-risk youth across the city, and 
organized wellness and healthcare services. She has also been a leader 
at the city, State, and Federal level to bring about awareness and 
much-needed funding to address the root causes of homelessness.
  As a religious and community leader, Sister Mary has become a 
household

name in Philadelphia and a champion for the voiceless in our city. It 
is fitting that she has been selected to lead this year's St. Patrick's 
Day parade, and I rise to commend her on her lifetime of devoted 
service.
