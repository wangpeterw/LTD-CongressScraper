            CELEBRATING THE ELIZABETH TAYLOR AIDS FOUNDATION

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate The 
Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation for its efforts and commitment to 
transform the lives for those living with HIV/AIDS.
  Since its creation in 1991, this foundation has advanced Elizabeth 
Taylor's dream to create a future free of HIV/AIDS by supporting 
organizations delivering care and services for people living with this 
disease.
  Today, the Foundation remains a leading player in the fight to end 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic by providing grants to global programs that seek 
to fund education, to raise awareness, and to create innovative 
treatments for patients.
  As the co-chair of the Congressional HIV/AIDS Caucus, I have had the 
opportunity to work with this foundation over the years to help improve 
the lives of patients and advance research efforts that can lead to a 
cure for this terrible disease.
  I celebrate The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, and I look forward 
to continuing to work with it to realize our common dream of an AIDS-
free generation in the U.S. and, indeed, throughout the world.
