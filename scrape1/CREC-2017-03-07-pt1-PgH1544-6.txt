                    HONORING MADILYN GAWRYCH-TURNER

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a bright young 
constituent from my district in southern Illinois on winning a 
scholarship in the VFW Patriot's Pen essay competition.
  Enacted in 1995, the Patriot's Pen program is designed to foster 
patriotism by allowing students the opportunity to express their 
opinion on patriotic themes. This year's theme was ``The America I 
Believe In.''
  Madilyn Gawrych-Turner of Jonesboro Elementary School in Jonesboro, 
Illinois, was sponsored by the VFW post in Anna, Illinois. I would like 
to congratulate Madilyn, and I know she will have a very bright future.
  Also, Madam Speaker, I would like to take just a second, if I may, to 
wish my wife a happy anniversary for the 37 years that we have been 
together.
