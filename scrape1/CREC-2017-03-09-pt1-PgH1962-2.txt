                        TRUMPCARE IS A DISASTER

  (Mr. TED LIEU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose TrumpCare. 
This legislation is a ``bigly'' disaster. TrumpCare will cause 
Americans to pay more for less health insurance coverage. It doesn't 
just affect the 20 million people who are now at threat of losing their 
health insurance. It affects all 156 million Americans under employer-
based health coverage whose premiums will now increase because of the 
chaos that TrumpCare is causing in the health insurance markets.
  I agree with Republican Senator Tom Cotton about once every 3 years. 
This is one of those times. We both agree that TrumpCare is a disaster 
and that the House Republicans need to start over.
