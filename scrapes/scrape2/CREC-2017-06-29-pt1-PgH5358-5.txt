              THE SENATE'S BETTER CARE RECONCILIATION ACT

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, this week, it was confirmed that the 
Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act is not just mean, it can't even 
be passed by the majority party.
  The nonpartisan CBO revealed that if that bill did pass, in our 
Nation, 22 million people would lose their healthcare coverage over the 
next 10 years. That means in my district, on the central coast of 
California, 49,000 people would lose their insurance, and 16,000 people 
would lose their coverage they gained due to the Affordable Care Act.
  So because of that score, the Senate couldn't pass the bill, and they 
delayed the vote on it. So now, we have the time. So now, let's slow 
down. Let's do something the American people are yearning for. Let's 
come together, Republicans and Democrats, not just to repair our 
Nation's healthcare, but to find bipartisan solutions for what is best 
for all of our constituents and all of our communities for healthcare 
all across our country.
