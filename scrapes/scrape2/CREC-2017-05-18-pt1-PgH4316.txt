                  RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Bost) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, every day law enforcement officers around this 
country protect our families from harm and keep peace and promote the 
cause of justice. As a former first responder myself, I am proud to 
support these heroes, especially those who have paid the ultimate price 
to keep our families safe.
  National Police Week is a good reminder that we need to show support 
and appreciation to those who serve and protect us. We set aside this 
week each year to honor the call to service and profound commitment to 
duty embodied in our law enforcement officers--both in southern 
Illinois and across this Nation.
  I join with the grateful communities around the Nation to thank our 
officers and honor those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the 
line of duty. We pray for them and we pray for their families as they 
watch over us.
