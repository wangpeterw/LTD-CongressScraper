    SENATE RESOLUTION 306--RECOGNIZING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2017 AS 
                     ``NATIONAL PRINCIPALS MONTH''

  Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Wicker) submitted the 
following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 306

       Whereas the National Association of Secondary School 
     Principals, the National Association of Elementary School 
     Principals, and the American Federation of School 
     Administrators have declared the month of October 2017 to be 
     ``National Principals Month'';
       Whereas principals are educational visionaries, 
     instructional and assessment leaders, disciplinarians, 
     community builders, budget analysts, facilities managers, and 
     administrators of legal and contractual obligations;
       Whereas principals work collaboratively with teachers and 
     parents to develop and implement a clear mission, high 
     curriculum standards, and performance goals;
       Whereas principals create school environments that 
     facilitate great teaching and learning and continuous school 
     improvement;
       Whereas the vision, actions, and dedication of principals 
     provide the mobilizing force behind any school reform effort; 
     and
       Whereas the celebration of National Principals Month would 
     honor elementary school, middle school, and high school 
     principals, and recognize the importance of principals in 
     ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality 
     education: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes the month of October 2017 as ``National 
     Principals Month''; and
       (2) honors the contribution of principals in the elementary 
     schools, middle schools, and high schools of the United 
     States by supporting the goals and ideals of National 
     Principals Month.
