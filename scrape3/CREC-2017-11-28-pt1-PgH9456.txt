               HONORING THE WISHES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, recently, I met with a group of engineering 
and nursing students from Rutgers University. These young people have 
worked hard to get an education so they can help communities in need, 
but they came to the Nation's Capital asking for help that only 
Congress can provide.
  These bright young minds are not U.S. citizens; they are what we call 
DREAMers. Each day that passes without Congress voting on the Dream Act 
darkens their futures. Like the 20,000 other DREAMers in my district, 
these are young people who fear that they will be detained and deported 
to places they have never seen or known before.
  Mr. Speaker, the holiday season is supposed to be a time of joy and 
celebration, not fear and uncertainty. I implore my colleagues to honor 
the wishes of the American people and do the right thing by history. 
Let us finally pass the Dream Act.
