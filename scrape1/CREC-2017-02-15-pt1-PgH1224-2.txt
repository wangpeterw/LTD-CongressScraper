                 SEATTLE'S DIVESTMENT FROM WELLS FARGO

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my hometown, the 
city of Seattle, on its historic decision to terminate its $3 billion 
relationship with Wells Fargo Bank over its financing and support of 
the Dakota Access pipeline.
  Last week, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to divest from 
Wells Fargo, making it the first major city to do so.
  Led by Native American and environmental activists, our city made an 
important statement about the vision that we have for our community and 
for our world. That vision centralizes both the rights of our native 
brothers and sisters, and our environment.
  Just like it did with the $15 minimum wage, Seattle continues to be a 
leader and a model for the rest of the country, and activists and 
cities around the United States have picked up the torch.
  We stand united in prioritizing our environment, as it is deeply 
connected to the health of our communities. Rather than allowing 
dangerous pipeline projects to continue, putting millions of people at 
risk, we should be focused on being leaders in the international fight 
against climate change.
  I am committed, Mr. Speaker, to taking every opportunity to protect 
our resources and fight for a bold alternative energy plan that 
includes a just transition that creates great union jobs and puts us on 
a sustainable path forward.
