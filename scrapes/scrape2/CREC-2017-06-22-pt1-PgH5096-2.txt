                  JUNE IS NATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP MONTH

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize June as National Homeownership Month and to introduce three 
bills to protect homeowners: the Foreclosure Fairness Act, the National 
Homeowners Bill of Rights Act, and the Keeping Families Home Act.
  In 2016, the homeownership rate in the U.S. fell to 62.9 percent, the 
lowest rate since 1967. Before the Great Recession, it peaked at about 
nearly 70 percent.
  Unfortunately, in the past 8 years, New Mexico, my home State, has 
not seen economic recovery. In fact, as of April 2017, New Mexico's 
foreclosure rate is 40 percent higher than the national average.
  Owning a home is not only the American Dream, it also increases 
economic activity as well as wealth for the owners. The average 
homeowner has a net worth that is 36 times that of the average renter--
$195,400 compared to $5,400.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my bills, which will 
make the foreclosure process more transparent and fair, prohibit 
deficiency judgments, help non-English speakers communicate with 
mortgage servicers, and keep families in their home.
