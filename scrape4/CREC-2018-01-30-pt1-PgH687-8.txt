                        AMERICANS ARE BETTER OFF

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the differences are stark between 
President Obama's first year in office and President Trump's first year 
in office. If you just listen to the liberal media, you would think our 
country is worse off under President Trump. However, if you follow the 
facts, Americans are far better off.

  In 2009, 4 million jobs were lost. In 2017, 1.7 million jobs were 
created.
  Gross domestic product in President Obama's first year went down 2.8 
percent. It was up 2.3 percent last year.
  Unemployment in 2009 increased from 7.8 percent to 9.9 percent. It 
fell in 2017 from 4.8 percent to 4.1 percent, a 17-year low.
  The Standard & Poor's stock market index was at 1,115 President 
Obama's first year. It recently hit 2,673.
  President Trump's policies are helping more Americans get back to 
work, pay less in taxes, and build their retirement and savings 
accounts. These are the facts.
  Mr. Speaker, Americans can accurately say they are better off today 
than they were 8 years ago, or even 1 year ago.
