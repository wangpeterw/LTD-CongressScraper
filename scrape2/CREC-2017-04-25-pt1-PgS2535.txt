SENATE RESOLUTION 143--SUPPORTING FAIR AND EQUITABLE GRADING TREATMENT 
         FOR EXPORTS OF UNITED STATES WHEAT PRODUCTS TO CANADA

  Mr. TESTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Finance:

                              S. Res. 143

       Whereas Canada is the second-largest goods trading partner 
     of the United States, with $575,000,000,000 in goods traded 
     between the 2 countries in 2015, as the United States 
     exported $280,000,000,000 in goods to Canada and imported 
     $295,000,000,000 in goods from Canada in that year;
       Whereas the efficient and equitable flow of agricultural 
     goods across the border is a critical component of the trade 
     relationship between the United States and Canada;
       Whereas wheat is the third-most widely produced field crop 
     in the United States, and approximately \1/2\ of the wheat 
     produced in the United States is exported;
       Whereas Canadian law requires wheat imported from the 
     United States to be segregated from wheat produced in Canada 
     and automatically designated as feed quality, the lowest 
     possible designation, regardless of the actual quality or the 
     variety of the wheat product;
       Whereas United States Federal law allows wheat imported 
     from Canada to be graded under the same system as 
     domestically grown wheat;
       Whereas that unfair devaluation practice puts United States 
     agricultural producers at a distinct disadvantage when 
     attempting to access Canadian wheat markets;
       Whereas the treatment by Canada of United States wheat 
     products is likely a violation of trade agreements and is to 
     the detriment of United States agricultural producers; and
       Whereas the strong economic ties between the United States 
     and Canada are extremely important and well-served when a 
     level playing field exists across all industries: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
       (1) wheat grading practices in Canada should--
       (A) grade wheat produced in Canada in the same manner as 
     wheat produced in the United States; and
       (B) be fair to agricultural producers in the United States; 
     and
       (2) the President should--
       (A) examine whether the wheat grading laws of Canada adhere 
     to trade agreements; and
       (B) insist on full access for United States exporters of 
     wheat to the Canadian market.
