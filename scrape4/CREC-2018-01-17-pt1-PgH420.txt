                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Lord God, architect of the universe and advocate for us all, thank 
You for giving us another day.
  When we rise from sleep, activities of the day stir the mind. Having 
a job to fulfill sets us into routine as a people with purpose.
  Daily work, O Lord, invites us to demonstrate responsibility and 
manifests our participation in Your creative power. Mind and body 
together become engaged in productivity, sustenance, or service beyond 
ourselves.
  Because human work bestows a special dignity upon a person and is a 
way to achieve a just society, we know how important it is for us to 
pray for the unemployed and those who work but still struggle to make 
ends meet.
  Bless the work of Congress today. May this chosen labor be creative, 
prove responsible, and have lasting results to the benefit of our 
Nation. And may all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
