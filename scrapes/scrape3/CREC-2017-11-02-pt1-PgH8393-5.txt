                          AND THE FANS GO WILD

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is game seven of the World Series. 
Best hitting team in baseball, the Houston Astros Orange, vs. the best 
pitching team in baseball, the LA Dodgers Blue. The series is tied up 
three games apiece.
  Top of the second inning, Springer is at the plate. It is the third 
pitch. Springer loads up and belts it. Home run. Springer smacks his 
fifth round tripper of the World Series. The Astros are up 5-0.
  Next inning--next several innings--all the bats are silent, except 
LA, the best record team in baseball, gets a run.
  It is the bottom of the ninth. The Astros take the field. Score: 5-1. 
One out. Two outs. Houston pitcher Morton sends a sinker straight 
across the plate. It is a ground ball. Three outs.
  It is all over but the shouting. Astros win! Astros win! Astros win! 
World Series Champions of 2017.
  The championship predicted in 2014 by ``Sports Illustrated'' with 
Springer on the cover finally happens after 55 years.
  And the city of Houston goes ASTRO-nomical.
  And that is just the way it is.
