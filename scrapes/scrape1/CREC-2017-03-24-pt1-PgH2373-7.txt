                  HEALTHCARE BILL OUGHT TO BE REJECTED

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, well, here we are. Today is the day when 
this House will vote on whether or not access to health care is a 
fundamental right in this country or should be limited to those of 
means who can afford it, whether access to lifesaving preventative care 
is something that Americans ought to be able to depend upon.
  Now, we haven't seen the final language of the bill--it is still 
being worked on--although we are voting on it today, but here is what 
we know:
  It will result in higher costs.
  It will force families to pay higher premiums and higher out-of-
pocket costs.
  It will provide less coverage; and, in fact, just in the last couple 
of days,

even less coverage, by eliminating essential health benefits like 
preventative care, like hospitalization, like prescription drugs. 
Somebody might have a healthcare card, but it won't provide them health 
care when they need it.
  It will have a crushing age tax. If you are 50 to 64 years of age, 
get ready. You will pay enormously higher costs as a result of this 
ill-conceived piece of legislation.
  This steals from Medicare, undoes the promise.
  This is a bad piece of legislation. It ought to be rejected.
