                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gene Hemrick, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Lord, spring is a time of renewed life. We pray You bless our 
Congress with that which is the heart of life: divine wisdom, 
understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, awe, and reverence of 
Your creatures and creation.
  May these gifts accompany them in their endeavors to form a unified, 
strong Nation.
  Amen.
