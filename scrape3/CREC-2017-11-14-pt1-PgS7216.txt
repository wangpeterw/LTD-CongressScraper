  Mr. BLUNT (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Wicker, Ms. Collins, Mr. 
Enzi, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Moran, Mr. Risch, Mr. Grassley, Mr. 
Roberts, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Daines, Mr. Graham, Mrs. Ernst, Mr. Barrasso, 
Mr. McCain, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Scott, Mr. Portman, Mr. 
Inhofe, Mr. Peters, Mr. Markey, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Casey, Ms. Hassan, Mrs. 
Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Rounds) submitted the 
following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 331

       Whereas there are millions of unparented children in the 
     world, including 427,910 children in the foster care system 
     in the United States, approximately 111,820 of whom are 
     waiting for families to adopt them;
       Whereas 62 percent of the children in foster care in the 
     United States are age 10 or younger;
       Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster 
     care is approximately 2 years;
       Whereas, for many foster children, the wait for a loving 
     family in which the children are nurtured, comforted, and 
     protected seems endless;
       Whereas, in 2015, over 20,000 youth ``aged out'' of foster 
     care by reaching adulthood without being placed in a 
     permanent home;
       Whereas, every day, loving and nurturing families are 
     strengthened and expanded when committed and dedicated 
     individuals make an important difference in the life of a 
     child through adoption;
       Whereas, while nearly a quarter of individuals in the 
     United States have considered adoption, a majority of 
     individuals in the United States have misperceptions about 
     the process of adopting children from foster care and the 
     children who are eligible for adoption;
       Whereas 50 percent of individuals in the United States 
     believe that children enter the foster care system because of 
     juvenile delinquency, when in reality the vast majority of 
     children who have entered the foster care system were victims 
     of neglect, abandonment, or abuse;
       Whereas 39 percent of individuals in the United States 
     believe that foster care adoption is expensive, when in 
     reality there is no substantial cost for adopting from foster 
     care and financial support is available to

     adoptive parents after an adoption is finalized;
       Whereas family reunification, kinship care, and domestic 
     and intercountry adoption promote permanency and stability to 
     a far greater degree than long-term institutionalization or 
     long-term, often disrupted, foster care;
       Whereas November is National Adoption Month, and National 
     Adoption Day occurs in November;
       Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national 
     effort to find permanent, loving families for children in the 
     foster care system;
       Whereas, since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, 
     more than 60,000 children have joined permanent families on 
     National Adoption Day; and
       Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual 
     proclamation to declare the month of November as National 
     Adoption Month, and National Adoption Day is on November 18, 
     2017: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day 
     and National Adoption Month;
       (2) recognizes that every child should have a permanent and 
     loving family; and
       (3) encourages the people of the United States to consider 
     adoption during the month of November and throughout the 
     year.
