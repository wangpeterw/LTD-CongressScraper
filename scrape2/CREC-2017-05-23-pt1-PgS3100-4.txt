                           MANCHESTER ATTACK

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I offer my 
condolences to the families and friends of those who were killed or 
injured in last night's despicable attack at a concert in Manchester, 
England. Details are still coming in, but this looks like an act of 
terror in the heart of one of our key European allies. America is 
joining with the people of Great Britain in expressing our sorrow and 
sadness over the loss of these lives and the injuries that were 
sustained.
