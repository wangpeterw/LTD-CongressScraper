                WELCOMING REVEREND LONNIE MITCHELL, SR.

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
McMorris Rodgers) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to welcome Pastor 
Lonnie Mitchell today to the people's House. He accepted the call to 
ministry in 1985 under the AME church and came to Spokane, Washington, 
in 1991. He moved his young family and has been there ever since, 
leading his congregation under the theme to be ``the cathedral of love, 
where everybody is somebody and Jesus is the center of attraction.''
  He also started the AHANA Business and Professional Organization, 
which was formed for persons of color. He started Unity in the 
Community in Spokane, which is now the largest multicultural 
celebration in the inland Northwest, 22 years strong. He has his 
master's from Gonzaga University, which is our local Jesuit university, 
but is a proponent of bringing faith and government together to build 
and sustain healthy communities.
  It was great to have him here today.
