                                 ______
                                 

   SENATE RESOLUTION 312--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF 
     SEPTEMBER 2017 AND 2018 EACH AS ``NATIONAL MONTH FOR RENTERS''

  Mr. CASSIDY (for himself and Mr. Van Hollen) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 312

       Whereas rental housing is a vital component of the housing 
     market of the United States, providing a place to live for 
     nearly 44,000,000 households and more than 111,000,000 
     individuals in the United States;
       Whereas the number of households renting homes increased by 
     9,000,000 over the past decade, the largest 10-year gain on 
     record;
       Whereas more than 11,000,000 households in communities 
     across the United States spend more than 50 percent of their 
     income on rent and utilities, making those households 
     severely cost-burdened under Federal standards; and
       Whereas those 11,000,000 severely cost-burdened households 
     include 14,000,000 women, 8,000,000 children, 9,000,000 
     members of the Millennial Generation, 2,000,000 senior 
     citizens, and nearly 800,000 veterans: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of September 2017 and 2018 
     each as ``National Month for Renters'' to draw attention to 
     the rental housing shortage in the United States;
       (2) urges a truly national effort involving all levels of 
     government, the private sector, and the philanthropic 
     community to expand the supply of rental homes affordable to 
     low- and moderate-income households;
       (3) recognizes that subsidized rental housing programs 
     implemented by the Federal Government only serve \1/4\ of 
     eligible renters and so are the equivalent of a lottery; and
       (4) recognizes that expanding the supply of rental homes 
     affordable to low- and moderate-income families, particularly 
     when close to employment opportunities, will--
       (A) help reduce commuting costs;
       (B) restore the first rungs of the housing ladder;
       (C) stabilize families and communities;
       (D) promote equality of opportunity; and
       (E) support greater economic growth and prosperity.
