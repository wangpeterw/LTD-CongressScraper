                  FIXING OUR BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

  (Mr. FLEISCHMANN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because ObamaCare has 
failed the American people; and one of its biggest failures is that, 
instead of lowering costs, healthcare prices have increased. Americans 
are paying more for coverage, and families are hurting.
  In my State of Tennessee, premiums are rising by an average of 63 
percent. Why pay so much for health insurance if you still can't afford 
to see a doctor? It puts us right back where we started. And no one--no 
one--thought the status quo before ObamaCare was good enough.
  I am glad to see the American Health Care Act was released, and I 
look forward to working on specific legislative details with my 
colleagues so that we can finally fix our broken healthcare system.
