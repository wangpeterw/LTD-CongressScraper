               WELCOMING PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN TO AMERICA

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in welcoming President Moon 
Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the United States of America.
  Next week will mark his first official visit to Washington, D.C., 
since he assumed the Presidency of his country. This represents a 
continuation of the friendship between our two nations.
  This October will mark the 64th anniversary of the mutual defense 
treaty between our two countries. This landmark legislation continues 
to be a vital component to peace and security in the Asia-Pacific 
region.
  Once again, I look forward to welcoming President Moon Jae-in to the 
United States, and I look forward to continuing our partnership with 
the Republic of Korea.
