                             STOP THE BLEED

  (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I rise today to 
raise awareness about the value of comprehensive training aimed at 
preventing deaths after a traumatic injury occurs.
  Last fall, I took part in a ``Stop the Bleeding'' training course 
offered by the American College of Surgeons. This simple training 
teaches individuals how to treat bleeding injuries and help save a 
life.
  Each year, more than 180,000 people die from traumatic injuries. The 
most common and easily preventable cause of these deaths is too much 
blood loss in the critical minutes before trained first responders 
arrive. With an average response time of 8 to 12 minutes once 911 is 
called, it is the responsibility for all of us to prepare to help 
others in the event of a traumatic injury.
  I look forward to working with my fellow Members of Congress and 
advocates, such as my friends of the American College of Surgeons, to 
raise awareness of the value of this lifesaving technique.
