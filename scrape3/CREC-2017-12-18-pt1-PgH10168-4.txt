                CONGRATULATING SHASTA HIGH SCHOOL WOLVES

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to offer a hearty 
congratulations to the Shasta High School Wolves of Redding, 
California, for their football championship this year. They won the 
north section. They won the Northern California Championship and made 
their first ever visit to the California State Championship, where they 
played down in southern California over the weekend.
  Though they came up a little bit short, they did have an early lead 
in that game after all that travel. So, indeed, congratulations to that 
program at Shasta High School and to the Wolves of Redding, California.
  It is teamwork that really makes this happen, and that is exemplified 
by the north State's leading rusher, Vince Smith, when he was quoted: 
``The thing that was different about this season was that we actually 
really cared about each other and we were family. Every play, we'd use 
our hearts and fight for each other.''
  That is teamwork. That is the spirit. Congratulations, Shasta High 
School Wolves.
