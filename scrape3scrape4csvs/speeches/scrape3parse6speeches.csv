248,topic-id,790,"Mr.Speaker, I have a map beside me. It is not a Verizon or an AT&T map showing its coverage. What this is is a snapshot, a moment in time, of the number of airplanes in the United States' airspace at any moment, over 90,000 flights a day. Think about that. That is over 200,000 takeoffs and landings.  We, in the United States, have the safest and the busiest airspace in the world; yet there are some in Congress who want to privatize this to a board made up of 13 members only. I personally think it is more of a monopolization, not a privatization of our airspace.  This is the taxpayers' airspace. This is not the airspace that we should be giving away to a 13-member board, or the control of.  Those who want to pass this AIRR Act, H.2997, want us to compare it to Well, I have flown in Look at the map: below the line in the United States, above the line in It is not even apples to apples. It is not apples to oranges. It is apples to elephants.  And you say, well, that makes no sense. No, it doesn't. It does not make any sense to give control of this airspace, where our wonderful men in uniform and women who fly the military aircraft, the pilots like myself, but, more importantly, the carriers that carry all of us to here and there, the ability to control this airspace.  I am a small-government guy, Mr.Speaker, but there are three instances where government needs to be involved in the lives of our citizens: national defense, national intelligence, and national airspace.  I would argue that I have probably been in more control towers than any Member of Congress, and when you walk in, there are wonderful controllers who are looking at modern equipment, computer screens, display lights, who are moving aircraft here and there, very efficiently, very professionally.  There are those who have stood at this podium, Mr.Speaker, and held up pieces of paper like this and have scared our people into saying: Oh, this is the way controllers transfer control of airplanes from airspace to airspace.  That is a gross mischaracterization of what is happening. They use this as a backup if a grid goes down, but they don't use it to move traffic. They use modern computers.  The NextGen, or what we call the next generation of modernization of FAA, is called ADS-B, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-It allows separation of aircraft to come down. It has saved billions--that is with a B--in fuel and other costs, and yet we want to give all this modern equipment to the control of a 13-member board? I think not.  We have all had delays in airports. Most of them, I will tell you, are weather. But how many of us have pulled up in a plane and we are waiting for another plane to back out of a gate? That is not an air traffic control issue. That is an issue with controlling the gates at the airport, and that goes back to the airlines.  How many of us have been delayed because they come on and when we are just fixing to board the plane, oh, you have a maintenance issue, or we are waiting for another pilot crew to get off one aircraft to pilot your aircraft? Again, those who would want to pass this act would make you believe that that is air traffic control's fault. No, it does not have to do with air traffic control.  CBO has said that if we give this airspace control to a 13-member private board, it will cause a $100 billion deficit addition--$100 billion. The Congressional Review Service has said that if we do that, that automatically allows sequester to take place. We don't need that. We are trying to get out of that now. Our wonderful men and women in uniform are having a hard enough time meeting quotas, meeting equipment, meeting training, everything, because of the sequester.  This would hurt military retirement funding. This would hurt our Border Patrol, men and women there protecting us from terrorist activity on a daily basis.  Mr.Speaker, we need modernization, but we don't need privatization. It is a bad idea any way you look at it.  We do need to pass a long-term FAA reauthorization act. I am all for that. Our FAA needs to have the stability of funding where they can look down the road more than 6 months at a time and plan for what is coming down and what they need to do to keep our airspace safe.  So, Mr.Speaker, we don't need this H.2997 passed. We need just to fund FAA for a long time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8303.txt,2244,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017,1,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

141,topic-id,415,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the article, ``More ACA Plans to Come With No Premiums in 2018,'' by Anna Wilde Mathews and Christopher Weaver that was published in the Wall Street Journal on October 27, 2017.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            More ACA Plans To Come With No Premiums in 2018       Insurers selling Affordable Care Act plans have a      compelling new pitch: free health insurance.       When sales of plans on the law's exchanges begin 1, a      growing number of consumers around the country will be able      to get coverage for 2018 without paying any monthly premium,      according to health insurers and an analysis of newly      available federal data.       In nearly all of the 2,722 counties included in the data,      some consumers will be able to obtain free health insurance      because they qualify for larger federal premium subsidies      that cover the full cost of a plan, according to the new      analysis.       The growing availability of no-premium plans is a side      effect of a decision by President Donald Trump's      administration to end federal payments that are used to      reduce out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles, for low-     income enrollees. The administration didn't halt--and      indirectly bolstered--the federal subsidies that help      consumers with their insurance premiums.       The new analysis doesn't project exactly how many consumers      could be eligible for the no-premium plans, a figure that      depends on variables including people's income, household      size, age, location and access to other types of health      coverage.       In the coming weeks, insurers are gearing up to promote the      no-premium option. Amid uncertainty about the future of the      2010 health law, known as Obamacare, many insurers have      pulled back from the law's marketplaces. Many of the      remaining ones are worried about losing enrollment next      year--largely among consumers who aren't eligible for      subsidies and won't be able to get premium-free plans.       Insurers hope the no-premium insurance draws in more      enrollees, particularly those they need most: people with few      health needs. Healthy consumers help bolster the stability of      the market by balancing out the health costs of sicker      enrollees.       ``We absolutely will be promoting this opportunity to get      coverage at a zero price,''[[Page S6998]]     said Wendy Curran, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield      of Wyoming, which is mentioning the no-premium plans in      print, radio and social-media advertising. ``We hope those      younger people will say, `Well yeah, if it's not going to      cost me anything, sure.'

1035,topic-id,2095,"Mr.President, when the 18 million Americans in the individual insurance market--those are Americans, shopkeepers, songwriters, farmers, men and women who don't get their health insurance from the government or on the job--begin enrolling on Wednesday, they will discover something very strange.  The Wall Street Journal, in a weekend story, explained exactly how strange this phenomenon will be. Some of these 18 million Americans will be able to get their insurance for free. They will pay absolutely nothing for their premium, but others will see their premiums skyrocket far beyond the increases they have seen in recent years.  Here is what the Wall Street Journal says:       In nearly all of the 2,722 counties included in the data,      some consumers will be able to obtain free health insurance      because they qualify for larger federal premium subsidies      that cover the full cost of the plan, according to the new      analysis.  The Wall Street Journal continues:       In the coming weeks, insurers are gearing up to promote the      no-premium option. . . . On the flip side, those who don't      get premium subsidies under the 2010 law may be responsible      for the full brunt of steep rate increases, though they may      be able to mitigate the impact by staying away from silver      plans.  Insurers are gearing up to shepherd Americans into plans that will cost zero because taxpayers will be paying much higher subsidies. Meanwhile, the 9 million Americans in the individual health insurance market who do not have subsidies may be responsible for what the Wall Street Journal calls the ``full brunt of steep rate increases.''  What is causing this strange phenomenon? It is happening because Congress--us--has not funded cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs, for the 2018 plan year. Cost-sharing reduction subsidies are payments in the Affordable Care Act which the government makes to insurance companies to reimburse them for deductibles and copays for many low-income According to the U.District Court for the District of Columbia, the President of the United States can no longer make these payments himself without the approval of Congress so President Trump ended those payments this month.  Insurance companies have raised premiums to make up the difference, loading most of the increase on the silver plan premiums. They did that because, under the Affordable Care Act, subsidies are based on silver plan premiums. So as premiums go up, subsidies go up. If silver plan premiums skyrocket, then the subsidies skyrocket, and then you can use your giant subsidy to go buy a bronze plan and pay nothing in premiums.  In California alone, according to the Wall Street Journal article, about half of the 1.1 million who buy health insurance with subsidies can get their insurance for free next year. To be clear, because Congress didn't provide temporary funding for the cost-sharing reductions for 2018, more than half of Californians on the ACA exchange can get free government-paid healthcare.  For the last few weeks, I have been saying that the chaos we are going to see, if we don't continue the cost-sharing payments, will be a four-lane highway to single-payer insurance. Now we see why. Premium-free private insurance for millions funded by the taxpayer--I am not sure what is conservative about that.  We don't need to worry about the insurance companies. They obviously know how to take care of themselves. As the article details, if the cost-sharing payments aren't made over 2 years, insurance companies shouldn't lose a penny. They have to pay, under law,[[Page S6867]]the copays and deductibles, but they have already secured permission to raise premiums for 2018 to cover that. Because courts have said the payments are illegal, they secured approval of rates that are 20 percent higher in 2018 just for this purpose. So the insurance companies are not hurt by stopping the cost-sharing reduction payments.  If subsidized Americans aren't hurt by stopping the payments and insurance companies aren't hurt by stopping the payments, then who is hurt by stopping the payments? Hard-working, low-income Americans making less than $11,000 a year who don't qualify for Medicaid and Americans who make more than $47,000 a year and who therefore have no government subsidy to help buy insurance. They must face these premium increases on their own.  A hard-working Tennessean in the individual market--let's take a look at her. She has already seen her premiums increase 176 percent over the last 4 years. For 2018, it is going to be up another 36 percent in Tennessee, on average. She will pay the whole bill, no government help.  Then take the American taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that failure to continue the cost-sharing reduction payments increases premiums and therefore the subsidies to pay for those premiums by $194 billion over 10 years--$194 billion over 10 years added to the Federal debt because we don't continue the cost-sharing subsidies.  How do we avoid this? Believe it or not, we can avoid this situation by enacting a bill that will both prevent this strange phenomenon and reduce the Federal deficit by $3.8 billion. Senator Murray from Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee, and I introduced this bill. We were among 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats last week who proposed the bill and recommended it to the Senate, to the President, and to the House of Representatives after we conducted four hearings. In addition, we invited Senators not on the Senate HELP committee to join us in the development of this bill, and 37 showed up. We had about 60 of us who had some participation in the development of this proposal that Senator Murray and I recommended. We presented to the Senate our recommendation for continuing cost sharing and giving States more flexibility in approving premiums so people would have more choices and lower prices.  You may have noticed that a growing number of Republicans and conservatives are recommending that Congress act to continue for 2 years the so-called cost-sharing reduction payments as copays and deductibles for low-income The heads of the two tax-writing committees, Senator Hatch and Representative Kevin Brady, introduced legislation that would continue cost sharing in 2018 and 2019. In fact, earlier this year, almost all House Republicans voted to continue cost sharing for 2 years as part of their repeal-and-replace ObamaCare bill. Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham have said the provision to continue cost sharing temporarily would have been a part of their Senate repeal-and-replace bill, but Senate budget reconciliation rules didn't allow it.  President Trump has recognized this. He has asked for a short-term bill to prevent this kind of chaos. He encouraged me to talk to Senator Murray about this and to use cost-sharing reduction continuation as a way to negotiate some more flexibility for States so they could approve more choices at lower prices, which is exactly what Senator Murray and I did. That is what we recommended--the 24 of us, 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats--to the full Senate last week.  Some people still worry that continuing the cost-sharing payments is the same thing as propping up ObamaCare--those are the words we hear--or bailing out insurance companies. We hear those words too. In fact, just the reverse is true.  As the article explains in the Wall Street Journal, cutting off the cost-sharing payments, in the current circumstances, would increase insurance premiums on hard-working Americans who have no government subsidies, it would increase the Federal debt by nearly $200 billion over 10 years, and it would spend billions more in taxpayer dollars funding ObamaCare subsidies. Let me say that again. As the Wall Street Journal article explains, cutting off the cost-sharing payments in the current circumstances will increase insurance premiums on hard-working Americans who receive no government subsidies--up 36 percent in Tennessee--increase the Federal debt by $200 billion over 10 years, and spend billions more in taxpayer dollars funding ObamaCare subsidies.  There are two groups of people who would be basically held harmless if Congress does not approve the cost-sharing payments; one, Americans with ObamaCare subsidies; and, two, insurance companies. On the other hand, according to the CBO report last week, continuing the cost-sharing subsidies as part of the Alexander-Murray agreement would actually save taxpayers $4 billion by reducing premiums and therefore ObamaCare premium subsidies.  During 2018, it would provide rebates to consumers State by State to those hard-working Americans with no government subsidy, and it would begin to lower premiums in 2019. It would also give all Americans the opportunity to buy a new category of policy--catastrophic--so that a medical catastrophe doesn't turn into a financial catastrophe, and it would give States more flexibility to write policies with more choices at lower prices.  Many States want to do that. They need these additional flexibilities to stabilize their markets because problems with the individual market did not start with the uncertainty over the cost-sharing payments. We need to return power over the insurance markets to States if we want to begin creating long-term solutions.  The President and many others have said they don't want to bail out insurance companies. I don't want to bail out insurance companies. Senator Murray doesn't want to bail out insurance companies. I don't think I have run into anybody in the U.Senate who wants to bail out insurance companies. Our agreement doesn't bail out insurance companies. In fact, it does just the reverse.  If President Trump is looking for his majority, he might find it in Americans who don't like higher taxes and who don't like more government funding for ObamaCare subsidies. Somewhere the idea got started that continuing cost-sharing payments bails out insurance companies, but insurance companies are big boys and girls. They know how to take care of themselves, and they have proved it once again.  Failure to continue the cost-sharing subsidies is going to hurt taxpayers, and it is going to hurt unsubsidized Americans who have no subsidy to help buy their insurance. There is nothing conservative about that.  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the Wall Street Journal Weekend Edition entitled ``More ACA Plans to Come With No Premiums in 2018.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, 27, 2017]            More ACA Plans To Come With No Premiums in 2018             (By Anna Wilde Mathews and Christopher Weaver)       Trump indirectly bolstered the federal subsidies that help      consumers with their insurance premiums.

431,topic-id,570,"Mr.Speaker, if the United States is going to maintain the ability to feed and clothe our own people and fuel this American economy, we need a strong and sustainable rural America like the district I represent in west  What would this country be without the hardworking energy and agriculture producers in small towns across this great land? The heart of small-town sustainability is access to healthcare. There are over 5,000 hospitals in the United States, and roughly half of them are in rural America, serving one out of every five Without access to basic medical services, communities in America's breadbasket and energy basin would not survive.  Hospitals serving rural communities face unique challenges: an aging population, low patient volume, higher percentages of Medicare beneficiaries, to name a few. Each translates into a higher per-patient cost which has left 41 percent of rural hospitals operating at a loss.  On top of this problematic patient volume and patient mix, ObamaCare has heaped a backbreaking $54 billion in additional regulatory burden in unfunded mandates. Since 2010, the year ObamaCare was enacted, 80 rural hospitals have shut down, 11 of which were in my home State of If this rate continues, in less than 10 years, an unimaginable 25 percent of our Nation's rural hospitals will close. That would cripple rural communities across this country and deliver a devastating blow to our agriculture and energy economy, affecting all Americans, including our neighbors in urban and suburban  For some Texans, the nearest hospital is already 100 miles away. In an emergency, this distance can mean the difference between life and death. Point of fact: 60 percent of all trauma deaths occur in rural America, despite the fact that rural America only makes up 20 percent of the country's population.  Here is a startling fact and outright scary scenario: one-third of rural hospitals have been deemed vulnerable to closure. If all 673 of those hospitals were to close down, it could result in over 130,000 jobs lost and almost $300 billion in GDP lost. When unemployment goes down and wages go down in those small towns, folks move away in search of better opportunities.  In order to sustain the critical lifeline hospitals provide for our rural communities, I have introduced H.4178, the Healthcare Enhancement for America's Rural Towns Act, or the HEART Why? Because small towns are the heartbeat of America; the heart of our food, fuel, and fiber production; the heart of traditional American values. This legislation extends two programs vital to the sustainability of rural hospitals and the community they deserve: the Low-Volume Adjustment program and the Medicare-Dependent Hospital program. These programs account for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all Medicare expenditures, but they go a long way to ensuring that rural community hospitals with a higher percentage of Medicare patients have adequate funding to serve the unique populations.  By extending the Medicare Low-Volume Adjustment program for 2 years, and for the first time permanently extending the Medicare-Dependent Hospital program, we can provide the assurance and continuity that our rural hospitals desperately need in order to serve our communities in the future. Just as importantly, we do this in a way that is budget neutral and without spending any additional taxpayer moneys.  Let's pass this legislation. Let's protect the heart of rural America and give our community hospitals the certainty that they need to keep our people and our communities healthy.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8304.txt,1E+14,RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT OF 2017,2017,1,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
585,topic-id,1674,"Mr.President, this week the Senate is moving through a series of votes to fill vacancies in the Federal appeals court. President Trump has nominated highly qualified, mainstream judges and legal scholars to do these jobs. Now, Democrats have responded once again with delay and with obstruction. It is clear to me that we need to change the rules in the Senate that govern how we debate nominations in this body. All year Democrats have been putting up roadblocks to nominations. They have forced the majority leader to file cloture so that[[Page S6939]]then we can confirm nominees like these four judges.  As of last Friday, Democrats have forced the Senate to file cloture 47 different times when we have had to have cloture votes on President Trump's nominees. There were only six cloture votes at this point for the previous four Presidents--five for Obama, none for George Bush, one for Bill Clinton, and none under the Presidency of George Herbert Walker These are the kind of hoops that the Democrats have been making the Senate jump through in an effort to confirm President Trump's nominees.  The procedure has been set in place to allow for debate. Well, debate is a good thing in the Senate, as long as debate is actually occurring. It is a chance for Senators to stand up, to say what they like or what they don't like about a nominee. Now, if no one wants to debate, we should just move things along and have the vote. There is one Senate rule that allows for as much as 30 hours of debate time on Presidential nominations after we have actually had the cloture vote. Now, in reality, very little of that time that is spent on the Senate floor is actually being used for the debate. In the past, both sides would agree to waive the time requirements and to move on to other Senate business, which is what we need to do to get the country continuing to move forward. But what is happening now is that Democrats are insisting on cloture votes, and then they are insisting that we use hour after hour after hour, even when there is no one here to debate what is the issue or the person in front of us.  It is time to end this pointless spectacle. The Senate used to be called the world's greatest deliberative body. Democrats have turned it into the world's most paralyzed deliberative body.  We have more than 125 nominees for various jobs who have had hearings in committee, who have testified in committee, who have been voted on in committee, who have cleared through the entire committee-vetting process and are now waiting for a vote on the Senate floor--125 of them. Most of these people have bipartisan support. They will be confirmed easily and eventually. They should be confirmed immediately. There should be no reason for Democrats' stalling tactics except, once again, to slow down the pace of other progress in the Senate on legislative issues.  Mr.President, look at what happened with one judge last week. It is a case you are very familiar with. Scott Palk was nominated by President Trump to serve on the U.district court. He had bipartisan support in the Judiciary He went to the committee, had a hearing in the committee, and with bipartisan support was voted out of the committee. That was in June--more than 4 months ago.  Now, apparently that is not good enough for the Democrats--not at all. They are only interested in slowing down the work of the So we had a cloture vote on the nominee. It was 1 of the 47 cloture votes that we talked about. We had to have a cloture vote. Every Republican and 27 Democrats voted for him. So he had bipartisan support. We still had to allow all of this wasted time for the debate. We couldn't conduct any of the other business of the Senate during the time because the Democrats insisted that we use all of the debate time. Now, they could have very easily agreed to waive the rules, as we do, and go straight to a vote. We wanted to do that. The Democrats refused.  So how much of that time--those 30 hours--did the Democrats actually spend on the floor debating this person's qualifications to be a Federal judge? How many of those 30 hours did the Democrats use? How many minutes did they use? Not one Democrat came to the floor of the Senate to talk about that judge. Not a single Democrat even bothered to say a word against his nomination. There were fewer than 20 minutes of total talk on the floor of the Through hour after hour after hour of ongoing time, there were fewer than 20 minutes spent actually talking about the judge, and it was all spent in praise by the We still had to run out the clock because that is the delay game the Democrats are playing in the The Senate had to waste hours and hours when we could have finished debating in less than 20 minutes. The Democrats have done this same thing time after time after time, day after day, wasting day after day.  Things take time in the We understand that. That is what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they formed the two bodies of Congress, the House and the There is no excuse, though, for Democrats abusing the process to make things take even longer. Democrats aren't using the rules for debate. They are not using the rules for deliberation. It is only for delay. It hasn't always been this way, and there is no reason it should continue to be this way.  The Senate had a different standard for nominations a few years ago, and that was in the 113th In years 2013 and 2014, the Senate allowed just 2 hours of debate after cloture was invoked on nominations for district court judges. That is 2 hours more than the Democrats actually spent debating this judge's nomination last week. The rules said that we would have up to 8 hours to debate executive branch nominations below the Cabinet level. Then, for Cabinet Secretaries, for Justices on the Supreme Court, and for circuit courts, it was the full 30 hours of debate. Thirty hours now is what we allow every nomination today, and Democrats have shown that in most cases it is far too much time because even though we have to spend all the time, they use very little of it talking about the nominees.  We need a fair debate on every nomination. The procedure from 2013 and 2014, with fair debate on nominations, is one that was fair. The way the Democrats are wasting time today to keep us from doing our work is not fair. I believe it is time to return to the rules for debating nominees that the Senate used 3 years ago. There will still be plenty of time for Senators to debate the nominees, to raise objections if there are any. Every Senator could be on the record. There are just a lot of hours that we could avoid that are being wasted today that could be used to do the people's business of this country. A President's nominations of qualified people to important jobs was never meant to be a tool for delay in the Senate or to be an obstruction the way the Democrats have been using it.  Now, these rules that we used in 2013 and 2014 were the result of a compromise. Democrats controlled the Senate at the time. A Democrat, Barack Obama, was in the White House making the nominations, and Republicans agreed to make these changes to the rules. It was part of a bipartisan group, and I was part of that group. There were eight They worked on this compromise--four Republicans and four Senator McCain and Senator Alexander were part of this group. Senator Schumer, who is now the Democrat leader, was part of this group. There was overwhelming support for these changes on both sides of the aisle.  It is time to do it again. Let's change the Senate rules and go back to the process that Senator Schumer supported in 2013 and 2014. Today, the schedule allows us to do one or two nominations in a typical week. If we go back to the 2014 standard, we could clear multiple nominations in a day. The Republican Senate has been busy this year, and we have made progress on behalf of the American people. We have passed 15 resolutions rolling back destructive, Obama-era regulations using the Congressional Review Act and signed into law by the We passed a budget that will help give Americans at home a raise by cutting their taxes and giving us an opportunity to do the kind of tax relief, tax reform, tax reductions, tax cuts that the American people are looking for. We need to do more. It is time for Democrats to stop abusing the rules just to delay the process. It is time to go back to the previous standard of debating nominations. It is time to pick up the pace and do the job the American people expect us to do.  Now, if Democrats have a different approach and don't want to accept the standard of debate that was set in the previous Congress, then I believe it is time for us to force that change. If Democrats maintain their lockstep opposition to real progress on judicial vacancies and other nominees, we should give them a chance to vote on their continued obstruction. We can vote on these nominees in a straightforward[[Page S6940]]and efficient way or we can vote to return to the precedent of the 113th That is the choice. Either way, it is time to vote.

Every year at this event, the council honors an individual who made invaluable contributions to the community and demonstrates the values of the Scout oath and law.  Susie McMurry is a perfect choice to receive this special recognition. She is a role model in our community and truly represents a spirit of citizenship, leadership, and service. Throughout her life, Susie has always demonstrated an enduring devotion to God, her family, and She loves her family. She loves her home State of She loves her country.  She truly exemplifies the Scout promise ``to help other people at all times.'' Should an opportunity arise to improve the life of a child, Susie is the first to offer her assistance, time, and resources. Susie strongly supports programs for children that focus on mentoring, developing leadership skills, encouraging community service, and building self-esteem. She believes ``Children are the sunshine in our lives. If we don't take care of our children, our world will be without sunshine.''  Her parents raised her with a deep understanding of the importance of giving back. While growing up, her parents always lent a helping hand and opened their homes to individuals in need. Throughout her life, she has tried to follow their example. For nearly 30 years, she and her husband, Mick McMurry, were foster parents. They provided a safe and caring home for hundreds of children in  Susie is a strong, compassionate, and caring woman. In 1946, she was born in Casper at Memorial Hospital of Natrona She called both Elk Mountain and Hanna home before eventually moving to Susie discovered her calling to help children early in life. She studied elementary education at Casper College and the University of After graduation, she returned to Casper and taught first grade at Crest Hill Elementary  She met her husband of 41 years, Mick McMurry, in On December 21, 1973, Susie and Mick McMurry were married in Glenrock, A few years later, they adopted their daughter, Trudi, and Susie retired from teaching. In 1979, Susie and Mick became foster parents. Their second daughter, Jillian, was adopted from the foster program. Susie has eight grandchildren: Lou Davis, Tayla Davis, Tillie Holthouse, Ellie Holthouse, Evie Kaschmitter, Lily Kaschmitter, Max Kaschmitter, and Andrew She also has one great-grandchild, Neil In 2015, Susie, the McMurry family, Casper, and the State of Wyoming mourned the loss of her husband, Susie's compassion and strength continues to guide her family and our community.  The McMurry family has a remarkable history of helping people across the State of Susie explained, ``One of our goals is to teach the younger generation how to give back, how to participate, and love making a difference.'' Mick and Susie established the McMurry Foundation in 1998 with a mission to make a significant and beneficial impact on the lives of others. Guided by the values of excellence and compassion, the foundation has awarded more than $50 million since it was established. It focuses on education, religion, children and advocacy for children, health and human resources, the arts and humanities, and favorable business environments.  Buildings across the State bear the McMurry name as a mark of gratitude for their wonderful support. The number of places in Wyoming that have benefited from the contributions of the McMurry family is incredible, but one organization especially dear to Susie is the Wyoming Medical Susie has spent a tremendous number of[[Page S6999]]hours volunteering her time and talents to the benefit of everyone who comes through the doors. She feels that the health of a community is directly tied to the health of its people.  The values that Susie and the McMurry Foundation promote go hand in hand with the mission of the Boy Scouts of They both work to ensure youth have the knowledge and skills needed to become future leaders of Their continued focus on education, leadership, and community service will serve these young people and our State for generations.  Susie's kindness, generosity, and grace are true reflections of her character. She believes that fulfillment in life comes from making a difference in the lives of others. Whether it is volunteering at the Wyoming Medical Center to support patients and families or raising funds for the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming, she has made a huge difference in the lives of so many people. Susie continues to have a positive and lasting mark on our community.  It is with great honor that I recognize this exceptional member of our Wyoming community.

722,topic-id,1022,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests My district is home to three national forests, Ottawa, Hiawatha, and Huron-So when we use the term ``in our neck of the woods,'' we mean it.  We understand how vitally important proper management of forests is for our environment, our economy, and our special way of life in northern Michigan and the Upper I live right in the middle of the Ottawa National Forest, so this issue really does hit close to home for me.  Now as we have seen the devastation from forest fires in the West, it is more important than ever to have this debate. But it is impossible to talk about the need for wildfire suppression without talking about proper forest management. These two go hand in hand--or at least they should go hand in hand.                              {time}  1530  All too often, we hear rhetoric that managing our forests and removing dead or dying trees is a bad thing. This can't be further from the truth.  When we leave these dried, rotting trees laying on the forest floor, they become an incendiary breeding ground for fires. Those fires cost the Forest Service billions of dollars and countless hours of manpower to extinguish. Last year alone, we spent $2.9 billion on suppression efforts. This leaves barely any financial resources to allocate towards actually managing our forests.  H.2936 seeks to end this cycle. Let's get at the problem now so it doesn't become a disaster later. This is not a partisan issue. This is a commonsense solution for our federally owned forest land.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Forest Products Industry National Labor Management Committee and a letter from the Intertribal Timber                                                 October 31, 2017.     Rob Bishop,     House of Representatives,     Washington,     Subject: Support for HR 2936, The Resilient Federal Forests          Act of 2017.       Dear Congressman Bishop: As chair of the Forest Products      Industry National Labor Management Committee, I am writing in      strong support of HR 2936, The Resilient Federal Forests Act      of 2017. I urge you to vote in support of HR 2936 when it      comes to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote      on Wednesday, November 1.       The Forest Products Industry National Labor Management      Committee is a non-profit trust formed to pursue the common      public policy interests of the working men and women in the      forest products industry. Collectively, the Committee      represents more than two million workers across the nation,      including lumber and sawmill workers, woodworkers,      machinists, carpenters, and pulp and paper workers.       The balanced and sustainable management of our federally-     owned forests has been of significant interest to the      Committee since it was founded in 1990. Since that time, the      Committee has engaged on numerous pieces of federal forest      and related legislation.       HR 2936 is a bipartisan measure that will address the      growing economic and environmental threats posed by      catastrophic wildfires. HR 2936 provides a responsible      budgetary solution and targeted forest management reforms to      improve the health and resiliency of America's forests.      Adoption of these proposals will enhance federal forest      stewardship; protect forest ecosystems from catastrophic fire      and disease; and preserve rural, family wage jobs.       The Forest Products Industry National Labor Management      Committee urges you to vote in support of HR 2936, the      Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, when the measure comes      to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote this      week.           Sincerely,     Mike Draper,       Chairman, Forest Products Industry National Labor      Management                                  ____                                   Intertribal Timber Council,                                       Portland, OR, July 5, 2017.     Rob Bishop,     Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,                Dear Chairman Bishop: The Executive Board of the      Intertribal Timber Council (ITC) supports H.2936, the      Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, sponsored by      Bruce       We wish to particularly express our strong support for      Title VII, which will enhance tribal input and involvement in      the restoration of federal forest lands. Such restoration      projects are sorely needed to improve forest health and      reduce threats to lands held in trust for Indians as well as      non-trust federal land upon which Indian tribes access for      traditional, subsistence and treaty-guaranteed purposes.       Section 701 would provide timelines for review, approval      and implementation of Tribal Forest Protection Act projects.      This new authority is needed because of the underperformance      of the TFPA authority. Thirteen years after Congress passed      the TFPA, only three projects have been fully implemented,      while others linger in years of procedural abyss. As a      result, tribal forest lands remain at high risk of wildfire      coming from adjacent federal lands. This section would give      tribes the certainty to pursue TFPA projects with their      federal neighbors and reduce the risk of wildfire migrating      from federal lands onto Indian trust land.       Section 702 would give the Forest Service and BLM a new      ability to have tribes carry out forest restoration projects      in their homelands. Improvement of forest health and      ecological functions are vital to maintain watersheds and      fish and wildlife habitat on lands that may be subject to      federally-reserved tribal rights. Acting through the Bureau      of Indian Affairs, tribes would be able to restore lands      using the federal regulatory structure used on Indian trust      lands. As the Committee has noted on several occasions,      tribal forest management is able to achieve greater results      faster and at lower costs than on federal land. This      provision would help bring that successful management      approach to federal lands sorely in need of restoration.       Section 703 authorizes pilot authority for the Interior and      Agriculture Departments to grant ``638'' contracting      authority to tribes and tribal organizations for the      administrative and management functions of TFPA projects.       The ITC is a forty-one year old association of more than      fifty Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations that      collectively manage more than 90% of the 18 million acres of      forest land held in trust by the Bureau of Indian      The ITC is dedicated to pursuing the best management and      protection of tribal forests and other natural resources. We      actively participated in the development of the National      Indian Forest Resources Management Act (PL 101-630, 1990) and      the Tribal Forest Protection Act (PL 108-278, 2004). It is      our pleasure to now support H.2936.           Sincerely,                                                      Phil Rigdon,                                                         ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326.txt,1E+14,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

719,topic-id,315,"Mr.Chairman, I don't have any strong objections to the parts of this bill that deal with forest resilience, and I yield to people who know a lot more about forests than I do.  But I am concerned that H.2936 is harmful for all of the species that rely on forests for habitat and that the bill specifically includes provisions that specifically attack and undermine the Endangered Species  The bill allows the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to unilaterally determine if authorized logging and forestry management actions would adversely affect listed species or critical habitat without ever consulting experts at the U.Fish and Wildlife Service as is required by the Endangered Species  Furthermore, the bill declares that, for purposes of the ESA, all logging and other forestry activities carried out pursuant to the bill are ``nondiscretionary'' actions. Deeming these actions to be nondiscretionary serves as a direct waiver of the Endangered Species Act regulations and protections and allows forest activities to violate the ESA and jeopardize species.  Another provision exempts the Forest Service and BLM from implementing regulations that require consultation on management plans when a new species is listed as threatened or endangered or there is a new critical habitat designation.  This, in particular, will have profound implications for species that have been proposed or are candidates for listing under the ESA that rely on these lands for habitat, such as the North American wolverine.  In short, this bill dismantles interagency consultation that is integral to wildlife protection under the Endangered Species  America's forests are home to over 400 threatened or endangered species, including the Florida panther, native wild trout, and the black-footed ferret. We cannot allow this bill to strip protections for these iconic species and eliminate environmental review processes for our Nation's forests. So on this basis--the threat to the Endangered Species Act--I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''[[Page H8329]]    ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326.txt,2272,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2936, RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT",2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I appreciate him sharing some time with me tonight as I share several important stories.  Mr.Speaker, these are stories of real people, not just some people who are distant to us. These are people that we know, people just like this.  Mr.Speaker, one early January morning in 2015, a young man named Grant Ronnebeck began the graveyard shift at a QuikTrip convenience store in my district. After his parents divorce, Grant took the initiative to find a job working at this convenience store[[Page H8432]]in Mesa, Arizona, to help his family pay the bills. He was only 21 years old. He had his entire life ahead of him.  Just before 4 a.m., an angry customer walked in, demanded a pack of cigarettes, and dumped a handful of change on the store counter. Grant started to count the money, but he saw the customer pull a gun out and point it directly at his head.  Grant tried to immediately hand over the cigarettes in a desperate attempt to save his life, but it was too late. The customer shot Grant in the face in cold blood, took the cigarettes, and casually walked out of the store.  Grant's father describes him as being his buddy from the minute he was born and a person that brightened everybody. He did not leave the store alive that night.  The customer's name was Apolinar He was an illegal alien with a long criminal record, including violent crimes. He was held in Federal custody, but then released while he awaited deportation proceedings. Our government let Grant down when they allowed Grant's killer to walk out of custody and onto our streets.  Altamirano should have remained in custody until he was deported, but he was set free, and Grant was killed due to the government's failure to hold this violent criminal in custody until deported.  Sadly, Grant's story is not unique. Many Americans are aware of another tragic incident, the case of Kate Kate was 32 years old. She was walking along a San Francisco pier when an illegal alien shot and killed her. This illegal alien had just been released from prison again. He should have been held until deportation, but he, in fact, had been deported many times previously.                              {time}  1845  Even then, he was set free, only to kill Kate  In 2014, Mesa, Arizona, Police Officer Brandon Mendoza was killed in a wrong-way crash by an illegal alien who was driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol.  And in January 2016, Sarah Root was murdered by an illegal alien who was drunk and drag racing in Omaha,  In each of these cases, Grant and Brandon, I am privileged to know their parents, Steve Ronnebeck and Mary Ann These are fierce advocates who tirelessly work to make sure these types of tragedies never happen to another family. I am grateful for their efforts, and I believe that we are making significant headway to stop these types of catch and release programs that allow criminals to remain on our streets.  In June of this year, the House of Representatives passed H.3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.3004, Kate's Law, tandemly. These bills would end the policies that contributed to the tragic deaths of Grant, Kate, Brandon, and  I was pleased to coauthor the first bill, which included my legislation, Grant's Grant's Law is named in memory of Grant  All Americans can agree that someone who is criminally violent should not be released back on to the streets. Yet, for years, the Obama administration's policies failed to protect Americans by allowing criminally violent illegal aliens to roam our streets and neighborhoods.  These types of tragedies are preventable when the Federal Government enacts and enforces the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Congress has begun to take meaningful action to bring these tragedies to an end, starting with the two bills we passed in  Chairman Bob Goodlatte showed leadership and commitment to ensure these important bills received swift consideration. These two bills, if enacted and enforced, would protect innocent Americans to prevent future tragedies like those of Grant, Kate, Brandon, and  When the bills passed out of the House, I hoped these bills would receive a swift vote in the That has not happened. I am still hoping for this vote to take place. I call upon the leadership of the Senate to put these bills up for a floor vote.  We owe it to our constituents to put arcane tradition aside and to pass policies that will protect them. Yet, even in a Republican-controlled Senate, we cannot receive an up-or-down vote on these important immigration enforcement bills.  Why is this?  Mr.Speaker, I firmly believe the answer lies in the fatally flawed 60-vote rule. It is more commonly known as the filibuster, but the Senate's tradition is preventing consideration of nearly all legislation passed from the  For example, look at our current situation. Since January, the House has passed over 300 bills, including the two immigration and enforcement bills I have just discussed. These bills will most likely languish until the end of the term, in large part, due to the filibuster rule.  So what can be done about this irresponsible inaction? Well, the Senate can change the rule. Indeed, the Senate must change the rule.  Many people do not realize that the 60-vote requirement is not even in the United States It dates back to 1917, when the Senate agreed that debate could be cut off with a two-thirds majority vote. Decades later, when deciding a two-thirds vote was found to be too difficult to achieve, the Senate reduced the number of required votes to three-fifths, or 60 of the current 100  The filibuster is a tradition, barely a century old, less than half the age of the U. There is a place for rules and traditions, but not when they obstruct the will of American people. Is it honorable for the United States Senate to have a gentleman's agreement to keep bills from being voted on, or to dilute our representation in the United States Senate?  Americans would rather that Congress pass just and reasonable laws than to preserve extraconstitutional, institutional traditions. Americans want our borders secure and our immigration laws to be enforced.  Congress is running out of time to keep its promises to the American people. We promised to ensure that what happened to Kate, Grant, Brandon, and Sarah would not happen again. The House has done its duty. It is time for the Senate to do its duty.  There are no excuses to allow these bills to die in the I encourage my friends in the Senate to eliminate the 60-vote rule and to consider the two immigration enforcement bills that the House passed in We must not allow inaction to be the enemy of our sworn responsibilities as representatives of the American people.  Again, I thank my friend from I appreciate the opportunity to say what has been on my mind for some time.

854,topic-id,469,"Mr.Speaker, I am here this evening, along with my friend and colleague, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, as we advocate for the passage of the Right to Try This bill, which we introduced together, has dozens of bipartisan cosponsors, including Members here tonight.  We are both supportive of Senator Ron Johnson's efforts to champion Right to Try in the He has been a tireless advocate of Right to Try for years, and his bill has already passed the Senate with unanimous consent. If you are watching the Senate very closely, you will know that nothing comes out of there, and certainly nothing with unanimous consent; so that tells how strong the sentiment is in favor of this bill.  Our legislation allows terminally ill patients who have no further options left--I repeat that, no further options left--the opportunity to try experimental drugs that could save their own lives.  Yes, there are also provisions in our bill to protect both the patients, as well as the pharmaceutical companies who want to participate, but those provisions are secondary to the primary purpose of this legislation. The primary purpose of the Right to Try Act is to give brave patients across this country some choice over their own destinies, when all other avenues are gone.  We want to give hope to these Americans, and we should all share that same goal of doing everything we can for patients fighting to save their lives. This policy has significant bipartisan support. The Trump administration strongly supports Right to Try, and President Trump has indicated he would likely sign this bill into law.  Time is of the essence, for time is one thing a terminally ill patient does not have. And the status quo is not the answer. The FDA and other agency officials claim that their own expanded access program is working and continues to improve. There may be some truth to that, but the program is simply not enough; and I know that because I have talked to dozens and dozens of patients, family members, and advocates who tell me it is not enough. They come to my office, they call me on the phone, they write me impassioned letters.  These same advocates have ensured that Right to Try has become law in 38 Think about that for a moment. With one more State, you could actually ratify a Constitutional amendment. And in half of those 38 States, Right to Try laws passed with unanimous support. In my home State of Arizona, voters approved that initiative by 80 percent of the popular vote.  At a time when pundits are claiming that our politics are broken, and Republicans and Democrats can't come together on anything, here is a cause that Americans of all political stripes can unite in.

863,topic-id,738,"Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to mention how I came to really be converted to the cause of right to try.  I served in the Arizona State Legislature with Laura Knaperek, who was also serving in the legislature when I first met her. By 2014, she was no longer serving in the State legislature. She was an advocate. That year, Laura was in the fight of her life against ovarian cancer, and her mission was to see right-to-try legislation passed into law.  In the end, her efforts for this cause succeeded beyond everyone's wildest expectations when 80 percent of the electorate in Arizona voted to enact right to try. But, unfortunately, Laura is not with us because she lost her brave battle with cancer last year. Her legacy as a tireless patient advocate lives on.  I will continue to carry on the fight not just for Laura Knaperek, but for all those patients across this country who are battling against the odds every day.  I am joined by those who are here tonight, those who have cosponsored this bill, and many other advocacy groups, such as the Goldwater Institute in Arizona that continues to fight for this.  I fight for Bertrand Bertrand is a very special little boy. He was the first person ever to be diagnosed with a rare, fatal genetic disorder called NGLY1 that has left this 7-year-old paralyzed. Because the disease was only identified by scientists in 2012 and only a few people worldwide have been diagnosed with it, there is no cure and no treatment available. Because the disorder is so rare, a drug may never be developed to treat it.  But scientists have found that Bertrand responds to certain investigational therapies. So Bertrand's family will have to rely on trying those new investigational medications as long as they have access to them. That is why we need this right-to-try legislation.  I fight for Jordan Seven-year-old Jordan says he wants to grow up to be a firefighter so he can save lives. He has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which could leave him paralyzed within 5 years and shortens his life expectancy to only 20 years. There is a drug now being used in clinical trials that is helping young people like Jordan, but it could take another 7 years for that drug to be available on the market. His parents cannot afford to wait for the FDA to give that drug its final approval. He could be in a wheelchair by then. This investigational drug could add years to Jordan's life, which would give him the chance to save others.  We have already heard, when Representative Fitzpatrick discussed Matt Bellina, his needs and his advocacy. We fight for him, and we fight for Mikaela  At 24, Mikaela was diagnosed with a deadly form of kidney cancer that had already migrated into her bones before she even knew she was sick. She went through every known treatment in a matter of months and nothing worked. Her high school sweetheart, Keith, heard about a drug under development that was successfully treating people with this same cancer, but Mikaela was not allowed to enroll in the clinical trial. Mikaela and Keith launched a social media campaign to try to get access to the drug, but it wasn't enough. The FDA didn't help.  Mikaela died on April 24, 2014. Five months later, on September 4, the FDA gave final approval to the drug that might have saved her.  I fight for Diego When he was 10 years old, Diego woke up with a sore leg that his mom thought was just another sports injury, but the pain didn't go away. They knew something was wrong, but they never expected osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer.  After exhausting all treatments available, Diego's doctors recommended he try mifamurtide, which wasn't available in the United States but was being safely used and had been given the Prix Galien Award, the gold medal for pharmaceutical development in The Morris family wasted no time and made the move abroad to try to save Diego's life. The treatments worked. Now Diego is back home in Phoenix and back to playing his favorite sports.  We fight unitedly for the countless other patients who deserve a right to try. We must act without further delay. Again, I thank those who have been here to testify tonight.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381.txt,1E+14,RECOGNIZING RACHEL CHAMPNEY,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

953,topic-id,437,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding and for his time managing today's floor debate.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.1074, a bill I first introduced in the 114th Congress, which would repeal a 1948 law that granted the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against members of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in  Prior to this 1948 law, the Tribe had largely policed itself, and there was little, if any, Federal law enforcement on the Tribe's land.  Historically, determining who may exercise jurisdiction over crime in tribal communities is complex. Generally, crimes committed by or against Indians in Indian Country are under the jurisdiction of the United States, pursuant to various Federal statutes. The 1948 Act was passed at a time when the Federal Government was attempting to shift its responsibility and obligations from tribes to the respective  In 1953, Congress passed a law, commonly called Public Law 280, transferring criminal jurisdiction over all crimes, regardless of the Indian status of the offender or victim, in Indian Country of six States from the Federal Government to those Even though Iowa was not one of those States, for years it has been treated as if it were a Public Law 280  With respect to the law enforcement on the settlement today, a lot has changed since 1948. Today, the Tribe has a fully-functional criminal justice system, which includes a full-time police department whose officers are certified by the State of The Tribe maintains and employs law-trained judges and a prosecutor who, together with a probation department, handle all criminal cases which arise on tribal lands.  H.1074, and its Senate companion bill, have bipartisan support from the entire Iowa delegation, as well as the support of the Iowa State Legislature, which passed legislation signed by then-Governor Terry Branstad in April 2016, that began this process of conferring jurisdiction to the Tribe and the Department of  As my friend from California previously mentioned, the entirety of the Meskwaki Settlement is located in Tama County, Iowa, in my district. Since I have come to Washington, I have gotten to know the Sac and Fox Tribal Council and their representatives, and I was happy to first introduce this bill in 2016 after its approval by then-Governor  Mr.Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I hope it continues to move through the legislative process so that the Tribe may once again have jurisdiction over many of the crimes committed against their members on their land, and restore another portion of the Tribe's sovereignty, which has been removed since 1948.

587,topic-id,2141,"Mr.President, the magnitude of this moment should be apparent to all. A sitting U.President's campaign chief and his protege have been indicted for conspiring against the United Another campaign adviser has pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about meetings with At those meetings, he illegally discussed obtaining dirt on the President's political opponent and emails that had been stolen.  Two points need to be underscored for the American people. First, these indictments and conviction are a sober, shattering moment in American history. Second, all of us on both sides of the aisle should come together to support the work of the special counsel and assure that he is able to follow the facts and the law and all of the evidence, wherever they may lead.  This moment will stand as a landmark in American history, just as many of the moments in Watergate did. This investigation has proceeded more quickly than Watergate did. John Mitchell was indicted in 1974 for conspiracy, perjury, and obstruction of justice. He was convicted a year later. That indictment took a year and a half of investigation. These indictments have occurred just 11 months after the election and barely 6 months after the beginning of the investigation.  We know that the President's campaign hired two alleged criminals and one admitted criminal. Two of them were foreign agents, and the campaign was run by a Russian agent, unregistered, now charged with conspiring against the United He was supported by another Russian foreign agent who was also charged with the same 12 criminal counts. These two individuals, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, were significant people in the Trump campaign.  In the case of Gates, his influence continued through the early months of the new administration. Manafort ran Trump's campaign at its most critical point, and he organized and directed the 2016 Republican National Committee convention, including the critical delegate-corralling effort against a potential ``Never Trump'' insurrection, securing the Republican nomination for Donald  Under Manafort's leadership of the Trump campaign, the Republican Party stripped language from their platform that would have called for arming Ukraine against Russian aggression. Ahead of the convention, Manafort also offered to brief a Russian billionaire on the state of the 2016 race. The convention he helped organize became a venue for a meeting between Attorney General Sessions and the Russian ambassador, after which the Attorney General misled Congress, implying--indeed stating--that it never took place.  The Trump campaign also worked extensively with George Papadopoulos, a foreign adviser whose actions constitute the most significant indication of possible collusion--so far the most significant--between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  Papadopoulos was named a foreign policy adviser in March 2016 and began communicating with Russian nationals the next month. He met with a professor for breakfast in They discussed stolen emails from Hillary Clinton and subsequently shuttled messages to the Kremlin and back for the Trump campaign.  He worked with officials at the highest level of the Trump campaign. His direct boss, in fact, was Jeff Sessions, who was then the head of Trump's national security advisory committee, and he is now, of course, the Attorney He communicated extensively with the campaign manager and members of the national security team.  President Trump tweeted today that he was a ``young, low level volunteer,'' but the President sang his praises at a meeting with the Washington Post editorial board in March 2016, calling him an ``energy and oil consultant, excellent guy.'' These revelations are stunning.  Now the President is at a critical juncture. He can choose the course of cooperation or confrontation. He is literally teetering on the brink of a decision that could prove disastrous for himself and for America if he chooses a constitutional confrontation.  We are at a moment very much like the one that occurred in It is still memorable to many of us in this Chamber, although we were not here at the time. Our Nation could be careening toward a constitutional crisis. Some of the actions the President has already taken, such as firing Jim Comey as FBI Director, may be evidence of obstruction of justice in the investigation by the special counsel. As part of our oversight responsibility, the Judiciary Committee must continue its work in investigating that firing and other actions that may constitute obstruction of justice.  Firing the special counsel himself is something only the President could try to do. It would be the ultimate act of contempt for the rule of law that is rightly seen as the actions of someone who has something to hide.  At stake is more than just this President or this special counsel. It is literally the rule of law. To this President, the rule of law may be meaningless, a facade or a fiction, but that is exactly why Congress must give the judicial branch specific, enforceable power to stop the President from firing the special counsel.  That is the purpose of legislation I have introduced, along with colleagues. I am here to call upon this body to support and pass the Special Counsel Independence Protection  I called for the special counsel to be established in February of this year and was joined by 10 of my colleagues in that call. It was based on credible allegations that the Trump team had colluded with the Russian The Special Counsel Independence Protection Act, which I have cosponsored along with colleagues, seeks to forestall the kind of potential constitutional crisis raised by the President's threats not so long ago and his labeling the investigation a hoax and a witch hunt.  The Washington Post reported today that advisers close to the President are urging that, in fact, he take more aggressive action against the special counsel. The specter of Presidential action against Robert Mueller, designed to stop or stymie a virtually unavoidable and necessary criminal investigation of the President himself, makes safeguarding the special counsel more urgent and necessary now than ever before.  Rather than encouraging Presidential abuse of power by inaction, the Congress must move forward right away to check potential malfeasance and abuse before it occurs. Even the threat of such political interference constituting potential obstruction of justice undermines the special counsel's investigation. It makes witnesses less likely to cooperate. It discourages the agents and investigators working for the special counsel. It creates unnecessary confusion in the American public. Only judicial review can provide the check against such abuse and ensure confidence that the special counsel will proceed methodically and systematically to uphold the rule of law and follow the facts in evidence, wherever they may lead. That is what the American people want him to do. That is what we should guarantee that he will do. Make no mistake, this investigation will continue and conclude fairly and fully. The only question is how much turmoil and how much damage is done in the course of that investigation.  Clearly, like any investigation and prosecution, this one is a mosaic, consisting of many different diverse pieces and already it is coming together on the Trump campaign's contacts with Russian officials. They include, for example, campaign adviser Papadopoulos's contacts with a Russian agent who claimed he had ``dirt'' on Hillary Clinton; Donald Trump, Jr., and the campaign aides' Trump Tower meeting with Russian agents to obtain information on Clinton; Jared[[Page S6941]]Kushner's meetings with sanctioned VEB Russian bank CEO Sergey Gorkov; Sessions' meetings with the Russian Ambassador; the Cambridge Analytica CEO's outreach to WikiLeaks to obtain Hillary Clinton's missing emails; and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's dining with President Putin in Those pieces of the mosaic are only the beginning. We are at a critical stage--the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end.  As a former prosecutor, I know investigations take time. The best investigations are done without deadlines. In an important case like this one, and in a complex and challenging one, we must allow all the time necessary to assemble that full mosaic and put together the pieces of this puzzle.  The Watergate scandal took 2 years to unravel, from Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's first piece in the Washington Post in June of 1972 to Nixon's resignation in August of 1974. We are less than a year into the Trump Presidency and fewer than 10 months into this investigation.  The first individuals to be indicted in the Watergate scandal were considered to be generally outside the President's inner circle. They were Howard Hunt, Gordon Liddy, and the Watergate burglars in September of 1972. No one knew--and many denied--the conspiracy that involved the President and his top lieutenants at the time of those first indictments. In these cases, too--in these first indictments and conviction--a lot more is to come.  We cannot wait until the President potentially shuts down his special counsel to come to his defense. Already, the rule of law is under threat. On Sunday--the day before the indictments were handed down--the President tweeted: ``DO SOMETHING!'' with regard to the Russia investigation. Although his reference was unclear exactly what he meant and whom the message was targeting, it certainly was an indication that some kind of action might be taken to thwart the investigation.  Any interference in this investigation will be a red line for me and for others in this Let the President hear that message loud and clear. There is a red line that cannot be crossed. It is political interference or intrusion in the special counsel's investigation, and it will be met with a firestorm, I hope, on both sides of the aisle. My conversations with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle indicate they would share our outrage and outcry if there is an effort to stop and stymie this investigation or if there is any other kind of political interference in it.  Senators Graham, Booker, Whitehouse, Coons, and I have cosponsored measures that will help protect the special counsel. There are two measures now, but they are so closely similar that they should be brought together, and conversations are underway to do so. I expect we will have a single bill in the very near future.  We should stand with one voice against obstruction of this investigation. I ask that my colleagues go on the record now to state that they will absolutely resist and oppose any interference by the executive branch into this investigation or investigations that are underway by our congressional committees--on the House side, the Intelligence Committee and, in the Senate, the Judiciary Committee along with our Intelligence The congressional committees have separate purposes. In the Judiciary Committee, we have the unique responsibility of oversight over the Department of Justice and the We have the unique responsibility to prevent the obstruction of justice and to uncover it, as is indicated by the firing of Jim My hope is that investigation will proceed and that it will be bipartisan, so we will have hearings and subpoena witnesses with public testimony under oath and eventually some report to the American people. That is my hope, and that will be our decision here.  The decision we cannot and should not make is what the outcome will be of the special counsel investigation. We must guarantee--and we have this responsibility in the Congress--that there is adequate funding and authority for the special counsel, that there is no effort to either cut resources or limit the purview of the special counsel or place constraints on the time it may take for this probe to conclude. There should be no firing and no pardons, and we should speak out and stand up to assure that message reaches the White House loud and clear.  This moment is one of historic magnitude. I cannot emphasize how strongly I feel but also how deeply my colleagues have expressed to me their own feelings about our responsibility in this moment.  The grand jury that is bringing these indictments is an arm of the courts, which should be independent of both the executive and legislative branches. That independence gives the special counsel some new measure of permanence and protection, but the President can still try to fire the special counsel. He cannot fire the grand jury or the U.District Court judge who impaneled the grand jury. Judicial review of any firing of the special counsel, which is the core principle of our measure--the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act--would add a highly significant protection to not just deter misguided and deeply mistaken actions, throwing our Nation into turmoil, but also assuring that confidence and trust remains with the special counsel, and he can follow facts and the law with the full support of the American people. The American people can put their trust and faith in him and in our courts. We should assure that we uphold that faith and trust.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

503,topic-id,1826,"Mr.President, this week we are moving to confirm four Federal circuit judges. Because of that, it is a good week to talk about the critical role the judiciary plays and actually about the unique power our Constitution gave the courts to do the job they are supposed to do.  They are to provide a check and balance on the other two coequal branches of government--the executive branch and the legislative branch. Most importantly, the Federal judiciary provides Americans with an avenue with which to seek the rule of law, an avenue to know that one is going to be impacted by what the law says and what the Constitution says. It is a fundamental right of how we conduct ourselves, how we seek justice, how people should be able to make decisions about their families and about their businesses and about their financial futures as well as their personal futures.  That is why judges who believe in the rule of law and what the law says and what the Constitution says are so important and why it is important to have qualified and well-grounded judges--not just people who are really good lawyers but people who have an appreciation for how important it is that others can absolutely rely on the law and the Those can be changed. There is a way to change them, but the way to change them is seldom on the Federal bench.  According to the Administrative Office of the U.Courts, as of this morning, there are 148 vacancies on the Federal judiciary. That includes two vacancies on the Eighth Circuit Court of It includes the circuit judges of whose nominations we have not yet fully complied and approved this week, but there are 148 vacancies--jobs that are to be filled for as long as the people are able to serve. That is why healthy judges, younger judges, and judges who are well grounded can have such an impact for so long. The first major judicial accomplishment this year, in terms of the nominating process, was Judge Gorsuch, who 29 years from now will be younger than three of the judges with whom he is currently serving. These are decisions that will last well beyond a Presidency and well beyond the tenure of the Senators who will vote to confirm, and we have a chance to do that.  Of these judicial circuits, the Eighth Circuit is one my State of Missouri is in. As a matter of fact, the most recent data shows that while there are a handful of States in that circuit, one-third of all the cases that had been filed in the Eighth Circuit from September 2015 to September 2016 had come from our State, and I imagine that number will be about the same again this year. Reshaping the judiciary, generally, as well as what happens in the Eighth Circuit are important.  At the start of President Trump's term, 12 percent of all of the positions[[Page S6950]]in the Federal judiciary were vacant. The Congressional Research Service found that not since President Clinton took office has a President had the constitutional obligation to fill more judicial vacancies at the start of his term than President I, certainly, believe he made the right choice when he selected Judge Gorsuch to serve on the Court, and I have been enthusiastic about the other judges whom he has nominated, including the four we have had a chance to talk about and will continue to have a chance to talk about this week.  I think President Trump will continue to nominate judges who will, first of all, pay attention to the Constitution and what it says, who will apply the rule of law, and will not legislate from the bench. Those three hallmarks of how this Senate should define, and how this President has so far defined, what a judge is supposed to do not only can happen but can happen at this moment for--or at least as of January 20--12 percent of the judicial positions, and that number will continue to grow as judges, for whatever reason, leave the bench as judges decide to take early retirement. If at the end of the 4 years of this administration we have filled all of the vacancies that will have occurred, we will have filled more than 12 percent of those lifetime appointments. So it is really important that the Senate act to confirm these nominees and fill as many vacancies as are there to be filled.  Last month, the Federalist reported: ``Democrats are forcing more cloture votes than any early Presidency and demanding the full 30 hours of floor time per nominee that the Senate rules allow.''  Yesterday, at the press stakeout that we had outside of this room, I said that the Senate was designed to protect the rights of the minority, and that is a good thing. Just the fact that it would take 6 years to replace the entire Senate means that the country has to stay focused on one set of ideas if all of the Senators are going to reflect that one set of ideas much longer than the 2-year opportunity to change everybody in the Also, the understanding that the Senate provides that protection for minorities to be heard in a big and diverse democracy like we have is a good thing. In the points that we were making yesterday, I also said that the protections for the minority are always held onto, appreciated, and protected until the minority decides to abuse those protections. When that happens, the minority always loses the protection.  What we have had over and over again--47 times this year as compared to 1 time with President Obama for nonjudicial appointments, 5 times in the entire first Obama year up until this time in October, I believe, no times for either President Bush, and 1 time for President Clinton--is that the minority has taken a judicial nomination or another nomination and said we are going to insist on 30 hours of debate because the rules allow for 30 hours of debate. Well, the rules allow for 30 hours of debate for contentious nominees. The rules allow for 30 hours of debate when there is really going to be a debate. Last week, we had 30 hours of debate on a judge, but 20 minutes were spent talking in support of him while zero minutes were spent in opposing him. The 30 hours that could have been used for other purposes was gone.  Frankly, I think that was the reason the 30 hours was demanded--so the other work of the Senate had to be set aside so we could do the equally important work of letting the President put people in vacant positions that needed to be filled. That 30 hours will be changed if the minority continues to abuse it. It has happened in the entire history of the Senate, but that is what happens when you abuse these rules that protect you and give you rights. It will happen again here if this does not change.  We see the same thing happening this week. We have had lots of time this week--30 hours of debate, a final vote, and Democrats and Republicans vote. In fact, regarding the judge I mentioned a minute ago, 28 Democrats voted for that judge. There were 30 hours of debate, and not a single critical word was spoken in debate about the judge. A majority of the Democrats and virtually all of the Republicans voted for that judge. That is not an acceptable way to stop the Senate from getting to the other work the Senate needs to do. This is not basketball without a clock, where they used to effectively play the delay game. The delay game got abused, and the clock became part of the system. The clock will run faster here, too, if our colleagues do not begin to see the importance of what we do here.                       Nomination of David Stras  Mr.President, while these nominees have had cloture votes--again, President Obama, I think, only had one on a judge in his first year--there is one nominee, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras, in the Eighth District, which is the district again that Missouri is in, who has had his nomination held up. There is a rule sometimes that has been used in the Senate--almost always if a judge is being replaced that only affects your State--whereby a Senator can say: I am really opposed to that. In most of the history of the Senate, that kind of hold has been honored. It has not been honored on judges who represent another State, many States, or will be a judge in the circuit for many States just because they happen to come from your  The American Bar Association has said that Justice Stras is ``well qualified.'' It is its very highest rating. He received his bachelor's degree, with the highest distinction, from the University of Kansas, which is another State in this circuit. He received his MBA from the University of Kansas and his law degree from the University of He clerked on the U.Supreme Court before practicing law and teaching at the University of Not only was he appointed to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in Minnesota, but he was elected. In fact, he was elected and received more votes than the person who is holding his nomination received when he was elected to that job.  I urge my colleagues to not only support his nomination but to do what we need to do to get these nominees to the floor and let everybody express their opinion and be given the time needed to do that, not to continue to abuse the rules, not to continue to hold these important vacancies hostage to getting anything else done because we have 30 hours of debate in which nobody decides to come and debate.  By the way, if we want to continue to allow Senators to hold nominations in circuits that their States happen to be a part of, in the Eighth Circuit, most of the work before that court comes from Missouri more than any other We would be glad to have an additional judge, and there is nothing that would prevent that.  The right thing to do here is to let the nomination of a well-qualified person come to the Senate floor and be debated, if there is debate to be had, and be voted on and to take one of those significant 140-plus vacancies on the Federal judiciary and fill it with a person who is well qualified, just like this week. In four other circuits, we intend to put three women and one man on those courts who will hopefully be able to serve long and well and will take their important philosophies to the courts with them when they go.

898,topic-id,1496,"Mr.President, I am here today to join my colleague from Indiana in support of the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to be on the U.Court of Appeals for the Seventh As we all know, that is the highest court you can serve on, except for the Supreme The circuit court is the court that often makes the final determination of what the law says if the Supreme Court chooses not to act or isn't asked to act. These are important jobs to be filled and carry great responsibility.  This week, Amy Coney Barrett, two other women, and one man will come before this Senate to be confirmed to various circuit courts around the country. As others have come to the floor to point out, she is extremely qualified. She should be confirmed by the Senate this week.  In letters to the Senate Judiciary Committee, 73 law professors agreed that ``Professor Barrett's qualifications for a seat on the U.Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit are first rate.''  Her former law school students wrote that they would like to see her on the court.  She is a distinguished scholar in areas of law that matter most to the Federal courts. She respects the She understands that the job of a judge is to see what the Constitution and the law say, rather than what she thinks they should say. She is known for her careful work, for her fairminded disposition, and for her personal integrity.  Similar things have been noted by people who served with her as Supreme Court law clerks. Law clerks, her former students, and lots of other groups that have had reason to know her and evaluate her work over the years have been universal in one thing; that is, that she would be a great addition to a circuit court in the United States and particularly to this court.  It is discouraging that during her confirmation hearings, several of my colleagues felt it appropriate to question Professor Barrett's faith. She is not the only one of President Trump's nominees who have been subject to this line of questioning. In fact, in June, one Senator held out the idea that a person who was going to be in the Office of Management and Budget might not be well suited or able to serve in that job not because he didn't have the background, not because he didn't have the preparation, not because he didn't know what the job was all about but because of his answers to questions about his personal view of faith.  Even when the United States, in its earlier times, may have quietly discriminated against people of faith, it was never publicly stated. Sometimes it took a long time for the first Jew to serve on the Court and a little time for the first Catholic to serve on the Supreme Court, but there was never a stated question like there has been in this Senate about those topics. It is shocking, in many ways, that it would be something we would be talking about in the United States of America today.  The idea that a qualification for public office would require a religious test, in fact, was specifically prohibited not just in the Bill of Rights, in the protections for religion there, but in the Constitution itself. The people who wrote the Constitution did so at a time when a religious test was often the test for service and of fealty to a specific religion or the tradition of fealty to the monarch, who was the head of the church in that country. Many countries had a church where the monarch was clearly understood to be the principal representative of the church in that country. Even in a time when that was still the case and fresh in their minds and when there may have been religious tests in some of the colonies--even then--in the Constitution, article VI says: ``No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.''  So is it even appropriate to ask a religious question? Most questions in America you are free to ask, but are you free to ask that under the determination of the Constitution, as if it matters? In response to this line of questioning, some members of the Senate Judiciary Committee made it clear that it is never appropriate for those questions to be asked, while others asked them. But Professor Barrett, in her own writings, has said that if a person's religious faith or their faith principles ever become an obstacle to determining what the law says, then they should step back and not be a part of that case. They should not, according to her, impose their personal convictions on the law but read what the law says. If they can't do that, they should make way for a judge who can. I think, maybe, that is one of the differences in a judicial nominee who believes that their job is to determine what the law says as opposed to determining what the law should say.  So we have somebody here who is well prepared, well written, and who has clearly made the case that her job as a judge--or any judge's job--would not be to determine what the law should say based on their view of faith or their view in the world but to look at the law and say: What does the law say?  The Constitution guides the The Congress passes the law. As long as that law meets constitutional principles based on what the Constitution says--not what it should say, but what it says--then, the judge looks at what the law says--not what it should say, in his or her opinion, but what the law does say. So there is no real room for a faith determination there. The only job of the judge is to decide what the law says. The second job, if there is a second job, would be to ensure that it also conforms to what the Constitution says the Congress and the President are allowed to do.  One thing the Congress and the Constitution are not allowed to do is to establish a religious test for public office. Whether Americans have any faith or no faith at all, they should be concerned if we begin to talk about this differently. Even though it was already in the Constitution, the Founders listed freedom of religion as the first freedom in the First No other country has ever set out as one of its foundational principles freedom of religion.  President Jefferson--not known to be the most religious of all of our Presidents and maybe to be the most questioning of religion generally--said in a letter in the last year of his Presidency that of all of the rights that we have, the one we should hold most dear is what we called the right of conscience--the right to believe what your conscience leads you to believe is the right thing to believe. Jefferson said that is the right we should hold most dear. Whether you are Muslim or Jewish or Catholic or Buddhist or any other faith or no faith at all, there is no religious test. For any individual and for all individuals of any faith or all faiths or no faith, religious freedom includes the right of an individual to live, to work, to associate, and, if they choose, to worship in accordance with their beliefs.  The belief that a person's religion would in some way disqualify that person from public service has to be strongly and fully rejected.  There is no other legitimate question raised about this nominee today. So certainly I am pleased to see many of my colleagues come to the floor to talk about this topic. Professor Barrett did receive some bipartisan support on the cloture vote yesterday. One way to demonstrate that there is clearly no objection to a person of faith, who says that faith should never get in the way of the job they do as a judge, is simply to vote for the judge.  I intend to do that today. I urge my colleagues to do that as well. A lifetime appointment to the circuit court of the United States of America is no small obligation. It is no small trust in an individual's capacity to do the job that you ask them to do. All of the nominees--the four circuit nominees whom we will have before us this week--are prepared for these jobs. I wish them happy service and a long and healthy life as they set out on the task that they have agreed to accept, if and when they are confirmed, and this week the Senate will confirm them to these jobs.[[Page S6908]]  I yield the floor.

MASFAP organized in 1967 with a steering committee of five members. Today the association has grown to over 800 members. The observance of MASFAP's 50th anniversary provides an opportunity to recognize the work of Missouri's student financial aid personnel and the association's partnerships and to raise awareness about the affordability of a postsecondary education.  MASFAP is a dynamic association dedicated to serving and advocating for practitioners, users, and providers of student financial aid programs. Most families and students are aware of student financial aid programs because they provide valuable funds to assist in the costs of a postsecondary education, without which many would be unable to achieve their education goals.  As a former high school teacher and university president, I know how fortunate it is for Missouri to have so many great post-secondary education options. With the assistance of student financial aid administrators throughout Missouri, students are learning about the resources available to help them attend one of the great schools of their choice. As a result, students are getting the education and training they need to succeed.

47,topic-id,1049,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Lipinski for yielding and also for[[Page H8377]]organizing this Special Order for the Climate Solutions I also want to thank the founders of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Congressman Ted Deutch from Florida and Congressman Carlos Curbelo also from Florida, where they can see at their doorstep what issues like sea level rise mean to their communities.  Mr.Speaker, I am really pleased to join with my colleagues from the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus this evening to highlight the importance of taking action on climate change, something that matters so much to my constituents at home in Oregon, but also to the country and to the planet.  This is an important issue that really is a moral imperative. This is about preserving our natural resources for our children, our grandchildren, and for generations to come. Addressing climate change is also vital to our Nation's economy, as we have had some discussion about that this evening, and also to national security, but, really, the health of the planet.  Now, the district I am honored to represent out in Oregon is breathtakingly beautiful, and it is really full of potential. The majestic Columbia River is the northern boundary of the district, and the rugged Pacific Ocean is on the western boundary. It has a thriving outdoor recreation economy. As my colleague from New York mentioned, that is an important sector that cares a lot about the changing climate.  I also have in my district the heart of Oregon wine country. People in my district fish. They fish in our rivers, our lakes, and our ocean. They hike in our forests. They ski in our back country and on our mountains. We rely on those natural resources in our backyard to support a significant part of our economy, but we are very vulnerable to the effects of climate change.  My constituents are already experiencing challenges: Our wine and agricultural industries are concerned about drought as global temperatures continue to rise. Coastal communities are worried about the vitality of the commercial fishing and shellfish industries as high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere change ocean chemistry.  I was really thrilled that we had an Oregonian from Oregon State University come to the Climate Solutions Caucus and talk about adapting to ocean acidification.  Our region has faced higher spring and summer temperatures and earlier snowmelt, and, as a result, a snowboard shop in my district is now selling more skateboards and fewer snowboards.  Climate change is not a partisan issue. Nationwide, fishers, farmers, small-business owners, and our servicemen and -women are changing the way they do their jobs because of climate change, regardless of political affiliation.  The economic, health, and environmental consequences of climate change are well known, and our understanding about how to address climate change continues to improve.  People in the United States and around the world are facing threats from rising sea levels, from ocean acidification, from more frequent and severe weather events from record droughts and flooding and rising global temperatures. We can no longer sit back and debate whether we should take action. The time is now. It is critical that we support scientific research about the climate and that we build on, rather than break down, decades' worth of progress on this issue.  Now, one important area of research is the connection between extreme weather events and climate change. Although it is not possible to say that climate change causes one particular extreme weather event, it is critical that we know more about climate change and how it increases the frequency and the severity of these events. Learning more about this correlation can help families, communities, and businesses make informed choices and adopt climate strategies.  Now, this year has seen poignant example after example with so many devastating extreme weather events. We need to do everything we can to make sure our communities are prepared to keep families safe.  We have had wildfires in the Western United States for a long time, but since the mid-1980s, they have been increasing in frequency and in duration, threatening lives, threatening public health and property. It has been unusually hot and very dry in the  Fires and severe smoke create dangerous conditions for all populations. In Portland, Oregon, on Labor Day, the sky was gray, full of smoke from wildfire. This is especially problematic for pregnant women, for seniors, for children, for anyone with chronic health conditions like asthma. Residents and communities miles away from the wildfires saw ash falling on their homes, their cars, and throughout their neighborhoods.  This year's hurricanes have devastated communities, of course, across Texas, across the Southeast, and in the U.islands. About 70 percent of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico are still without power.  These storms are increasing in frequency and severity, and lives are being lost every year.  Mr.Speaker, it is so important that we take action, and that is why I am so pleased to be here today to help highlight the importance of this issue.  As Representative Lipinski noted and others have, Mr.McNerney and others, we can take action to address climate change and grow the economy. It is not an excuse to say this will be bad for the economy, because we can grow those renewable energy industries. There is so much potential in wind power, wave energy, solar energy. Those are good, high-paying, family-wage jobs. We can grow those economies and address climate change at the same time.  Mr.Speaker, addressing climate change is going to save lives; it is going to save property. I am so pleased to be part of this bipartisan group that is working together in equal number of Democrats and Republicans to call attention to this important issue, and I will continue to work with the caucus to emphasize the importance of congressional action.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus for their dedication to this effort. I know it is quite a relief to my constituents back home in Oregon to know that there are bipartisan Members who are committed to addressing this critical issue.  Again, Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their dedication to this effort. I look forward to the progress that we will make together on behalf of our constituents, our communities, our country, and our planet.

634,topic-id,483,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Ruthie and Connie LGBT Elder Americans Act, legislation I am introducing to support our country's LGBT seniors.  The LGBT senior population is growing and is estimated to include nearly 6 million Americans by 2030. Unfortunately, the same generation of LGBT people who fought for rights in the workplace, equal marriage, and societal recognition are once again marginalized as they age.  LGBT seniors have fewer support services, higher poverty rates, more social isolation, and inadequate access to healthcare services compared to the rest of older One of the primary barriers to providing services to LGBT seniors is a basic lack of information.  The Older Americans Act, or OAA, already requires the Administration on Aging to collect data on the individuals receiving OAA services and the efficacy of OAA programs; but if we collected data on sexual orientation and gender identity, we could better understand this population and provide services that best fit their needs.  Unfortunately, the data we do have shows that the poverty rate is higher for LGBT seniors, which is likely because many have faced discrimination while working, they have historically been unable to legally marry, and they have experienced gender and racial inequalities. We also know that LGBT elders are less likely than their peers to have community support and caretakers to help them.  I know from speaking with LGBT seniors that many fear discrimination when receiving home healthcare services. They are twice as likely to be single and four times more likely to not have children. These are complex and important issues that require a personalized solution.  The bill I am introducing today with Colorado Senator Michael Bennet and Florida Representatives Ted Deutch and Charlie Crist would help bridge the gap between LGBT seniors and the services they need.  The bill is named for Ruthie Berman and Connie Kurtz, who sued the New York City Board of Education years ago for domestic partner benefits, and won their landmark case in 1994. In the decades since, Ruthie and Connie have continued their advocacy and fight as champions of LGBT rights.  Our bill would amend the Older Americans Act to improve services for LGBT seniors and require data collection on sexual orientation so better decisions can be made.  Additionally, the bill would permanently establish a National Resource Center on LGBT Aging and provide grants for organizations working to improve LGBT services, including access to healthcare and long-term care. The resource centers and the grants will help States and localities reach out to LGBT older adults and provide culturally competent support.  By requiring specific consideration for LGBT seniors in the Older Americans Act, we can provide needed support to a vulnerable yet overlooked population.[[Page H8301]]  I thank my colleagues for their work on this important issue, and I hope many others will join us in supporting this bill to help our LGBT senior communities.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8300-2.txt,2092,PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are just looking to be paid what they earn, the same as any other worker in this country.  Make no mistake, an attack on public sector unions is an attack on all unions. An attack on unions is an attack on all workers, whether they belong to a union or not, and I mean all workers, whether you punch a timeclock or whether you fill out a timesheet or swipe a badge, whether you make a salary or earn tips, whether you are on payroll, a contract worker,[[Page S6958]]a temp, working behind a desk, cutting hair, working on a factory floor, or working behind a restaurant counter. I mean all workers.  The fact is, all workers across this country--as profits go up, as GDP goes up, as executive compensation goes up, as workers get more productive, all workers across this country are feeling squeezed. Work doesn't pay off the way it used to.  We have seen what happens when workers have no power in the workplace. Increasingly, corporations view American workers as a cost to be minimized instead of a valuable asset in which to invest.  Look at the news we got last month. This piece of news, when I mention this to some of my colleagues, when I mention it around the State of Ohio, peoples' mouths drop. The Bank of America, Merrill Lynch downgraded the fast food restaurant Chipotle because the company pays its workers too much.  Remember what happened with American Airlines a few months ago. American Airlines announced it was doing a companywide pay increase, and the stock market punished them by knocking their stock down. Imagine that. So when a company wants to do the right thing, Wall Street says: No, you are not going to do the right thing. Wall Street is saying: We want all the money. Don't give any of this money to workers--workers making $10 or $12 or $15 an hour. Think about that. Wall Street and Merrill Lynch didn't say they paid their workers too little, they paid their workers too much. That is why the labor movement matters.  Pope Francis spoke about how unions perform ``an essential role for the common good.'' He said that the labor movement ``gives voice to those who have none . . . unmasks the powerful who trample on the rights of the most vulnerable workers, defends the cause of the foreigner, the least, the discarded.''  I just had the pleasure, for the last few minutes in my office, to speak with Bishop Murry of Youngstown, OH, and we were talking about the Pope and about steelworkers in Youngstown and about the struggles of workers and wages and layoffs and all the things that have happened to--where the winds of globalization have buffeted the workers in that community. Bishop Murry, as does Pope Francis, understands what too many in this town don't; that workers feel invisible, entire communities feel invisible. They feel like they are getting used and abused and some other words I can't say on the Senate floor.  What, exactly, is the point of creating economic growth if workers don't share in it, if ordinary families still can't get ahead?  Everybody here loves to talk about tax reform and bring the corporate rate down, but nobody is talking about paying workers more or giving workers more job security or what we should be doing--in working with companies and creating good jobs.  My legislation, the Patriot Corporation Act, says if corporations do the right thing--if they pay their workers well, if they pay benefits, if they do the kinds of things American corporations should do--then they get a lower tax rate because they have earned it.  We seem to have forgotten that all work has dignity. We have forgotten, as the Pope said, that ``the person thrives in work. Labour is the most common form of cooperation that humanity has generated in its history.'' Think about that. ``Labour is the most common form of cooperation that humanity has generated in its history.''  What Washington and Wall Street don't seem to understand is that workers drive our economy, not corporations. You focus on the middle class, you grow the economy from the middle out, not cut taxes on the richest people and expect the money to trickle down into more money in workers' pockets and more people are hired. You grow the economy by treating workers well, by investing in workers. That is why we need unions to ensure that we spread economic growth to the people creating it, to the people working too many hours for too little pay.  I think about workers like Stephanie in She has worked for 25 years as a childcare attendant for students with special needs. She wrote, saying: ``Every day I wake up before the sun rises to prepare for three daily shifts aiding students with special needs on their way to and from school.''  That is the person whom--because she belongs to a union, that is the person whom corporate America, that the rightwing of the Republican Party wants to attack? That is the kind of person--Stephanie in Columbus--they want to attack?  She worries that cases like this that undermine her union ``could severely limit our voice on the job and hurt our ability to best serve the children we care so much about.'' She said: ``Unions provide a pathway to the middle class for all people.''  Think about a janitor I met in I was speaking at a dinner. There was a table down front with seven middle-age women--a pretty diverse group. There was one empty seat at the table. It was told to me by some others that this group of women were janitors, custodians in downtown Cincinnati, southwest Ohio, and these women had signed their first union contract with downtown Cincinnati business owners. So there were 1,200 janitors working in these downtown businesses--in these big buildings downtown--and they had signed their first union contract.  I asked if I could sit at their table, and they said yes. I said to the woman next to me: What is it like to have a union?  She said: I am 51 years old, and this is the first time I will have a 1-week paid vacation in my life.  Think about that. We don't think--I am guessing that most of my colleagues think: Well, you know, people have paid vacations and people have paid sick leave. Well, much of the country doesn't, 1; and 2, those who do often have that because they had a strong union--a union that negotiated sick leave pay for them, a union that negotiated vacation days for them, a union that negotiated family leave for them, and then, when those workers at a company get it, the other nonunionized workers and companies get it, and then those companies compete with other companies.  So the fact is--there is a bumper sticker that says: ``If you enjoy your weekend, thank a labor union.''  Labor unions brought to this country things like weekends and more leisure time and decent pay and all that. That is why unions matter. That is why this decision in the Supreme Court matters.  If the Supreme Court rules against AFSCME, it will starve the union for resources they use to organize and grow and advocate for more workers. At the risk of being disrespectful, it would be nice if those nine members of the Supreme Court would follow the admonishment of Pope Francis, the words of Pope Francis, who admonished his parish priests to go out and smell like the flock. Find out where people live and work. Find out what people do.  Find out the living conditions of people.  Abraham Lincoln in the White House one day was talking to his staff. His staff said: You have to stay here in the White You have to win the war. You have to free the slaves. You have to preserve the  Lincoln said: No, I have to go out and get my public opinion baths.  It could be important if the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court--who has an Ivy league education, went to the best colleges and the best law schools, grew up in a wealthy family, has done very well as a professional, and is a very smart man--if he would go out and smell like the flock, if he would go out and get his public opinion bath, maybe he would hear some stories, as I have heard in my time in the  He would hear stories from people who talk about how important it is that Stephanie has union protection. He probably has never really thought much about the fact that janitors, who have worked 30 years as janitors--35 years for some of those women--but never had a paid day off, never had a paid vacation. He might learn something from them and think a little differently about this.  If the Supreme Court rules against AFSCME, it is the opposite of what we need. We should be making it easier, not harder, for workers to come together and negotiate. That is why, this week, I am introducing legislation to strengthen the National Labor Relations Act, to make it harder for employers to deny workers the freedom to collectively bargain by playing games with their job titles and classifications.[[Page S6959]]Instead of stacking the deck even further in favor of corporate CEOs, we need to make it easier for workers to organize. That is how we make hard work pay off.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

919,topic-id,716,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Encouraging Public Offerings Act, a bill that the gentleman from New York (Mr.Meeks) and I have worked on together, and I thank him for that.  I also thank the Financial Services Committee, in particular, the staff and the subcommittee chairman, Mr. I also thank the chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Hensarling). His leadership of this committee and his devotion and fidelity to the conservative principles are legendary. His retirement will be a great loss to this institution. The Hensarling legacy of conservative leadership will not be forgotten, and I am certain that his next chapter will be as great as this one. He will be missed by all, especially by those of us--myself among them--who share his vision and his limited government principles.  Mr.Speaker, no other country has a better history of connecting money with vision than the United States of We rightfully celebrate our legendary entrepreneurs: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Andrew Carnegie, Tom Davis, John Rockefeller, and a whole host of others who built the companies that drive our economy. None of those men could have done what they did without capital. None of them could have done what they did without intermediaries to connect that capital to their vision.  So, Mr.Speaker, the depressing truth is that our capital markets are the biggest, strongest, and most transparent connectors between money and vision, and they are not where they once were. We have the same number of public offerings on our stock exchanges that we did in the 1980s, when the economy was much smaller. We have lost 50 percent of our public companies since the 1990s, and more and more companies choose to go private, or they never even sell their shares to the public.  The hope is that, with this bill, we will increase the desire of companies to go public, getting our financial markets back to being the number one method for capital formation. To that end, our bill does three things:  First, it allows the companies to file their paperwork for going public with the SEC confidentially. That way, if there is an error or a discrepancy in the documents, the company can work it out with the agency without getting embarrassed in public or exposing information to competitors.  Second, it allows all companies to confidentially file their paperwork for a second stock sale after an initial public offering. Again, the point being to allow for a dialogue between the company and the regulator.  Third, it also allows all companies considering an IPO to talk to sophisticated investors and qualified institutions and see if these investors might want to buy their stock before offering it to the public, which is called ``testing the waters.'' It is hard to know if[[Page H8320]]you should sell a product if you can't check and see if there is anyone out there who even wants to buy it.  Mr.Speaker, these changes to the securities laws have received broad support. I want to quote the SEC chairman on this when he spoke at a hearing in our committee. He said: ``The initial data is positive. Not just people using it, but people saying, Thank you, we intend to use it. Both from an IPO perspective, but also from the perspective on follow-on offerings that occur in the first year . . . if there is any adverse views, I'd like to hear them. We haven't heard any.''  The Center for American Progress, which has not traditionally been friendly to relaxing financial regulations, has said that these reforms, which were made available to smaller companies in the JOBS Act, were some of the most successful provisions in that law. This bill applies them to all companies, not just those with a certain amount of revenue.  Finally, the Treasury Department gave favorable mention to these reforms in its report on the capital markets earlier this year. This bill passed out of the House Financial Services Committee with unanimous support.  Mr.Speaker, the numbers on public companies are clear. We have a problem. The experts are clear that the changes in the Budd-Meeks bill would be a positive step towards fixing the problem. Similar bipartisan reforms have seen great success in the past.

Mr.Speaker, on behalf of millions of seniors in my home State of Texas and all across the United States, I am grateful that the House is considering H.849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017.  This bill has been championed by my good friend from Tennessee, Phil Roe, in this Congress and in previous[[Page H8396]]It accomplishes a very simple task: To repeal the unpopular Independent Payment Advisory Board created under the Affordable Care  This repeal has strong bipartisan support in both the Energy and Commerce Committee, on which I serve, and in this entire body.  As of today, there are 270 Republican and Democratic cosponsors to the bill who all agree that the creation of this board was a very bad idea.  More than 800 organizations representing every State support this bill. If I may add, this includes seniors, patient advocacy groups, physician groups, and other healthcare provider organizations.  This board is charged with broad, sweeping powers to reduce Medicare spending when Medicare spending exceeds an arbitrary target.  The board is a panel composed of 15 members appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate for up to two consecutive 6-year terms. Fewer than half of the Independent Payment Advisory Board members can be healthcare providers, and no one--and this is an important point--on the board may receive outside income. So that means by its very definition that this board is comprised of people who cannot be practicing physicians.  The other members will come from the ranks of think tanks, unions, and academia.  For a panel with so much authority over Medicare spending, there could be little to no clinical expertise amongst the board members.  Is this what Americans really want?  Now, here is some good news. The board has yet to be formed. Hooray for that. According to the 2017 Annual Report on the Boards of Medicare Trustees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Office of the Actuary, the Independent Payment Advisory Board may not be formed until at least 2021, based on the current Medicare spending rate projections.  Well, that is good news to seniors and their doctors and their families, but these projections are just numbers and they can change. In fact, last year the projection was very different, that the Independent Payment Advisory Board would be triggered this year rather than the delay.  The concern of many of us here in the House and hundreds of stakeholders I have heard from is that under the law, the Independent Payment Advisory Board's proposals are required to be implemented by the Secretary of Health and Human Services unless Congress acts by creating its own proposal to achieve the exact same savings or by preventing the automatic implementation process as defined by law.  So what is that process?       The law mandates immediate introduction of legislation      encompassing the Independent Payment Advisory Board proposed      bills in Congress--  Stop and think about that for a minute. That is not a bill introduced by a Member of That is a bill introduced by an outside board. That is a bill introduced by the administration. Let me recapitulate.       The law mandates immediate introduction of legislation      encompassing the Independent Payment Advisory Board proposed      bills in Congress and establishes strict deadlines for      committee and Senate floor consideration, and places limits      on the appropriations process.       While Congress is permitted to modify the type of cuts to      Medicare, it must achieve identical savings amounts to      Medicare spending as contained in the board's plan. The law      bars Congress from changing the Independent Payment Advisory      Board fiscal targets in any other legislation it considers,      and it creates procedures whereby a super majority vote is      required in the Senate to waive this requirement.       If the Independent Payment Advisory Board fails to report      recommendations or never becomes operational, the Secretary      of the Department of Health and Human Services is given the      power to implement the cuts unilaterally.  Well, you might think that, then, of course this would be under judicial or administrative review, but the Independent Payment Advisory Board is exempt from administrative or judicial review.  No matter what your views are on the Affordable Care Act, we should all agree that giving this much power to a panel of unelected and unaccountable officials or a Cabinet Secretary, whoever he or she may be in any administration, giving away this much power is simply bad policy. The House shouldn't be for that.                              {time}  1230  This process is extremely complicated, and maybe that was the intent of the people who wrote the provision creating this board under the Affordable Care  I also fundamentally believe that the Independent Payment Advisory Board infringes on the separation of powers by shifting authority from the legislative to the executive branch. Not only does the creation of this board significantly limit Congress' authority, it eliminates needed transparency from hearings and debate. It eliminates any meaningful opportunity for stakeholder input.  I believe leaving Medicare payment decisions in the hands of those who are unelected and unaccountable, with little congressional oversight, will actually harm seniors' access to quality healthcare.  Congress has played an integral role in shaping policies that best reflect the needs of our districts and our States, and our constituents demand that. That is the reason they sent us here.  Lastly, as a physician, I treasure the doctor-patient relationship. I believe we must do more to honor this relationship and prevent the Federal Government from further eroding this precious commodity.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

447,topic-id,1362,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 601 provides for the consideration of a critical bill to provide health insurance and healthcare to millions of underprivileged children. This package, which includes two separate bills: H.3922, the Community Health And Medical Professional Improves Our Nation, CHAMPION, Act of 2017; and H.3921, the Healthy Kids This was reported out of the Committee on Energy and Commerce after lengthy deliberation and negotiation and a lengthy markup.  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and  The rule adopts an amendment from the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, modified by a second amendment by the same author, combining the two bills into the package on the floor today.  Further, the rule waives all points of order and makes in order no further amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is afforded the customary motion to recommit.  The congressionally appropriated stream of funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program expired at the end of Funding for other important public health programs, such as community health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education, also expired at the end of  While every State that receives Federal funding through these programs continues to have adequate dollars to maintain health insurance for every enrolled child, several States are beginning to exhaust their unspent 2017 funds and redistributed funds from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid With November now upon us, waiting any longer will only put more[[Page H8403]]pressure on those States to begin sending notifications to children and families that they are losing their coverage for those programs; so it is important that we reauthorize funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program and other programs now.  H.3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, will achieve that important task. It is essential to our efforts to ensuring that these programs continue to meet the healthcare needs of children and families who have come to rely upon them.  Today, more than 8 million low-income children across our country depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program for many of their healthcare services. These include routine doctor visits, immunizations, prescription medicines, and dental care. Through flexible, capped allotments to the States, the program has been able to successfully support these children, while providing States with opportunities to tailor their respective programs as best meet the needs of their respective populations.  The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act would extend CHIP for another 5 years, which is the longest extension since its inception in 1996. An extension through fiscal year 2022 will provide financial stability for every State's CHIP program and certainty for those children and their families who are covered. Additionally, ensuring coverage for CHIP-eligible children will make them less likely to have to enroll in Medicaid or  This bill also contains and maintains a provision under the Affordable Care Act that provided 23 percent increased matching for 2 years; then that draws down to an increase of 11.5 percent matching in the third year; and then, finally, provides funding at pre-ACA levels for the final 2 years.  These funding levels will provide the States enough time to plan their budgets before returning to the regular CHIP matching rates, thereby restoring the fiscally responsible Federal-State Medicaid partnership.  While reauthorizing CHIP funding is the primary focal point of this legislation, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act also includes other important provisions relating to our Nation's healthcare. The bill provides a 2-year extension of funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers, community health centers.  One in thirteen individuals nationwide relies upon a community health center to receive healthcare services. The Community Health Center Fund plays an important role in supplementing the services that Federally Qualified Health Centers are able to deliver to underserved communities by providing care to all Americans, regardless of income or ability to pay.  Funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program is also extended for another 2 years.  The legislation includes a 2-year extension of other important health programs, including funding for the National Health Service Corps, Family-to-Family Health Information Centers, the Youth Empowerment Program, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, the Special Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes, and the Special Diabetes Program for American  In addition to the important funding streams addressed in this bill, the Committee on Energy and Commerce incorporated a way to help our Nation's territories in a time of need following recent natural disasters. The bill includes more than $1 billion for the Medicaid programs in both Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin This funding should assist our territories in providing care for their populations who have faced substantial devastation from Hurricanes Irma and  The Medicare funding issue is unique to Puerto Rico and the United States citizens living in the territories. This was a problem that predated the hurricanes, but it was exacerbated by the devastation that the storm brought to the islands. Without a legislative fix from Congress, this will be an ongoing and festering problem until it is properly addressed, and the bill before us today begins to do just that.                              {time}  1300  Additionally, the bill delays the $5 billion in cuts to many of the hospitals across the country from the Affordable Care Act-mandated Medicaid disproportionate share hospital reductions for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. I am sure that many of my colleagues have heard from hospitals in their districts whose ability to remain operational and to continue to provide care could be jeopardized by these payment cuts.  These cuts are offset in future years, adding an additional $6 billion in reductions in fiscal year 2021, 2022, and 2023. This delays but does not fix a problem that ObamaCare created for safety net hospitals. It is one which we will have to revisit, but it delays the cuts that have already been affected by current law and protects these safety net hospitals which provide care to the neediest citizens in our country.  Not only does the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act reauthorize funding for essential health programs, the bill is fully offset. It will not add to the national debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called this a ``responsible health package,'' noting that the $18 billion cost of the bill is fully offset with savings beyond the 10-year budget window.  One of the ways that costs are offset was to alter the qualified health plan grace period so that it would align with State law grace period requirements. This involved changing, in the Affordable Care Act, the grace period for subsidized individuals from 90 days to 30 days unless a State specifically allows otherwise.  It also redirected $6.4 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to help pay for the legislation. This fund is required by law to receive $2.5 billion in annual appropriations which must be used for prevention, wellness, and public health initiatives administered by the Department of Health and Human If Congress--let me say it again--if Congress does not direct these funds toward specific efforts, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to spend the funds however he or she deems fit.  While we are redirecting these taxpayer dollars, the overarching purpose of the funding is still to improve the health and wellness of Americans through existing mechanisms, and community health centers will do just that.  We allow for certain wealthy Medicare beneficiaries with individual incomes of over $500,000 to pay increased premiums in order to offset some of the cost of authorizing these programs. These beneficiaries will be subject to higher premiums, thereby increasing their overall cost, but still their cost will be lower than if they purchased insurance on the exchange.  The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act is a fiscally responsible way to fund some of our Nation's most important public health programs. The bill would ensure continued access to care for children and individuals who rely on the programs for vital healthcare services.  Mr.Speaker, this is a good bill. Mr.Speaker, these offsets are reasonable. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support today's rule and support the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I include in the Record a copy of the CQ News article.                     [From CQ News, 23, 2017]          House Democrats Push To Delay Children's Health Vote                           (By Sandhya Raman)       Democrats do not want a children's health insurance program      bill to come to the floor this week for a vote, said Frank      Pallone Jr., ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce      Committee at a district event broadcast on Facebook Live on            ``The idea is to not have the bill come to the floor this      week,'' said Pallone, emphasizing that Democrats still want      to find a bipartisan compromise and will not accept the      changes to Medicare or Medicaid that Republicans want to use      to fund the coverage. He later added, ``This is supposed to      come up Hopefully, it won't.''       Pallone suggested that the process could be lengthy if the      House passes a partisan bill and the Senate does not act      quickly to pass their bipartisan measure. The two likely      would have to be reconciled through conference negotiations.       ``We're going to just delay this for months, and the end      result could be we don't deal with this until the end of the      year,'' said Pallone, speaking at a community health center.       Democrats disagree with the offsets in House bills to      reauthorize CHIP (HR 3921) and community health centers and      other safety net programs (HR 3922). The CHIP bill's offsets      include increasing premiums for Medicare recipients with      income over $500,000 a year and limiting Medicaid benefits      for lottery winners. In addition, Democrats take issue with      an offset that would bill other insurance before Medicaid for      recipients who use more than one form of coverage.       The offsets for the community health centers include      changes to undermine the 2010 health care law (PL 111-148, PL      111-152) including cutting almost $6.4 billion from the      Prevention and Public Health Fund over 10 years. Republicans      also would allow states to create their own grace periods for      individuals on the exchanges to pay their premiums or use a      default one-month grace period. The current grace period is      three months.       ``If you miss it and you don't pay it, you can't get your      insurance. You've got to re-enroll for the next year,''      Pallone said about the grace period.       ``The problem is that they haven't been willing to give      much on taking this money from the Affordable Care Act or      Medicare, but why do they even have to come out of health      care at all? Why can't we use another vehicle to pay for      it?'' said Pallone, adding, ``Part of that could be cut back      significantly.''       Democrats also object to the way Puerto Rico's Medicaid      funding in the CHIP bill would be addressed.       ``They're still requiring a state match from Puerto Rico,''      said ``The bill funds a little bit, but it's totally      worthless if Puerto Rico has to come up with the match.''       The island does not have money to contribute, Democrats      say.       Earlier this month, Committee Chairman Greg Walden of      Oregon asked his Democratic colleagues to suggest offsets      that may be more amenable than those currently in the bill      that the committee passed. Last week, Walden said in a      statement that he had not received any Democratic offers.       Democrats contend they have put suggestions on the table.       One idea would require drug companies to help seniors      better afford their prescriptions by closing a funding gap,      known as the ``doughnut hole,'' in Medicare coverage.      Currently, seniors have to pick up more costs after a certain      spending threshold until they hit another limit when Medicare      resumes paying for coverage.       ``We've been making offers back. One of the things we said      is make the drug companies pay for the doughnut hole. We      still have a doughnut hole for Medicare Part So if they      pay for the cost of that, that could be used as a payfor,''      said       ``This bill that may go to the floor next week is going      nowhere,'' said Pallone, stating that it would ``be a totally      partisan vote.''       Federal funding for CHIP expired 30. The Centers for      Medicare and Medicaid Services has redistributed unused CHIP      funds to nine states and territories including Arizona,      California, Minnesota, Washington, American Samoa, Guam,      Northern Mariana Islands, U.Virgin Islands and The      funds come from unused CHIP allotments from previous years      and are used to help states that are running low on their      current year funds.

470,topic-id,344,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Madam Speaker, I want to address the issue of the Prevention and Public Health  The bill before us does redirect $8.9 billion for the Prevention and Public Health Fund to support critically important public health programs that expand access to care and improve health outcomes.  The Prevention Fund was established in the Affordable Care Act as mandatory funding for prevention and public health programs to improve health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and public sector healthcare costs.  According to statute, billions of dollars in advanced appropriations are to be used for the broad purpose of supporting programs authorized by the Public Health Service Act for prevention, wellness, and public health activities. However, prevention, wellness, and public health activities are allowable, but no Prevention Fund-specific or generally applicable definitions of these terms are to be found in the Public Health Service Act, the Affordable Care Act, or anywhere else in Federal law.  The Affordable Care Act was not accompanied by committee reports in either The Department of Health and Human Services has not published regulations, guidance, or other information to clarify the Department's views about the types of activities that are within the scope of the Prevention                              {time}  1345  Annual mandatory appropriations, the Prevention Fund, continue in perpetuity. If Congress does not explicitly allocate the funding, then the Secretary of HHS has the authority to spend these dollars without congressional oversight.  This bill takes discretion over some of the--some, not all--some of the Prevention Fund dollars. It takes it away from the executive branch and redirects these dollars to proven public health programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress like community health centers, a program that employs 190,000 people and served over 24 million patients in 2015.  This has been supported in the past in other legislation, most recently in the Cures initiative, where Democrats and Republicans supported the redirecting of funding for the Prevention Fund for the specific purpose of preserving public health.

473,topic-id,885,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I do want to address one of the things that has come up in the discussion, and that is the issue of the language in the underlying bill that supports the citizens, the American citizens in Puerto  There was a problem in Puerto Rico with their Medicare system, the way people were not automatically enrolled as they were in every other State and territory. There was a problem under the Affordable Care Act where they faced a Medicaid funding cliff.  These problems existed prior to the two hurricanes that hit the island, and a request was made to Chairman Walden and me, on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico, to fix these problems prior to the storms coming ashore, and that is what we fixed in the language of this bill.  I might remind this body that, when Hurricane Katrina came ashore around Labor Day of 2005, a similar problem was encountered. Ultimately, the State's share of that FMAP payment was made. It was made with funds from the Deficit Reduction Act, which were allocated on September 30, 2006, over a year later.  The fact is that there are going to be funds available to Puerto Rico to help offset their part, their match of their State's share of the Federal match, but it will likely come through the money that is appropriated for disaster relief. But we are fixing their underlying problem that existed before the hurricanes. If we don't fix it, it continues to be a problem year in and year out, and the American citizens of Puerto Rico are poorly served by that.  So this body is taking that up today, and I am proud of the fact that our subcommittee and our full committee recognize that and provided that relief.

I am writing to thank you for      your leadership on the Championing Healthy Kids Act of 2017      (H.3922) to extend funding for the Children's Health      Insurance Program (CHIP). We strongly support a five-year      extension of CHIP funding, along with the elimination of      reductions in fiscal years (FY) 2018 and 2019 to the Medicaid      disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments.       Texas Health has supported CHIP since its inception, and      the program currently covers 8.9 million children with family      incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits who lack access to      affordable private coverage. The nation's uninsured rate for      children is a record low of 5 percent due in part to Medicaid      and CHIP coverage. While CHIP is authorized by Congress to      operate until October 1, 2019, legislative action is needed      to continue funding beyond FY 2017. Failure to extend CHIP      funding could result in coverage losses for millions of      children and increased financial pressure for states that may      lead to reductions in eligibility and benefits This      legislation safeguards the program by providing for a five-     year extension of funding.       We also certainly appreciate your leadership on delaying      cuts to Medicaid DSH, which took effect on October 1, 2017.      As you know, Medicaid DSH payments support Texas Health's      hospitals in serving north Texas' most vulnerable      individuals--the poor, the elderly, and the disabled.      Congress reduced Medicaid DSH payments in the Affordable Care      Act, reasoning that hospitals would care for fewer uninsured      patients as health coverage expanded. However, the projected      increase in coverage has not been fully realized, and      Congress subsequently delayed the start of the cuts that were      scheduled to begin in FY 2014. As a result, Texas hospitals      will sustain a $148 million cut in vital payments in federal      fiscal year 2018. The cumulative loss for Texas hospitals for      2018 through 2024 is $3.2 billion. Thankfully, H.3922      would eliminate the scheduled Medicaid DSH reductions in      Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019, thus allowing a critical source      of funding to continue for safety net hospitals.       Thank you for your steadfast leadership on addressing these      important programs by supporting H.3922. As Congress moves      forward on these important issues, we appreciate your      continued willingness to work with us to extend funding for      CHIP, eliminate reductions to Medicaid DSH payments, and      safeguard programs critical to hospitals. If we can provide      you or your staff with additional information, please do not      hesitate to contact.           Sincerely,                                               Barclay Berdan,                                   FACHE, Chief Executive Officer,                                           Texas Health  ",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8402.txt,1751,PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2017,2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
474,topic-id,327,"Madam Speaker, I also have a letter from the Children's Hospital Association, which renews the call for bipartisan CHIP extension: ``Children's hospitals thank Congress for its long-term bipartisan commitment to CHIP and for the children it serves. We look forward to working with lawmakers to maintain a strong CHIP program and strengthen healthcare for children in the future.''     Children's Hospitals Renew Call for Bipartisan CHIP Extension       Children's hospitals urge Congress to protect children and      families by passing a bipartisan five-year extension of the      Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as soon as      possible.       We are pleased that members of the House Energy and      Commerce Committee have developed bipartisan CHIP policies      that reflect the needs of children, including a five-year      extension of the program that provides for robust CHIP      funding, and continue important beneficiary protections such      as the Maintenance of Effort provision, funding for[[Page H8410]]     the Pediatric Quality Measures Program, express lane      eligibility, and outreach and enrollment grants. These      policies are also included in the bipartisan Senate proposal      on CHIP, and we thank the committees of jurisdiction in both      chambers for including these crucial policies.       If CHIP funding is not extended soon, CHIP-enrolled      children may become underinsured or uninsured altogether.      CHIP is an important bipartisan health coverage program for      over 6 million low-income children. CHIP builds off of a      strong Medicaid program by providing age-appropriate and      affordable coverage for children who fall above Medicaid      eligibility levels, but lack access to other health coverage      options.       Concerning reports indicate that states are taking steps to      limit programs in order to address the looming funding      shortfall, despite receiving federal redistribution funds. We      urge Congress to act now and avoid potentially disastrous      consequences caused by further delay by enacting a strong,      bipartisan five-year extension of       Children's hospitals thank Congress for its long-term      bipartisan commitment to CHIP and the children it serves. We      look forward to working with lawmakers to maintain a strong      CHIP program and strengthen health care for children into the      future.

I, frankly, do not understand why there is reticence to providing an offset for funding of children's health insurance by income relating to part B premiums for people who earn over $500,000 a year, seniors who earn over $500,000 a year, or a couple who earns over $875,000 a year. This was language that was included in President Obama's budget, so don't tell me it is not bipartisan, because it was bipartisan.  Now, Madam Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of an important piece of legislation to maintain the important funding streams for millions of underprivileged children depending on the program.  I want to thank Chairman Walden for his efforts to continually work with the minority on the Energy and Commerce Committee, repeatedly providing the requested extensions by the ranking member in order to continue discussions on the legislation.

This legislation funds critical, bipartisan health programs that help keep our communities healthy.  Mr.Speaker, I have long been a strong supporter of CHIP because I have seen it in action back in my home State of I served on the Alabama State School Board back when Alabama implemented our CHIP program, known as ALL ALL Kids was the first CHIP program in the country, and it has made a real difference. In fact, the uninsurance rate for children in Alabama has gone from 20 percent pre-CHIP to 2.4 percent today.  For 83,000 Alabama children under 19, the program offers low-cost, comprehensive healthcare coverage that includes regular checkups, immunizations, sick child doctor visits, prescriptions, vision care, dental care, and much more.  CHIP has always been a bipartisan program, and I hope this reauthorization will earn bipartisan support for the children of  This legislation also reauthorizes the community health centers fund. I am a huge champion of community health centers because, again, I have seen them work in Alabama from the Mostellar Medical Center in Bayou La Batre to Franklin Primary Health in Mobile to Southwest Alabama Health Services in These centers are vitally important to so many Americans, but especially to low-income families and those in rural areas.  One in 13 people nationwide rely on a health center for their healthcare needs, and this reauthorization is necessary to ensure those individuals continue to receive access to medical care.  This legislation also includes many other healthcare provisions to meet other priorities. Among these provisions, I am pleased the legislation continues Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, or DSH payments, as they are commonly known.  DSH provides funding to hospitals that treat a large number of indigent patients. DSH is absolutely critical to the life of Alabama's hospitals, and failure to renew these important payments could result in numerous hospital closures in our  So, Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get behind this legislation and ensure it gets across the finish line. We should not let petty political arguments keep us from ensuring that children have access to affordable health insurance, keeping the doors open at community health centers, or allowing Alabama's hospitals to continue serving communities in need.

192,topic-id,241,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. This bill is a commonsense, thoughtful approach to restore our forests and minimize forest fire risk.  First and foremost, I thank Representative Westerman for understanding the need for these vital reforms. He has been a great partner to work with and has a keen understanding of how to restore our forests.  This bill contains a number of needed reforms, but, in particular, H.2936 will put an end to obstructionist litigation that has been paralyzing the ability of the Forest Service to manage their own land for years.  The legislation creates an arbitration pilot program that requires anyone suing to block a forest management activity to produce an alternative solution, providing effective resolutions to problems rather than frivolous litigant activity. The bill also puts a limit on the amount of taxpayer dollars that can go to pay legal fees of obstructionist groups when they sue to stop management.  It seems that every year we have a longer, more devastating fire season. In my home State of California this year, it has been particularly devastating in both lives and land lost. These fires demand that we act, and we need to act now, to fix our forest management.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue.

791,topic-id,269,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to urge the House to approve H.3567, a necessary and long-overdue piece of legislation. This is a straightforward, commonsense bill that authorizes the purchase of a small parcel of Natural Resources Conservation Service property in Riverside, California, by the Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation  Since 1996, the conservation district has partnered with NRCS to acquire, colocate and manage what was previously the USDA Salinity Following acquisition of the property, NRCS has not obligated any Federal funds for plant materials research at the Riverside location in question.

272,topic-id,931,"Mr.President, I rise to give my fifth in a series of speeches addressing what I think will be a monumental achievement of this Senate and House when we pass our tax reform bill.  I have spoken previously about how I believe tax reform will be good in a lot of different ways. First of all, I talked about how this tax reform bill will spur economic growth in our country. Second, I talked about how it would grow jobs in small businesses. Third, I talked about the benefits working-class families will have through policies such as the child tax credit.  So today I rise to talk about the importance of tax simplification. According to a publisher who analyzed the issue, since 1913, the Federal Tax Code is 187 times longer than it was a century ago. On top of the Tax Code itself that spans thousands of pages, there are additional IRS regulations that are complicated, and you need somebody not just to figure them out for you and interpret them for you but to figure out how that translates to your own tax return. Of course, taxpayers have to comply with all of these.  Beyond the code and the regulations, there are countless IRS procedures, technical memorandums, and more, and all of this adds to the length and complexity of our tax system. You can see it when you turn toward the April 15 date, the stress level in this country really rises, and a lot of it has to do with the complications of our tax system.  The point is this, when it comes to figuring out your taxes, it is just far too complex. That is why businesses and individuals spend 6 billion hours a year complying with the Tax That is more than 18 hours for every man, woman, and child in this country. That is equivalent to 3 million people working full time--3 million people working full time to comply with the Tax Code and fill out your tax forms or, another way of looking at it, that is $195 billion in lost productivity.  Again, our Tax Code is just too complicated, and that is also what tax reform is about, simplifying and making it easier for Americans to comply.  According to the Brookings Institution, ``The notion that taxes should be simpler is one of the very few propositions in tax policy that generates almost universal agreement.''[[Page S6977]]  Despite years of bipartisan talks, we are now on the verge of major tax reform for the first time in 30 years. Making our Tax Code simpler will benefit every single working family in this country. By roughly doubling the standard deduction, filing your taxes will be easier and more understandable. The higher standard deduction will let more middle-class Americans benefit from not just lower taxes but also without the hassle of itemizing your tax return. Lower rates and fewer deductions will help all Americans spend less time and energy and worry on tax compliance.  Our goal is for the overwhelming number of Americans to be able to submit their tax forms on a single sheet of paper without all those extra forms, and for many families in West Virginia and around the country who already use the standard deduction, increasing it will reduce their taxes. Now, 83 percent of West Virginians last year--or maybe it was the year before, 2015, 2016--83 percent filed a simple form.  Simplicity in our Tax Code and relief for middle-class families, those are the reasons I offered a straightforward amendment to the Senate's budget resolution. My amendment said Congress should focus on eliminating deductions that primarily benefit wealthier individuals in favor of tax policy that benefits the middle class. Let me say that again. Congress should focus on eliminating deductions that primarily benefit wealthier individuals in favor of tax policy that benefits the middle class. That means a tax code that is simpler with fewer deductions and lower rates.  It will not just be individuals and families who benefit from a less complicated tax code. Tax simplification will help our small businesses start, grow, and succeed. Ninety-five percent of the businesses in my State of West Virginia are small businesses, and they employ over half of West Virginia's private sector workforce. So in addition to their high marginal tax rate, the complexity and compliance cost of their taxes impedes their economic growth, impedes their ability to grow their job, raise their wages, spur growth. A CNBC survey found that 22 percent of small business owners aren't sure what their effective tax rate really is. If Congress can simplify the code just to cut compliance costs in half, that would free up significant resources that could be used to grow the economy. Given that 50 percent of U.job growth has occurred in just 2 percent of our country's counties, we need that growth. Think about that. Over the last several years, 50 percent of the U.job growth has only occurred in 2 percent of our country's counties. We need the rest of the country to be able to enjoy that growth. To do that, we need to help the small businesses that are the major economic drivers in our economy.  Simplifying the Tax Code will benefit so many across this country through GDP growth and higher wages. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make tax reform and tax simplification a reality.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

These nominees are well-qualified individuals who have demonstrated a strong understanding of the proper role that a judge plays in our constitutional system.  I am especially pleased that we are considering three exceptionally talented women for the Federal bench. Federal circuit court nominations are extremely important. Circuit courts sit directly below the Supreme Court in our judicial system. Because the Supreme Court reviews relatively few or a smaller number of cases, many times the circuit courts have the last word in the majority of those cases, so it is essential that we have judges on the circuit court who will treat all litigants fairly.

I think it is really important for everybody to understand that right now in the workings--and it is probably going to come to this floor in just a few days--is the Speaker Ryan-McConnell tax giveaways to big corporations, which will actually increase taxes for working families, working mothers and fathers.  I think it is important for people to understand that this is something that is being sold as a middle-income tax cut.

They have a nuclear weapons capability. They currently have the ability to explode a nuclear device. They are working on delivery systems that could very well reach not just the region but the United They are violating international commitments. They have done dozens of tests this year alone, all in violation of those international commitments.  We have had a strong policy to try to isolate North The United States has led in the imposition of sanctions. We introduced this year and passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions It passed this body by a 98-to-2 vote. I notice the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is on the floor, and he was one of the strong architects of that legislation. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolutions 2270, 2321, and 2375. The President has issued Executive Order 13810.  We have been asking for rigorous enforcement of sanctions. We could do more. One of the points I hope the President will be talking about during his trip is robust and rigorous enforcement of the sanctions that are out there. And I see there is activity taking place in the Banking We have legislation in the Senate Foreign Relations If additional sanction authority is needed, let's do that. That is important.  But what additional things can we do, and what should the President be promoting as he visits Asia? First, let me give you a few unacceptable alternatives.  We cannot lead with military intervention. The casualties could be astronomical. The technology to develop nuclear weapons would still remain. Our allies are certainly not in agreement with that policy. There is no congressional authority for the use of force.  A second alternative that is not acceptable is to just continue the current course. North Korea is developing a delivery system that will threaten not just Japan and the Republic of Korea but also Guam and the United We will see an arms race if we do not effectively stop North Korea's nuclear program.  President Trump's statement, in my view, made the challenges even more dramatic. His ``America first'' statements isolate America and make it more difficult for us to get the type of support we need. I think his reckless statements make it more likely rather than less likely that we will use a military option.  What we need is a surge in diplomacy. A surge in diplomacy can very well start with the meeting between President Xi of China and President Trump of the United We have a[[Page S6989]]common agenda. Neither China nor the United States want to see a nuclear North Both China and the United States recognize that the Kim Jong Un regime in North Korea is unreliable. We are both looking for an off-ramp so we don't need to use a military option.  China has the capacity to turn the pressure on North Korea through sanctions that could change the equation in North China and North Korea have a common agenda. Both want to preserve the regime of Kim Jong Un--Kim Jong Un for obvious reasons; China, because they do not want to see a unified Korean Peninsula under Western influence.  Our objective is for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. China needs to be convinced that our objective is the same as theirs. With that, they could instill greater pressure on North Korea, and diplomacy could work.  What should be our objective? We have to be realistic. In the short term, it should be containment. Freeze the current program. Stop the testing. Make it clear that we cannot allow these programs to continue. Ultimately, we want to see a nonnuclear Korean  We know that in the past--the 1994 framework agreement with North Korea lasted for 8 years. So there is an ability to make progress, but we have to develop confidence between the parties.  In conjunction with this, let me urge us not to lose sight of the North Korean people. Let's continue our focus on the human rights problems in the country. Let's work with our allies, particularly Japan and the Republic of Korea, and let's rigorously enforce the sanctions until progress is made.  We can achieve an alternative outcome in North Korea, but it requires U.leadership, and President Trump needs to engage on that issue. We need confidence building, and we need to make sure that we make progress. Time is not on our side, but there is still time to make progress. Without a diplomatic surge, there are only unacceptable options. Our goal should be a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous northeast Asia community.  I yield the floor.

264,topic-id,1404,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to talk about our system of justice. If we were to walk out from the Senate, out the front door, and across the front of the Capitol directly, we would find ourselves across the street from the U.Supreme  As everyone knows, inscribed across the front of the U.Supreme Court are these words: ``Equal justice under law''--a pretty simple statement about our system of justice, but of course that has a profound meaning in our system.  Hundreds of years ago, Saint Augustine said the following about justice: Without justice what are kingdoms but great bands of robbers.  So we have always had this focus on what justice means. It came into sharper focus, of course, when our Nation was born. We set up three branches of government--or, I should say, our Founders set up three branches of government--one of them being the judiciary and, of course, that was followed, after the Constitution was ratified, by the Judiciary Act of 1789. We have had that system of justice in one form other another all these years.  In so many ways, our system of justice sets us apart from the world. Our[[Page S6932]]system of justice, though it is often strained and stretched and sometimes undermined, is still the envy of the world. It does set us apart. We know that throughout our history--and even more recently--there are several examples of one judge being able to stop the executive, one judge being able to reverse policy or, at least, force the executive to make amendments to an Executive order, as has happened over the last couple of months.  I think we always have to ask ourselves whether or not our system of justice is getting it right, whether or not the balance is there. There are lots of ways to express the tension between one side and another in our system of justice. One way to express it--not the only way, but one way, when you consider the awesome appropriate power in a nation like ours--is, Will we have a system that allows everyone to get a fair shot at justice, to literally fulfill the obligation or the goal of equal justice under the law? Or will we have a system of justice that rewards, supports, or seems to find in favor of corporate interests or have a court, whether it is the Supreme Court or a Federal court of one kind or another, that is beholden to corporate interests? So one way to suggest the tension and sometimes the conflict is to have a fair shot for everyone versus a corporate tilt or a corporate court or a corporate justice system.  I would have to say that when you look at some of the evidence most recently, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Roberts has been an ever more reliable ally to both big corporations and those with great power, those with great wealth. A major study published by the Minnesota Law Review in 2013 found that the four conservative Justices currently sitting on the Court--Justices Alito, Roberts, Thomas, and Kennedy--are among the six most business friendly Supreme Court Justices since 1946. So found the major study in the Minnesota Law Review just 4 years ago. So four Justices on the Court now were found among the six most business friendly. That is one indicator.  Another review by the Constitutional Accountability Center, which, of course, is ongoing as decisions are handed down, shows the consequences of the Court's corporate tilt, finding that the Chamber of Commerce has had a success rate of 70 percent--7-0, a success rate of 70 percent--in cases before the Roberts Court, a significant increase over previous So these are two major indicators of the corporate tilt of this Supreme  Now, these cases are important to every person--cases involving, for example, rules for consumer contracts, challenges to regulations ensuring fair pay and labor standards, attempts by consumers to hold companies accountable for product safety and much, much more. Because the Supreme Court's decisions set precedents followed by every Federal district court across the Nation--hundreds of district courts--these rulings have an impact beyond just the particular case and the particular parties or the litigants in that case, in that district, or in that Supreme Court case.  The tilt toward corporate interests at the expense of everyday Americans is not confined to the Supreme I have had serious concerns about many of the judicial nominees put forward by the Trump administration, particularly those nominated to sit on the circuit courts, the highest appellate court in the land other than the Supreme In essence, these circuit courts, which sometimes cover more than one State, are effectively the highest court in the land for the vast majority of cases that are not heard by the Supreme The Supreme Court may take only a few cases a year, sometimes a very low percentage, or less than 5 percent in most years.  The President has plucked many of these nominees for the circuit courts from a list compiled by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, two substantial conservative organizations. I don't want the Supreme Court chosen by the Federalist Society and the Heritage I certainly don't want circuit court judges chosen, handpicked, and designated ahead of time who only have been selected from this list. That is apparently what happened in the midst of the campaign. They gave the Republican nominee a list and said: That is your list. You choose from them only. It wasn't a suggested list. It was a directive.  I think I am joined by a lot of people across the country in my concern when groups like that have veto power over who sits on the Supreme Court or who has veto power over those who sit on Federal courts.  Like several of the conservative Justices on the Supreme Court, many of these nominees on this list from the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation have a corporate philosophy, a philosophy that ignores the realities faced by many Americans, the realities faced by many workers across our country.  The records of these nominees indicate that this problem will only be exacerbated and workers and their families will continue to have the deck stacked against them in the real world, not the world of briefs and the world of Supreme Court juris prudence and the world of arguments in front of the Supreme But in the real world, the decks will be stacked against them--in the real world of making ends meet in a family, in the struggles that people have every day, and in the real world of working every day for long hours and sometimes in not the best working conditions and up against very powerful forces.  The fundamental promise of our court system is this principle of justice I talked about earlier--the principle that everyone should have a fair shot at justice, all the time, in every case, without exception, in every court, in every year, in every era. That is what equal justice under the law means, and when that doesn't happen, when someone is denied equal justice under the law even one time, of course, our system hasn't worked well.  When you see the numbers that I cited earlier, that the Chamber of Commerce has a success rate of 70 percent, I am not sure we can say that equal justice under the law--that principle--has been adhered to. When that happens, of course, what Saint Augustine reminded us hundreds of year ago--that without justice, what are kingdoms but a great band of robbers--people are robbed of justice in maybe one case. Unfortunately we know from the record that it is a lot more than one case. But one is too many if you believe in equal justice under law.  So I have serious concerns that this basic promise--the ultimate promise of justice that was enshrined in our Constitution by our Founders and was brought forward by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and which has continued to this present day--of equal justice under law could be in jeopardy. Some would say that it is in jeopardy already as this administration puts its stamp on the judiciary.  We must demand that the judiciary live up to the principles of equal justice under the law for all the people in all the cases all the time.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Strange).

518,topic-id,617,"Mr.President, 40 years ago, the U.Supreme Court ruled that nonunion public workers who benefit from the work conducted by a union to negotiate contracts that they benefit from should have to pay a fee to cover costs associated with this work. If all workers benefit, it is only right that everyone contributes a fair-share fee.  However, in recent years, there has been a well-funded effort by special interest groups backed by corporate billionaires to dismantle unions and silence the voice of workers. There have been a number of attempts to overturn the 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of Other efforts have targeted State legislatures where they have had success in many In other States like Pennsylvania, these efforts were blocked.  Workers already have the right to decide whether to join a union. They have the right to decide. It is common sense that if these workers benefit from the higher wages and better working conditions that result from contract negotiations undertaken by the union, that those workers should have to chip in for the cost of these negotiations. That is just fair. These negotiations get results and they benefit workers. They benefit workers who are in the union and benefit workers who are not in the union.  The right to bargain collectively has been an integral part of raising income and growing the middle class over the course of the last century. Being able to organize and bargain collectively allows workers to demand higher wages and salaries and of course boost their incomes. These workers have more money to provide for their families, to increase consumption, which in turn increases both production and employment. Putting more money in the hands of workers is good for workers and for the country.  Over the last several decades, we have seen the balance of power across our Nation tilt more and more in favor of the wealthy and the largest corporate interests at the expense of working  The Supreme Court has not been immune from this trend. Under Chief Justice Roberts, the Court has become an ever more reliable ally for big corporations. A major study published in the Minnesota Law Review in 2013 found that the four conservative Justices currently sitting on the Court--Justices Alito, Roberts, Thomas, and Kennedy--are among the six most business-friendly Supreme Court Justices since 1946. So four of the six most business-friendly are serving on the Court at the same time.  A review by the Constitutional Accountability Center--which is an ongoing review and is updated with every case the Supreme Court decides--shows the consequences of the Court's corporate tilt, finding that the chamber of commerce has had a success rate of 70 percent in cases before the Roberts' Court--a significant increase over previous courts.  These are all critical cases. These are cases of critical importance to everyday These are cases involving, for example, rules for consumer contracts, challenges to regulations ensuring fair pay and labor standards, attempts by consumers to hold companies accountable for product safety, and much more.  Well-funded corporate special interests do not have the best interests of working families at heart. They are pushing these efforts to reduce their bottom line by reducing the incomes of working families.  That is why we are standing today to make sure that the voice of working Pennsylvanians and Americans are heard. To increase incomes and strengthen the middle class, we need to[[Page S6957]]stop the assault on workers and labor unions, whether it happens in Congress or in State legislatures or, indeed, in the U.Supreme  I yield the floor.

190,topic-id,364,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Mr.Newhouse, from the Rules Committee, as well as Mr.Westerman, for their work on this bill.  I rise in support, Mr.Speaker, of the rule for consideration of H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act, a bill that will help address the wildfire crisis that is plaguing our Nation as well as begin the very important process of restoring the health of our forests.  As you know, Mr.Speaker, this has been one of the largest wildfire years in our Nation's history. We have seen livelihoods across the West threatened and seen the lives of our brave firefighters put in harm's way. These fires are deadly, and, tragically, more than 40 people lost their lives when fast-moving wildfires swept through northern California just a few weeks ago.  Mr.Speaker, we have particularly felt the effects in my State of Wyoming, where we find ourselves in an absolutely indefensible situation. Fires are being caused and worsened by Federal mismanagement. Eight years of Federal policy opposing proven methods of forest management and, instead, focusing on efforts to prevent all human use of our forests have done significant damage.  This damage is not just to the forests that we have had to watch burn, Mr.Speaker, but we have also seen tremendous damage to our water in postfire situations where the water is contaminated with ash; significant damage to wildlife habitat, the health of our forests, to property, and, most importantly, Mr.Speaker, to human life.  Under the bad policies and the mismanagement from the Federal Government, we have seen our forests become overgrown, accumulating unsafe levels of hazardous biofuels that have become an absolute tinderbox for these fires. We must take action now.  This bill, as my colleagues have pointed out, is a bipartisan effort to begin to take the steps we know will help reduce hazardous fuels and improve the management of our forests. We must also act, Mr.Speaker, as a Congress, to fix the fire-borrowing issue. The Resilient Federal Forests Act takes a significant step toward ending the practice of fire borrowing, and simplifies the process for implementing proper, effective forest management strategies.  Mr.Speaker, I urge, therefore, the adoption of the rule and the underlying bill.

324,topic-id,793,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the Government of Ethiopia's continued pattern of repression and violence against its own people, and I urge the House of Representatives to vote on 128, the Supporting Respect for Human Rights and Encouraging Inclusive Governance in Ethiopia resolution.  This resolution calls on the Government of Ethiopia to take clear, decisive steps towards becoming more inclusive, more democratic, and more respectful of the basic human rights of its own people.  This resolution has overwhelming bipartisan support, with more than 70 cosponsors, and it passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously on July 27.  The ongoing human rights crisis in Ethiopia is extremely troubling to me, to the resolution's other cosponsors, the many Americans of Ethiopian heritage, and too numerous to list human rights groups. I firmly believe that the passage of this resolution will encourage the Ethiopian Government to end its practice of violence and repression and provide a strong basis for an inclusive government.  Specifically, this resolution condemns the excessive use of force by Ethiopian security forces and the killing of peaceful protestors; the arrests and detention of journalists, students, activists, and political leaders; and the Ethiopian Government's abuse of the anti-terrorism proclamation to stifle political and civil dissent.  The resolution does not simply highlight the Ethiopian Government's increasingly authoritarian acts, but it also encourages the United States to support efforts to improve democracy and governance in  I believe that the United States can take actions that will positively influence the Ethiopian Government and use our existing institutions to further democracy and effective governance in  Critically, the resolution calls on the Ethiopian Government to admit U.human rights observers so they can conduct an independent and thorough examination of the current state of human rights in  On March 9 of this year, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations held a hearing to discuss specific steps the United States can take to bring about positive changes for the Ethiopian Government and their people.  Among those who testified was Deacon Yoseph Tafari of the Mary's Ethiopian Orthodox Church located in Aurora, Deacon Yoseph was raised in Ethiopia and has experienced the daily struggles too many Ethiopians have faced living in abject poverty under an oppressive government.  Deacon Yoseph fled from Ethiopia in 1976 and came to the United States as a refugee. He and many of the members of the Ethiopian community in my congressional district of Colorado, including the Oromo and Amharas, have worked diligently to organize and assist those still suffering from repression in their home country.  Oromo community president of Colorado, Jamal Said, has also shared his concerns with me, and both of these gentlemen have no motives other than a concern about the safety and state of democracy in I appreciate their leadership in the community as they continue to fight for democracy in their homeland.  Unfortunately, stories like this are not uncommon in my district, and I am disappointed that the House has not yet scheduled a floor vote on 128. I note that on two prior occasions a vote was tentatively scheduled. In both of these instances, it is my understanding that the vote was postponed due to pressure from the Ethiopian Government, which continues to make promises to curb human rights abuses against their own people, but fail to deliver.  Additionally, it has been brought to my attention that the Ethiopian Government has threatened to cut off security cooperation with United States should we proceed with 128.  I am particularly dismayed that rather than solving their problems and moving towards becoming a more democratic country, the Ethiopian Government has chosen instead to hire a D.lobbying firm at a cost of $150,000 a month to ``work with the Ethiopian Government to develop and execute a public affairs plan to enhance the dialogue and relationships with policymakers, media, opinion leaders, and business leaders,'' in addition to ``meetings with Members of Congress, their staffs, and executive branch officials.''  The issue the Ethiopian Government needs to address is the repression of democracy and its citizens in The solution to whatever negative perception it has in the Halls of the U.Congress is not a public affairs one, but, rather, what concrete steps are being taken against democracy in  That is why I remain committed to working with House leadership to have a vote scheduled on 128.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage leadership to schedule a vote, and I call on my colleagues to vote in favor of and pass 128.

336,topic-id,801,"Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, we had the holiday of Halloween, and a character came to my house with paint all over their face, and I thought they were the musical group Well, they weren't.  They were the Trump administration, disguised as the Trump administration is, and with the simple logo of KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. That is what the Trump administration's attempts are to the American people.  The previous speaker made some comments about regulations and said that the Obama administration wanted to stop Second Amendment advocates from getting guns, arbitrarily, for Social Security recipients. Well, that sounds good. It is simple. Keep it simple.  Well, they weren't Social Security recipients. They were Social Security recipients who had been declared incompetent to manage their own affairs. That is who they said shouldn't get guns, not Social Security recipients.  The previous speaker said something about abortion provider Planned Parenthood getting their funds cut off. Planned Parenthood does most of their work outside of the arena of abortion. Mostly, they do women's basic health services, and by cutting that off, they are hurting women, particularly in my community and other communities where poor people often get their healthcare, their women's care, from Planned Parenthood, and they are depriving them of that healthcare.  Just yesterday, in the subcommittee of which I am the ranking member, we had a hearing on changing Roe v. They called it the Heartbeat bill. In reality, it is destruction of women's right to choose, a fundamental right established in Roe v. Wade, and an unconstitutional bill that could limit the right of a woman to have an abortion as early as 6 weeks, while right now it is 20 to 24 weeks, the period of viability.  They brought a sonogram in and showed a sonogram on the monitor. What they didn't do when they talked about their ``culture of death'' was bring in any lifesaving equipment that[[Page H8392]]will not be available when they cut $1 billion from Medicaid and $500 million from Medicare in their tax proposal, when they put 23 million people off of healthcare, the Affordable Care Act, which is what they tried to do but couldn't accomplish.  It is difficult to sit here and watch what is happening to our country. Having the Trump administration tell the middle class they are going to get a tax cut on the one hand, but on the other hand, they are creating over a trillion dollars in debt, where is that debt going to come from? It is going to come from programs that the middle class will have to give up, so they will be net losers.  One of the main thrusts of their tax proposal is to eliminate the State tax, originally to do it immediately. Now they are talking about maybe phasing it out over 5 or 6 years. That will cost the Federal budget $290 billion. That will come from Pell grants that give people the opportunity to go to college and not have a terrible debt over their heads when they leave; from SNAP payments that give nutritional benefits to people that otherwise would go without, the families that would go without food and proper nutritional benefits; and even LIHEAP, which gives help with heating bills to people who can't afford it in difficult winter conditions.  What they are proposing is not a middle class tax cut. It is a cut for the wealthiest in our country, and that is who will get the benefits. That is who they are about.  Their whole program is KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. That is the only way they can try to sell their wealthy tax break, their aims to prevent women from getting proper healthcare, and their attacks on women in general.  It is unfortunate what we see, what we saw earlier this week in the indictments handed out to Mr.Manafort, Mr.Gates, and the guilty plea of Mr.Individuals involved with the campaign and the administration have not been the best, as they were supposed to be. In fact, they are suspected of criminal behavior, and one has admitted to it.  Our democracy is at risk, and I fear what could happen to it. That is why I introduced an amendment to the Constitution to limit the President's pardon power so he couldn't pardon himself, members of his family, members of his administration, or paid members of his campaign staff.  He has already pardoned Joe Arpaio, and he has threatened to use that power in furtherance as he discussed the possibility of pardoning himself. If he does so, any of these pardons, it will be a test of our democracy, and it will be a test of my colleagues on the other side.

534,topic-id,423,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of a constitutional amendment I have introduced today to prevent the President of the United States, or any future President of the United States, from pardoning himself or herself, members of their family, members of their administration, or members of their Presidential campaign.  Monday's indictment of President Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and guilty plea of another campaign staff member demonstrate how important it is for Congress to act.  The pardon power is supposed to be a safety valve against injustice, a vestige from when we were part of Britain and the King had this power. We are no longer part of Britain, and that power should not be as complete as it is. It is not supposed to be a way for Presidents to put themselves, their families, and members of their administration and their campaign team above the law, to obstruct justice if there is an investigation of wrongdoing.  Unless we change the Constitution, this is how it can be used and may be used. We should stop this conflict of interest from ever arising.  There are already serious questions swirling around the current President, his family, and members of his administration and his campaign staff, including possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 Presidential election currently being investigated by special counsel Robert To ensure that everyone is treated equally under the law, we need to amend the Constitution to narrow the scope of the pardon power.  For some who may say this is only because of the current President, I would say: I objected to the pardon of the brother of a President in the past; in 1977, I proposed changing the pardon power in Tennessee through a constitutional convention item that would have said four Supreme Court Justices could disapprove of a gubernatorial pardon; and I also proposed in 2007, in this Congress, a change in the pardon power with the Supreme Court of our United States where a vote of six members could veto a pardon.  The pardon power is a vestige of a day gone by. It is not something that we should have complete and total ability of the President to use to pardon whomever and whatever he pleases and to obstruct justice.  I ask my fellow Members to join me in this amendment to protect America, to see that our Constitution is current and reflects our values, and to not be complicit in any activities that this President may use with the pardon power to free up wrongdoers.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-31-pt1-PgH8278.txt,,COLLEGES NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT,2017,31,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
885,topic-id,585,"Mr.Speaker, today is the last day of baseball, but, more importantly, it is the first day of open enrollment for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  This year, enrollment only runs from November 1, today, through December 15. This is half the length of last year when open enrollment extended until January 30. It is 6 weeks shorter, so to sign up, get started today. You only have 45 days to do it. This is something the Trump administration is doing to[[Page H8306]]make it more difficult and less likely people will sign up.  Don't let them do this. Sign up for your healthcare. During this shortened enrollment period, there will also be 12-hour periods of scheduled maintenance when the website will be inaccessible. These periods will occur every Sunday morning, except one, during the open enrollment period. December 15 is the last chance for individuals to sign up for health insurance for 2018, unless you have a major event like getting married, having a child, or moving.  In previous years, individuals were notified of autoenrollment with time to change their choice. This year, that happens on December 16, a day after open enrollment ends, so there is no reason to do it. It just tells you what you have got, and you don't have the opportunity to change. So individuals should not rely on autoenrollment. They should use healthcare.gov to find the best plan for them and their families.  In many cases, there are affordable plans. In 2018, in Tennessee, 88 percent can find a bronze plan for under $75.                              {time}  1115  In Memphis, many consumers earning $30,000 to $48,000 a year can find silver plans for under $100. This is particularly true for those in their late forties to age 64.  You may qualify for premiums and cost-sharing reductions like in past years. In 2016, 88 percent of Tennesseans on the exchanges received premium assistance, and 58 percent received cost-sharing reduction subsidies.  This is still true even as the President attempts to sabotage the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Marketing funding and funds for navigators to help people through the process have both been slashed. In spite of that fact, we are going to try to find some navigators still around and have a townhall in Memphis possibly Saturday, November 11. We are still in the process of scheduling that, but we want all of our people to get that chance. So we encourage all Americans to get that chance.  Cost-sharing reduction subsidies will be available for individuals who qualify for silver plans despite Trump's decision to stop the government from reimbursing insurers.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. All current efforts to repeal and replace have failed because they have not come up with a better plan. Healthcare is difficult, and we came up with a plan that needs some tweaking but not repealing.  Memphis has recently seen a decrease in the disparity of breast cancer mortality rates between Black and White women, a clear indication that access to affordable care saves lives.  Memphis has done excellent work at expanding access to screenings and coverage. In addition to local efforts, the Affordable Care Act has helped to reduce or even eliminate copayments that women have to pay for preventive screenings, including mammograms.  Access to affordable healthcare has saved lives in Memphis and throughout this country. The open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act starts today and runs through December 15. Avail yourselves of those opportunities.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8305-2.txt,,COLLEGES NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT,2017,1,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

280,topic-id,856,"Mr.President, today I rise with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Heinrich, to discuss the Securing America's Voting Equipment Act of 2017, or the SAVE Act, which we introduced earlier this week.  I know that you are well aware that the Senate Intelligence Committee has been conducting an in-depth investigation into attempts by the Russians to interfere with our elections last fall. What we have found is that the Russians' active measures preceded last fall, and they continue to this very day.  We have an election coming up in November of this year and a major election next year, and both Senator Heinrich and I believe that it is so important that we act to assist States in protecting the integrity of their voting systems.  Our bill seeks to facilitate information sharing on the threats posed to State election systems by foreign adversaries, to provide guidance to States on how to protect their systems against nefarious activity, and, for States that choose to do so, to allow them to access some Federal grant money to implement best practices to protect their systems.  Let me be clear that I know of no evidence to date that actual vote tabulations were manipulated in any State in the elections last fall. Nevertheless, as early as the summer of 2016, the FBI discovered that foreign-based hackers had gained access to voter registration databases in two The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Russia-linked actors attempted to access voter rolls and registration data in those two  More alarming is that further investigation revealed that many more States than just two were ultimately found to have had their voting systems probed by the The Department of Homeland Security notified election officials in a total of 21 States that their election systems had been targeted by Russian Government-linked hackers.  If voter rolls were altered or voting equipment tampered with, a compromise of these systems could open the door to voter disenfranchisement and would undermine public confidence and the integrity of our free and fair elections--a bedrock principle of our democracy.  In response to these alarming threats, the SAVE Act would assist States in hardening their systems. It does not aim to tell States how to conduct their elections. The responsibility for conducting elections would remain with each State, as has been our country's tradition since its founding. State and local election officials alone, however, cannot be expected to defend against cyber attacks from foreign adversaries. That is why our bill seeks to bring to bear the unique authorities, capabilities, and resources that the Federal Government can offer to State and local election officials.  Let me briefly describe the Heinrich-Collins bill.  First, our bill would codify a decision made by both Secretaries of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson and John Kelly, to designate election systems as ``critical infrastructure.'' This designation allows DHS to prioritize providing assistance to election jurisdictions and to establish formal mechanisms to enhance information sharing and collaboration within the electoral sector. More than 30 States took advantage of DHS's offer of assistance last year.  Our bill also addresses a shortcoming that I raised during a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June regarding foreign efforts to compromise American voting systems. During this hearing, we learned that not a single secretary of state had been cleared to receive classified information before the 2016 election or in the 6 months since voting systems had been declared as critical infrastructure. This delay is truly inexplicable. We have to be able to share this critical information in order for State election officials to take the necessary steps to safeguard their systems.  Our bill addresses this limitation on information sharing by authorizing the Director of National Intelligence to provide security clearances to designated chief election officials in each That way, the intelligence community can share appropriate classified information with States regarding foreign threats targeting election systems.  Our bill also mandates that DHS conduct a threat assessment on physical and electronic risks to voting systems. Then, in collaboration with stakeholders, the Department will develop best practices to address those risks.  A few simple measures can make a big difference. Best practices like relying upon paper ballots, as the State of Maine currently does, and conducting postelection audits to ensure that the tabulation by vote-counting machines matches the results of the paper ballots can bolster both resilience and public confidence in the integrity of the voting process.  Finally, our bill creates a Federal grant program available for States to upgrade and safeguard the integrity of their systems by implementing the best practices that have been identified.  Last year, the Russian Government sought to disrupt our democracy by threatening the integrity of our elections. It is incumbent upon Congress to[[Page S6980]]assist the States and those charged with conducting elections at the local, State, and Federal level to protect them from foreign interference. Our bill would do just that.  I am very pleased to work with the leader on this effort, Senator Heinrich, and I would urge all of our colleagues to join Senator Heinrich and me in sponsoring this bill.

627,topic-id,365,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.3279, the Helium Extraction Act of 2017. This straightforward piece of legislation will incentivize helium production on Federal lands, help ensure the future of America's helium supply, and provide a fair return to the taxpayer.  Under existing law, the Mineral Leasing Act only permits helium extraction as a by-product of an existing oil or natural gas lease. As a result, if oil and gas production on a Federal site is not economically viable, the lease will expire, regardless of the revenue brought in by helium sales. The Helium Extraction Act of 2017 would correct this error and authorize helium production activities where economically viable.  Helium is used for much more than balloons. It is a rare and unique element which has become an indispensable part of our medical, space, and defense industries, such as its use in MRI machines, semiconductors, and air-to-air missile guidance systems.  Unfortunately, the future of our domestic helium supply is uncertain. The Helium Stewardship Act of 2013, which details a commonsense privatization process of the Federal helium reserve, also specifies that all helium in the Federal reserve must be auctioned off by September 30, 2021, and the facility closed.  This crucial source of helium has been relied upon for almost half a century, but in a few short years, it will no longer be available. Our country needs another way to access this critical natural resource; otherwise, we will be relying on hostile interests such as Qatar, Algeria, and Each of these countries presents security and geopolitical challenges made even more apparent by recent unrest among Qatar and its regional neighbors.  Unless something changes, foreign facilities are predicted to become our chief source of helium by the end of the decade. This is why H.3279 is such a necessary piece of legislation.  By authorizing the Bureau of Land Management to lease land for this valuable nonrenewable resource, this legislation will raise $9 million for the American taxpayer and help secure our supply of helium for years to come.  Mr.Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

The National Park Service conservation advocates continued to seek expansion of the boundaries, and five subsequent laws increased the size of the national lakeshore to more than 15,000 acres.

111,topic-id,1789,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to join several of my colleagues in raising concerns about nominations to the Federal judiciary and the Senate's role in carrying out its constitutional advice and consent responsibilities. From my vantage point as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I can see all too clearly that an alarming trend of more and more extreme judicial candidates appearing before us is growing, that more extreme judicial candidates are being nominated, and that the safeguards here in the Senate that are important to our vetting process are being threatened.  Let me start by giving a simple overview of what has happened, first in terms of the speed at which we are considering critical lifetime appointments to some of the most central courts in our whole Federal judicial system.  Just this week, my Republican colleagues have brought forward four circuit court nominees--four nominees in one week--beginning to end. That is more than the number of circuit court nominees than were confirmed in the entire first year of President Obama's  More important to me than the speed is the quality of our process of reviewing these important nominations. The[[Page S6993]]American Bar Association has issued unanimous ``not qualified'' ratings for two current judicial nominees. That hasn't happened in over a decade--since 2006. The American Bar Association is not a partisan or a political group. Founded in 1878, the ABA is a national professional organization with over 400,000 attorney members. The ABA's uncontroversial objectives are to serve its members, improve the legal profession, enhance diversity, and advance and secure the rule of law in our Its contributions to the legal profession are significant. It is the ABA that accredits law schools and establishes model ethical codes.  Additionally, since 1953, when President Eisenhower invited the ABA to provide specific, timely input on candidates for Federal judgeships, the ABA has evaluated nominees for professional competence, integrity, and judicial temperament. This is a rigorous process that involves collecting impartial, peer-review evaluations of candidates.  It is startling that less than a year into this administration, two nominees have already received ``not qualified'' ratings from the ABA, and two more nominees are under consideration of what is called a second evaluator. This is concerning. You see, the ABA does not take giving a ``not qualified'' rating lightly. Any time an evaluator is considering recommending ``not qualified,'' a second evaluator is brought in to conduct an independent review. I believe all nominees to lifetime article III appointments on the Federal bench should have the competence, integrity, and temperament to do the important work that Federal judges are called on to perform.  The nominees we are seeing not only raise concerns about professional qualifications and the speed with which they have been processed. Many of the President's recent candidates are notable for their polarizing, divisive, even offensive rhetoric, rather than the depth of their legal experience or the quality of their judicial temperament. I will give just a few selections from a broad range.  We have recently considered candidates on the Judiciary Committee who had blogged at length in support for birtherism, the discredited and untrue conspiracy theory that suggested that our immediate past President wasn't born in the United Another suggested that ``Mama Pelosi'' should be ``gagged.'' Another called Supreme Court Justice Kennedy a ``judicial prostitute,'' compared abortion to slavery, complained that Americans overreacted to Sandy Hook, repeated anti-gay slurs, and said transgender children are proof that ``Satan's plan is working.'' Many alarming, even extreme comments are in the records of folks brought forward for confirmation--a startling number of them.  Frankly, this isn't about party allegiance--being a Republican or a Democrat, being a conservative or a liberal. This is about having the judgment and the temperament to be a Federal judge.  The mechanisms we have for completely evaluating nominees are today being strained. The American Bar Association has been cut out of some of the White House's efforts, its prenomination vetting process. That means that when the ABA conducts an evaluation and seeks feedback from a candidate's peers, they discover the nomination has already been announced by the White The candidate has already been chosen. Understandably, lawyers are reluctant to provide candid feedback when they know a potential judge has already been nominated. Additionally, it is concerning that we have had hearings in the Judiciary Committee before the ABA rating process is completed. When that happens, it prevents the ABA, our professional organization of attorneys, from being called to testify to explain a ``not qualified'' rating at a hearing where a nominee is considered. In fact, just earlier today, we had two judicial nominees listed on our agenda who do not yet have an ABA rating.  I am not suggesting that every Senator needs to vote in lockstep with the ABA rating, but I feel strongly that the ABA's evaluation must be available to Senators before they are asked to vote on a nominee for a lifetime position as a Federal judge.  Another tool that is under attack that is a century-old tradition of the Judiciary Committee is the so-called blue slip. This is a practice that allows the two home-State Senators to give a positive or negative recommendation on a nominee before they receive a hearing and are considered for lifetime tenure. It allows each Senator to approve the judicial nominations for vacancies in their home States or in the circuit courts where a seat is traditionally associated with that home By requiring that blue slips be returned before a nominee is considered, each Senator is afforded the courtesy to evaluate whether a judicial nominee will meet the needs of his or her constituents and the priorities and values of their home It is an important tool for ensuring that the White House of either party consults with Senators about the judicial candidates the President is considering for nomination. In the end, this tool promotes consensus candidates by ensuring all Senators' views are taken into account, without respect to partisan registration.  As a Senator from Delaware--a State with two current judicial vacancies in one of the busiest district courts in America, which only has four active judgeships--I have been focused on working collaboratively with the White House in a productive manner that ensures that my State gets qualified consensus nominees from the White I am pleased to report that Senator Carper and I have had a very positive experience so far working with the White House on these potential nominations, and it is my hope that we will soon see nominees I can support without reservation. But the blue slip process ensures that this consultative, constructive experience is the rule, not the exception. It is unfortunate that this blue slip practice--this century-old tradition of the Judiciary Committee--is under sustained attack. I believe we should maintain it for all Senators, in the best interests of this institution and our Federal judiciary.  Article III judges, as I have said, serve with lifetime tenure. They decide issues of civil rights, of personal freedom, commercial disputes of enormous value, and even life and death. These judges can and should, on occasion, also serve as checks on Presidential power overreach. Just in the past few months, article III judges have enjoined executive orders, including the so-called travel ban, the transgender military ban, and the decision to strip funding from sanctuary cities.  We should be advancing nominees who can earn broad support from Members of both parties, nominees with the experience to handle some of the most complex and demanding judicial issues of our time, nominees who have demonstrated the temperament to administer justice fairly. These nominations matter. The nominees who will fill the 140 current judicial vacancies on district and circuit courts across our country will play a critical role in either protecting or undermining the constitutional rights that are the bedrock of our Our courts must continue to be the place where everyone is treated fairly and the legal rights of our citizens can be vindicated.  I wish to close by calling on my colleagues to reconsider how we are conducting the judicial nominee process. This race to confirm as many nominees as possible is not how we respect the rule of law--one of the most treasured American values.  I have come to the floor multiple times since the beginning of this Congress to convey and speak about the importance of bipartisanship, and I will continue to do that today.  As we have seen in important public policy matters, from the healthcare debate to the current debate on tax reform, Republicans and Democrats need to work together to get things done. Purely partisan processes will not succeed in this or future We have to work together to protect our democracy and our rule of law.  I would also like to note that today Sam Clovis withdrew as a nominee for Chief Scientist at the  I am not here to comment on any connection to any ongoing investigations or other social issues but, rather, would like to comment on a simple concern I have had since his nomination; namely, that Mr.Clovis is unqualified to serve as Chief Scientist, lacking any professional training in the hard sciences. This is not just my opinion but a matter of statutory requirement. It is a requirement in statute to have a background in science.[[Page S6994]]Science is critically important to agriculture, and this is another Federal agency that depends on good science.  Given the serious challenges facing America's farmers and our food system--from pollinator declines, to deteriorating soil health, to a changing climate--USDA's science mission is extremely important. As someone whose home State university has a vibrant department of agriculture, as someone who knows the very broad range of Federal funding for USDA that supports agriculture-related scientific research--the USDA is critical in helping provide our farmers with the information they need to improve plant and animal resilience, to be more effective stewards of the land, and to adopt new technologies and practices on their farms. This could all be at risk if the agency's head of science has no relevant scientific training and even rejects current scientific thinking.  I believe that science, not mere opinion or partisan attitude, should underpin our decisions when it comes to our Nation's agricultural policy.  It is my hope that the administration will now go back and recommend a nominee who is scientifically trained and who cares deeply about the role of science in our Nation's agriculture.

507,topic-id,484,"Mr.President, this week we have been talking about some sterling nominees for our Nation's circuit courts of appeals. These are our intermediate appellate courts in the country, one step above the trial courts where cases are tried and one step below the Supreme Court of the United  What most people don't realize is that the Supreme Court only decides roughly 80 cases a year. In other words, there is no guarantee that if your case is tried in the trial court, it will go beyond the circuit court of appeals. So in many instances, our circuit courts are the ``supreme court,'' or the court of last resort. These sterling nominees that the President has nominated include Professor Amy Barrett, who yesterday was confirmed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals by a bipartisan vote of 55 to 43. For some reason, our friends across the aisle have decided it is to their advantage to inexplicably drag out the clock against a really accomplished scholar--and to boot, a mother of seven--but, of course, to no avail.  What is worse is our colleagues across the aisle have seemed to have forgotten some of their own priorities when it comes to judges. For example, the senior Senator from Minnesota has said in the past: ``It is time to get women on the bench.'' Well, we just did that yesterday, and we are going to do it again. ``They should get an up-or-down vote . . . that is what women deserve.'' I would say that is what the President's nominees--whether they be women or men--deserve, but, unfortunately, that hasn't always been the case.  There is still time, however, for our Democratic colleagues to honor their previous statements and to put more women on the circuit courts without needlessly stringing them along with unnecessary delays.  Joan Larsen was the first. She was confirmed earlier today. She fulfills the desire of the senior Senator from Vermont to ``confirm women practicing at the pinnacle of the legal profession.''  That is certainly where Joan Larsen works. She has been a justice on the Michigan Supreme Court and was nominated to the Sixth Circuit, which handles Federal appeals from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Justice Larsen graduated first in her class from Northwestern University's law school. She then clerked for the prestigious DC Circuit Court of Appeals, right here in Washington, She then went on to serve as a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.Supreme  Since then, she has worked in public service at the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice during the George Bush administration and has taught at the University of Michigan Law  Both of our Democratic colleagues from Michigan have returned their blue slips, which is the piece of paper which says they are OK with the nomination going forward, signaling their approval. Given her credentials, my question would be, How could they not?

826,topic-id,1925,"Mr.President, I came to the floor to talk about judges, and I will in just a moment because the majority leader has now filed for cloture--that is a process that will end up in an up-or-down vote--on four distinguished nominees for the circuit court of appeals.  Coming on the tail end of the remarks of the Democratic leader, I must say that sometimes I feel like Washington, DC, is a parallel universe that bears very little relation to the rest of the country or the rest of the world because to hear the Democratic leader talk about some tax plan being written in secret defies the facts. The facts are, this is going to be done in a very public sort of way.  I expect that as soon as Wednesday, the House of Representatives will release their proposal and then, shortly thereafter, the Senate will likewise release its proposal that will then be amended and debated in the Senate Finance Committee just like the House bill will be debated and amended in the House Ways and Means These will be very public, and indeed they should be because they are going to touch on the ways that I believe we can unleash this sleeping giant of an economy, get the economy growing again, get businesses invested here in the United States, and higher wages and jobs for American families, from which all Americans will benefit, regardless of their tax bracket.  I have read that some of our Democratic colleagues--we heard a little bit of this when the President invited the bipartisan Senate Finance Committee members over to the White House just a week or so ago. Some of our Democratic colleagues said: Well, we haven't been included in the process.  Well, they made it clear that they don't want to be included, but I hope they will change their mind, and they will have that opportunity during the course of the Senate Finance Committee debate and amendment process. No one will be prohibited from offering an idea or debating an idea as we work through the process of a tax reform package that will, as I said, hopefully bring down the taxes for hard-working American families, let them keep more of what they earn, and, in the process, improve their standard of living.  As we reform our business Tax Code--which, as President Obama pointed out in 2011, is literally a self-inflicted wound because we have the highest business tax rate in the world, which makes it more likely that businesses will want to invest abroad in jobs and their infrastructure, rather than invest here in America--we want to bring all of that back here so that investors will invest in jobs in America and so that manufacturers can proudly stamp what they make here in America: ``Made in America.'' That is what we are striving for.  Again, I know our Democratic colleague, my friend, the Senator from New York, has a job to do on behalf of the But it is, as I described at the outset, a parallel universe from what is actually happening. It does not bear any relationship to the reality that we have offered our Democratic colleagues to participate with us in growing the economy and giving hard-working American families the opportunity to keep more of what they earn and, thus, improve their standard of living.  Mr.President, at times this Chamber is marked by a spirit of hard work, cordiality, and bipartisanship. Unfortunately, this is not one of those times. Since President Trump's inauguration, our Democratic colleagues have been needlessly obstructing the confirmation of extremely qualified nominees, and lately their focus has been on obstructing nominees for our Nation's Federal courts. But, certainly, their obstruction has been across the spectrum of nominees--slowing down nominees, forcing us to burn time, and then finally confirming nominees which they, by and large, will vote in favor of. This is done for no other purpose than to make it harder for the President, now that he has been elected, to get his team on the field and to serve the interests of the American people and the President's administration.  Lately, as I pointed out, their focus has been on the Federal courts. The majority leader filed four nominations last Thursday, and we hope our Democratic colleagues will think better of dragging out the clock on what is already a certain outcome, which is confirmation of these four nominees. If they do, no one will be surprised.  This year, the Democrats have thrown up every obstacle they can, requiring procedural votes, needless debates, and a lot of time burned here on the Senate clock, with no one on the floor talking about anything one way or the other. It is what we call quorum calls here, when America tunes into what is happening on the Senate floor and there is nothing happening, other than the clerk calling the roll from time to time. That is time we could be using for bipartisan legislation. But the goal here for our friends across the aisle is to cause us to burn the time, keep us from doing the people's work, and obstruct the President's nominees to the Federal bench and beyond.  The irony here is that our Democratic colleagues have even obstructed judges originally nominated by President Obama, so they are not particularly picky in terms of the judges and the nominees they will obstruct. But all they have really accomplished so far is wasting the Senate's time and trying the patience of the American people, who know that there is more productive work to be done than simply having endless quorum calls and silence on the Senate floor while we burn the time on the clock in order to get these nominees confirmed.  Our colleagues know that these tactics will not actually stop a nomination, but they insist on engaging in them anyway, to the detriment of everyone, including the American people. This year, they forced needless cloture votes on seven of eight district and circuit court nominees--more than in any other early Presidency--and they demanded that we use the full 30 hours of floor time per nominee, which Senate rules currently allow for. These are partisan roadblocks that never change the outcome. They are just dilly-dallying. They intend to grind this body's normal procedures to a snail's pace so that nothing much else gets done, and, oh, by the way, then they complain that not enough is being done. That is the tactic. That is the game plan.  By way of comparison, during the first year of President Obama's Presidency, only once did Senate Republicans require a cloture vote on one of the President's nominees. In this Trump administration, Senate Democrats have forced cloture votes on all of the President's nominees except for one. This is all a game to waste time--and maybe a little bit for show.  These tactics don't change the outcome--which is confirmation--ironically, because of the even more cynical ploy adopted by Democrats under President The Senate used to require 60 votes for confirmation of judges. This permitted the minority to block judges who were truly out of the mainstream or who did not enjoy the support of their home State Senator Harry Reid, when he was majority leader--just a few years ago--changed all that. But it seems as though it backfired on him. He tore up the rule book when he invoked the so-called nuclear option in November of 2013 and changed the Senate rules to jam through three nominees to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, eliminating the so-called filibuster because Democrats were upset that the DC Circuit was blocking regulatory overreach by the Obama administration.  Now the filibuster is gone, and I hope that going forward, our Democratic colleagues will recall their previous actions as our caucus proceeds with filling these vacancies. It is good that these outcomes are not in doubt because these positions are too crucial to be left open any longer, even if it means we stay in session over the weekend or at night.  On appellate nominations, we are going to move forward with four--whether the Democrats cooperate or not--because these are nominees who are highly qualified, well-respected jurists and academics. They are the[[Page S6865]]Notre Dame law professor, Amy Barrett, nominated for the Seventh Circuit; Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, nominated for the Sixth Circuit; Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid, nominated to the Tenth Circuit--that is the seat vacated by Judge Neil Gorsuch, elevated now to the Supreme Court of the United States--and the University of Pennsylvania law professor, Stephanos Bibas, nominated for the Third  I look forward to talking in more detail about the high intellectual caliber and remarkable qualifications of these four nominees in the coming days. This is going to occupy the rest of this week. It is worth noting at the outset that the four include three of the most accomplished female lawyers in the United  For now, the important thing to note is our determination to get this done. Under Republican leadership, we are working to deliver for the American people, and confirming judicial nominations is just one example.  Today, the Senate is scheduled to confirm Trevor McFadden to the U.District Court for the District of Mr.McFadden was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee--on which I serve--unanimously in He is Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department of He graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law and has extensive experience in law enforcement. This is someone who was voted unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, yet Senate Democrats are denying him a voice vote or other expedited process--again, forcing us to burn the clock just to get his nomination voted on.  Last week, though, we confirmed Scott Palk of the U.District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, despite the same sorts of games. Mr.Palk was originally nominated to the same seat by President Obama in 2015, so one would have thought that our Democratic colleagues would relent and ditch their procedural gimmicks. But no, they didn't, even for a judge originally nominated by President Fortunately, it didn't matter because Mr.Palk ultimately was confirmed by a substantial margin of 79 to 16. So why the delay? Why the obstruction? Why the foot-dragging if 79 Senators, on a bipartisan basis, are going to confirm the nomination?  I, for one, would like to commend the President on his sterling picks, not only of the recent district and circuit court nominees but also of a judge I mentioned a little bit earlier, now Supreme Court Justice Neil To date, four of President Trump's appellate nominees have already been confirmed: two for the Sixth Circuit, one for the Eleventh, and one for the Eighth, respectively. This is an excellent addition to our Nation's Federal judiciary. All of them, I believe, will faithfully interpret the They know their job is to say what the law is, not what they believe that it ought to be.  The majority leader has been unyielding in his goal of moving forward a productive schedule for the good of the country here in the Senate and moving as swiftly as our rules allow. Stall tactics will not work. They will not prevent us from moving forward with these nominees and confirming them before the week's end. You can count on it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

She is also an exemplary scholar whose research focuses on Federal courts, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation. By all accounts, she is a consummate professional, a beloved teacher, a gifted writer, and a generous person. There is no doubt in my mind she would make an excellent addition to one of our Nation's highest courts.  We know, based on what we have observed in the Senate since President Trump was sworn in on January 20--and some of the comments made by the distinguished former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from Utah, Senator Hatch--we know that our Democratic colleagues are deliberately slow-walking judicial and other nominations, but it makes absolutely no sense to slow-walk the nomination of Professor  They should remember some of their own previous statements. For example, the senior Senator from Vermont said in 2013: ``We need more women in our Federal courts,'' emphasizing that ``women are grossly underrepresented'' there. Well, Professor Barrett would help solve what the Senator from Vermont claimed he saw as a problem.  The junior Senator from Washington that same year said that having more females on the court is ``incredibly important.'' I agree. That is all the more reason for this body to expedite Professor Barrett's confirmation instead of dragging our heels because, as I said yesterday, thanks to the former Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, the Democratic's delay tactics will not change the outcome.  In the Judiciary Committee, some Democrats attempted to argue against Professor Barrett's nomination because of the Law Review article she coauthored almost 20 years ago. I don't have time to discuss the article in depth, but suffice it to say that Professor Barrett has been attacked for, in effect, professing her Catholic faith.  Her article, however, makes clear that any line of criticism that she would somehow subjugate the rule of law and the Constitution to her religious views is baseless. That same Law Review article said: ``Judges cannot--nor should they try to--align our legal system with the Church's moral teaching whenever the two diverge.'' In other words, Professor Barrett is a strong proponent of upholding the rule of law over privately held desires for what it should say, whether they are based on one's religious convictions or some other reason.  Former Chief Justice William Rehnquist once said that no judicial nominee is a tabula rasa--a blank slate.

714,topic-id,346,"Mr.Chairman, I thank my friend and colleague from Minnesota, Congressman Peterson, for yielding this time.  It is clear, I think, for everybody in this Chamber to know how devastating the fires have been, not only in California over the last recent weeks but throughout the West, and it has been this way for several years.  It is long overdue for Congress to address the many issues facing our forests under Federal management, and that is what this legislation attempts to do.  Years of mismanagement have contributed to the rise of catastrophic wildfires, not only in my home State of California but throughout the The heart of the problem is simple: money that Congress has allocated to prevent wildfires has been used instead to put them out.  Now, there are other factors involved as well to be sure, but for years what we have done with densely overgrown forests that need managing is we have set ourselves up to allow these densely overgrown forests to be the subject of very destructive fires if something should go wrong; and, of course, we have lightning strikes and we have other natural conditions that cause these fires.  This year alone, the United States Forest Service has spent about $2.4 billion on putting out fires and has transferred nearly $576 million from management activities. These management activities would go to thinning the forests and to allow for better overall growth. This would be a preventive means to decrease the ability of these fires to grow.  I have concerns with some of the provisions in this legislation and believe it can be improved with some modifications, specifically to the way fire borrowing is addressed and the size of categorical exemptions under public disclosure laws, but this is a work in progress, and we can deal with that.  Let me be clear. We must reform the way our Federal forests are managed, particularly the impacts as a result of the changing climate that we have and as it becomes more pronounced, such as drought conditions.

276,topic-id,1041,"Mr.President, today is an important day on our promise to deliver tax relief for America's working families and our businesses, to create more jobs and grow our economy faster. The House Ways and Means Committee is about to unveil their first draft of a tax cut bill. That is a good step forward after we both passed our budgets a couple of weeks ago.  As we move forward through this process, it is important that we all recognize that tax cuts are a way to let the American people and our businesses keep more of their money, not the government's money but their money. We also have to be mindful of the impact it has on our staggering national debt of over $20 trillion and rising deficits. We can expect the economy to grow at a much healthier rate than it has in recent years if we pass a good tax bill. But we also need to look for other ways to offset the costs of those tax cuts to a degree.  There have been a lot of discussions during the year about what I would consider unwise and painful changes to our tax law. Eliminating deductions, credits, exclusions, exemptions--they are popular and widespread. Some people call that the spinach, in addition to the ice cream of tax cuts.  However, I have what I would call maybe a creative idea, a novel idea--one that I think is gaining momentum in the Senate and in the We can repeal the individual mandate of ObamaCare and save $300 to $400 billion for the Federal Government and therefore deliver more tax relief to our families and our workers and our businesses. That is not my math. That is the math of the Congressional Budget They have said repeatedly that eliminating the individual mandate of ObamaCare would save $300 to $400 billion. That is a lot of tax cuts.  The individual mandate has also been the most unpopular part of More than two-thirds of Americans want to see it repealed. The House has voted repeatedly to repeal it. The Senate has voted to repeal it. Even some Democrats have said that they want to repeal the individual mandate as well. It is the first time in our country's history, after all, that the Federal Government has said: You must buy the product of a private company for the mere privilege of being an American citizen.  We also know that the individual mandate simply has not worked. It was designed to hold down premiums on the ObamaCare exchanges. That has not been the case. Despite the individual mandate being in place now for 4 years, we continue to see premiums spiral out of control. So I think it is a pretty reasonable proposal to repeal the most hated part of ObamaCare to help pay for tax cuts the American people want rather than trying to eliminate popular and widely used deductions, credits, exemptions, and exclusions.  Moreover, it allows us to make more of the tax cut bill permanent because the $300 to $400 billion savings over a 10-year period is just a 10-year period, but it will continue to save money after those 10 years. With the crazy way we do our budgeting around here, that allows us to make more of those tax cuts permanent so that our families and our businesses can have greater predictability to save and invest and grow our economy.  It is also a kind of tax cut for working-class Americans in its own right. According to IRS data, more than five out of six households that paid the mandate fine last year made less than the median income. They were in the bottom half of income earners.  So what are we doing? We are imposing a fine on the working class and working poor because they can't afford the insurance that ObamaCare made unaffordable in the first place. That is crazy.  We can do this in a way that makes it easier to pass a tax bill. I know some of my colleagues around here, especially some of my Republican colleagues, say: Oh, no. We can't go back to healthcare. It is going to make the tax bill a little harder to pass. That is nonsense. It makes the tax bill easier to pass--easier to pass because it helps make the fiscal picture balance, and it helps deliver more tax cuts to our families and our businesses back home.  Some of my Democratic colleagues, drawing on that same estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, will say: You are going to take healthcare away from 15 million people. That is nonsense. This bill doesn't cut a single dime out of ObamaCare, not even one penny, not one penny taken out of Medicaid, not one penny taken out of the subsidies from the exchanges, not a single regulation change. It simply says that the IRS will not fine you if you cannot afford the insurance that ObamaCare made unaffordable.  The $300 to $400 billion--even in Washington, that is a lot of money, and that is money that is better left in the pockets of America's workers and families and on the financial statements of businesses that are looking to expand their operations, increase their wages, and hire more workers.  No, this hasn't been part of the tax debate for a long time. This Chamber considered repealing the mandate as part of our healthcare debate, but the Obama administration called the individual mandate a tax.  In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality saying that it was a tax. The IRS collects it. You pay it on your 1040. That is about the ``taxiest'' provision I can think of.  Let's make a commonsense decision, even if it is a little late in the game. Repeal the individual mandate. Pay for more tax cuts for families and businesses. Make a tax bill easier to pass. Deliver on the promise that we made to the American people to repeal the most unpopular part of ObamaCare and have a very big victory for the American people.  I yield the floor.

1059,topic-id,391,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  It is no secret that a reliable supply of electricity is important to us on many levels, from human health, and, of course, to commercial productivity.  As a former public service commissioner, I can tell you that one of the main reasons for large outages is trees growing in power lines. And one of the reasons for forest fires, oftentimes, is power lines falling in the forest. Fires get to the power lines; power lines create fires. This bill, I think, helps alleviate some of that.  With consumers and regulators demanding, of course, reliable service, and a utility company's natural incentive to keep the sale of electrons flowing, vegetation management has improved tremendously over the years. However, deep within the lands that are managed by our Federal agencies, the potential for problems persists.  My bill creates a pilot program, as the chairman described, for utility companies to partner with the Forest Service to voluntarily perform vegetation management proactively. Under Forest Service approval, utilities can propose a plan to selectively manage vegetation within 75 feet of the right-of-way with the least amount of disturbances as reasonably possible, and outside of designated wilderness areas is a very important point.  All of that work would be paid for by the utility company, not by the Federal Currently, this offer of right-of-way work is the responsibility of the government, and with a strict liability standard, Mr.Speaker, to any utility company to step in and help. There is not an incentive--in fact, there is a disincentive for them to do so. So under the pilot program, these activities will be subject to a more appropriate standard of liability, a gross negligence standard, along with any specific safety requirements imposed under the programs in agreement with the Forest  It removes the barrier for utility companies to carry out this important work not currently being done by them, to reduce direct impacts to damage utility infrastructure, and the amount of fuel for possible forest fires.

554,topic-id,331,"Mr.Speaker, H.1585 does one of the things that most of us came to Congress to do: solve problems and change laws.  The current law excludes most of America from participating in one of the most dynamic parts of our economy, which is private placement investment into small startup companies or, sometimes, very big companies but they are not yet publicly traded. There are opportunities all over to do this, but there are only a small number of Americans who can make the investment.  For many smaller companies, they are faced with a dilemma. One option is no option. They may not have the network of prospective high net worth, accredited investors who can take a look at the kind of capital that would help that company become a thriving larger company, that would help grow the companies that drive the growth in our economy.  As investors, there are people who work in the investment industry who are doing the underwriting--charter financial analysts, for example. Whether they are working for a private equity group, they are doing the work but don't yet have the high net worth. They have true domain expertise.  Imagine the skilled labor who is actually doing the technology implementation, who knows exactly everything that it would take in a program to make a program be the winner in the marketplace but is also well informed on the rest of the risks, has been well educated on the market, and he is prevented from participating.  This act is a step in the right direction. I hope we can accomplish more together.

922,topic-id,296,"Mr.Speaker, access to capital is crucial to promoting a thriving U.economy. It allows companies to invest in growth and to develop new and innovative products and services. Historically, companies seeking a considerable amount of capital have preferred to use an initial public offering and have shares traded on a national securities exchange.  However, the United States has experienced a 37 percent decline in the number of U.listed public companies, which is considerably lower than in the 1980s and 1990s.

712,topic-id,506,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests When we fail to actively manage our forests and Federal lands, we put ourselves and our neighbors at risk. It is time to better manage our fire-prone forests and fix how we pay for wildfire suppression.  California just experienced the deadliest wildfire in our history, and 2017 is on track to be the worst fire season on record. We can't wait until next season. We have got to put the right policies in place now.  The Resilient Federal Forests Act gives us the tools to immediately reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires. It allows us to expedite the removal of dead trees and rapidly mitigate disease-infested areas. It enables us to responsibly manage our forests and improve ecosystems, and it permanently solves the fire borrowing problem. No longer will we deplete forest restoration and management accounts to pay for wildfire suppression. This will give our firefighters the resources they need without hindering prevention efforts.  As California recovers from this year's fires, this bill will help us mitigate future wildfires. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and help improve the health and resiliency of our Federal forests.[[Page H8328]]  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Association of California Water Agencies in support of H.2936.                                                    Association of                                    California Water Agencies,                                                 October 31, 2017.   ACWA Support for H.2936--Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017       The Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA)      respectfully requests your support for H.2936, The      Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. ACWA's 430 public      water agency members supply over 90 percent of the water      delivered in California for residential, agricultural, and      industrial uses.       Recent severe drought and one of the most destructive      wildfire seasons on record have focused renewed attention on      the health of California's headwaters. That attention is well      placed because the forests, meadows and source waters that      play a critical role in our water supply and water management      system are threatened by factors ranging from climate change      to incomplete management to a lack of planning and      coordination.       H.2936 addresses many of these factors. It incentivizes      and rewards collaboration with local governments and      stakeholders by expediting environmental review for      collaborative projects up to 30,000 acres in size. It also      includes important provisions that will increase the yield      and protect the quality of our headwaters.       Additionally, H.2936 solves the perennial ``fire      borrowing'' problem, in which federal land management      agencies must raid non-fire suppression accounts in order to      pay for suppression activities. H.2936 ends this practice      by allowing FEMA to transfer funds to the Forest Service/BLM      when all fire suppression accounts have been exhausted.       As stated in ACWA's headwaters framework, ACWA believes      with more effective management ``healthy headwaters'' could      provide multiple benefits to California's water management      system and the environment. These benefits include: Increased      Water Supply Reliability; Improved Water Quality; Reduced      Impacts from Catastrophic Wildfires; Increased Renewable      Energy Supplies; Improved Response to Climate Change; and      Enhanced       ACWA encourages you to vote for H.2936.

48,topic-id,873,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr.Lipinski, for yielding and for his thoughtful and passionate leadership in combating climate change, and thanks to the strong bipartisan cross section of Members who have come to the floor tonight to talk about the importance of tackling climate change.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues, all of them, to join the bipartisan Climate Solutions I started this caucus with my fellow Floridian, Congressman Carlos Curbelo, to start a new dialogue around climate and Congress because we are already facing difficult challenges. We can't ignore it. We can't bury it in political fights. We need to have an open discussion not only for our future, but for the impact of climate change that we are facing today.  It is no coincidence that this project started with two Members from south A 2015 study projected that some south Florida cities could be underwater within this century. The study's author said some cities appear already to be lost.  Climate change is already here for The effects have hit Florida first.  Scientists have warned of warming average global temperatures and the changing climate for decades. Andrew Clarke of the British Antarctic Survey has spent 40 years at the bottom of the planet watching it disappear. Clarke said: ``You can see the entire environment changing in front of your eyes.''  We now have climate change right before our eyes in south We see the rate of sea level rise outpace the global rate tenfold. We see the high-water mark jump 1 inch every[[Page H8378]]year. Just this week, we see the tides flooding our neighborhoods.  The limestone that serves as the foundation of our State is porous. Saltwater pushes up through the limestone from below the surface.  Lower bridge heights will block boats from reaching open waters. With 165 miles of canals, Fort Lauderdale faces significant threats of rising seas. Who in south Florida hasn't driven around their neighborhood and noticed more puddles, more water accumulating on the sidewalks and streets?  While many Americans might be able to ignore climate change, ignore the science, based on their own personal experience and your own personal experience at home, we can't. Looking out our windows, we see what is already there.  By the year 2100, almost 300 U.cities would lose at least half of their homes, and 36 American cities could be completely destroyed. One in eight Florida homes could be underwater. Those Florida homes represent half of the total expected loss in housing value caused by climate change over the next 84 years. These aren't risks of a distant future. These are the burdens we are placing on our children and on our grandchildren.  In response, and through the work of the South Florida Climate Compact, Miami Beach has initiated a sea level rise plan to lift roads, build up seawalls, and install pumps to clear water in the streets. Fort Lauderdale is fixing roads and drains and sending vacuum trucks into the streets to prevent saltwater damage, upgrading building codes and flood elevation requirements, and requiring higher seawalls.  In Florida, you can't put climate change out of sight or out of mind, but it is not just hitting Florida and it is not just the sea level rise or increasing temperatures.  The National Climate Assessment has documented regional climate impacts hitting every area of the United States:  In the Northeast and Midwest, dramatic increases in heavy precipitation events overwhelm drains and levies, causing flooding and accelerating erosion;  In the Great Plains and Southwest, drought and wildfires strain demands for scarce water resources;  In Alaska, receding sea ice and melting glaciers are damaging infrastructure;  On the coasts, increases in carbon dioxide and warming seas lead to coral bleaching and ocean acidification that is taking its toll on fisheries and the ecosystems.  The diverse and interconnected impacts that we already see throughout our country explain why we already have 60 Members who belong to this new dialogue, the Climate Solutions Caucus, 30 Democrats and 30 Republicans committed to changing the conversation and pushing solutions that will create more resilient communities.  We are committed to understanding the impacts of climate change, the impact on our national security; to investing in clean, innovative energy protection; to protecting our public health; and to overcoming the political obstacles that hold up public policy solutions.  It is time for Congress to come together and admit the challenges that our constituents are already facing at home. It is time to build consensus.  Through the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, we have brought together Members from regions in every part of the country who are experiencing their own climate change challenges. I invite every Member of the House of Representatives to join us. Lift up the voices of your constituents, your farmers, your city officials, your developers, doctors, scientists, and, most importantly, the families whom you represent.  If you are watching at home, call your Member of Congress and urge them to join the Climate Solutions Caucus and help us start the difficult work of building truly bipartisan consensus that will help us tackle climate change together and help us create resilient American communities of the future.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr.Lipinski, again for organizing tonight's discussion.

570,topic-id,533,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Colorado for yielding to me on such an important issue not only to my district, not only to my city, not only to my State, but to our  Mr.Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss a vital program within the Department of Homeland Security, the Securing the Cities program.  The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office's Securing the Cities program enhances the ability of States and localities to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high-consequence events using nuclear and radiological materials in high-risk urban areas through the provisions of training, equipment, and other resources.  Securing the Cities began as a pilot program in 2006 in the New York City region, including surrounding jurisdictions of New Jersey and Since that time, it has expanded to Los Angeles; Chicago; Washington, D.C.; and Once the program is fully implemented, it is estimated that it will protect nearly 100 million people nationwide,  Hailing from New York City and representing Staten Island and Brooklyn, I have seen firsthand the positive impact of the Securing the Cities program. Since 2007, our region has purchased more than 13,000 radiation detectors and trained nearly 20,000 personnel.  I had the opportunity to observe an exercise in Brooklyn last year and witnessed New York City Police Department personnel using Securing the Cities-procured equipment to locate and identify hidden radiological sources in a baseball stadium. During the exercise, I spoke with the participating officers and received a demonstration of the different types of equipment they deployed.  This program is making a difference in New York City, and I support its continued expansion. That is why I introduced H.655, the Securing the Cities Act of 2017. This bill authorizes the Securing the Cities program, underscoring our commitment to protecting our major cities from catastrophic terrorist attacks.  As we, unfortunately, saw earlier this week, our major cities, including my hometown of New York City, in particular, remain targets for terrorist groups. We have to do everything we can to ensure the Department of Homeland Security and our State and local partners have the tools they need to address the threats that we face. The Securing the Cities program is one of those tools.  I am pleased that the House quickly passed my legislation earlier this year on January 31. It is now time for the Senate to act. Mr.Speaker, I urge the Senate to move swiftly to approve H.655 to authorize the Securing the Cities program and ensure its continued expansion.  In April 2010, President Obama stated: ``The single biggest threat to U.security, both short term, medium term, and long term, would be the possibility of a terrorist organization obtaining a nuclear weapon.''  Since that time, the FBI has disrupted attempts by smugglers in Eastern Europe to sell nuclear materials to extremist groups and criminal organizations. The threat has not abated.  I am thankful for the work of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to provide support and guidance to New York City and other urban areas to meet the threats we face.  Mr.Speaker, I urge the Senate to quickly take action to pass the Securing the Cities Act of 2017.

514,topic-id,810,"Mr.President, I am here to speak out in favor of working families and how we can empower American workers to obtain good jobs, to secure a safe retirement after a lifetime of hard work, and to give them the freedom to join together to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.  Unions in the United States are important for our families and for our Nation's economy. Organized labor is one of the greatest forces driving the middle class, which is especially important for our veterans and members of the military. Union jobs help provide our servicemembers and veterans with the economic opportunities that they have earned. Union jobs help working moms and dads put food on the table, and union jobs help power the engine of our economy--our middle class. That is why I am working every day to protect the rights of working people and why I stand shoulder to shoulder with organized labor.  We must work together to combat the assault on the protections that workers have fought so hard to secure. It is more important than ever that we here in Washington work to expand economic opportunity for hard-working Americans, many of whom come from a union home. That means passing labor law reform to make it easier, not harder to join a union. That also means expanding the use of project labor agreements for major construction projects and opposing efforts to repeal prevailing wage laws. It also means defending the Davis-Bacon The Federal Government can and should be a model employer that encourages companies to pay fair wages.  It is important to note the great progress that collective bargaining is making for all people. More families today have two working parents than ever before, and women's growing role in our unions have increased to nearly half of the labor workforce. In Illinois alone, 44 percent of union workers are women. The labor movement, which had a pivotal role in creating national minimum wage, the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, and standards for workplace health and safety, is now also impacting women workers and their families in a significant way.  The collective voice that working Americans have is responsible for improving sick leave and paid family leave policies at the State and local levels. These efforts can also lead to reducing our Nation's long-lasting wage gaps between gender and race. Labor unions tend to raise wages and improve benefits for all represented workers, especially for women, and women of all major racial and ethnic groups experience a wage advantage when they are in a union. There is still a long way to go in the wage gap fight, but unions are leading the way to make those gaps smaller.  Unfortunately, organized labor is under attack. In Illinois, the anti-union surge is on the rise. Nationwide, so-called right-to-work efforts are growing. We need to be clear on one thing: These laws do absolutely nothing to strengthen workers' rights, despite their misleading names and rhetoric.  Make no mistake, opponents of organized labor are well funded and relentless in advancing union-busting campaigns. We must work together and challenge these growing dangers to America's middle class.  The U.Supreme Court will soon decide a case that could determine the future of American unions. A slim majority of conservative Justices may hand down an anti-worker decision that would dramatically undo existing precedent and sabotage the ability of unions to effectively represent hard-working, everyday Workers should not be able to reap all the benefits of union negotiations while refusing to pay dues that made those efforts possible. Make no mistake, a decision sanctioning this practice would strip away freedom from millions of It would steal their freedom to join together to bargain for better wages, it would steal their freedom to join together to insist on worker protections, and, ultimately, it would betray middle-class America, which relies on organizing to effectively negotiate with powerful corporations.  Another way we can support our union workers is by making a serious investment in our Nation's infrastructure, which leads to more good-paying jobs and greater economic opportunity for working families. Improving our Nation's infrastructure is really just common sense. That is why I introduced a bill, which was passed into law, to cut redtape and reduce delays on construction projects in Illinois and our surrounding Upgrading our transportation systems will help Illinoisans and all Americans who depend on our roads and transit systems to get to work every day, as well as businesses that need our airports, highways, and our freight network to ship their products.

The National Forest System is governed by the principle of multiple use--conferring maximum sustainable benefits in the form of wildlife habitat, recreation, clean air and water, and timber harvests.  Sadly, government red tape and the constant threat of litigation has caused paralysis by analysis at the Forest Service leading to a decrease of public recreation activities and a reduction of timber output.  In the counties surrounding the Apalachicola National Forest in Florida's Second District--Franklin, Leon, Liberty, and Wakulla--the lack of timber management not only means fewer jobs, but it also creates a smaller tax base which means fewer resources to provide basic services like law enforcement and good schools.

Earlier this month, Glenn reminded us what service to our country and what the American flag means for us in an op-ed in the Southern Illinoisan, which I have included here.  Poshard wrote:       In 1962, I joined the U.Army on my 17th birthday. I had      just graduated from high school and was following in the      tradition of my family's military service. They had served in      the Civil War and fought their way across Europe and the      Pacific in two World Some were POWs and one, my first      cousin and closest friend, Dennis, awarded the Bronze Star      for bravery in Vietnam, was the first young man from our      county to be killed in that war.       During my three years of enlistment, I served a tour of      duty with the First Cav Division in When my active      duty was finished in December 1965, I immediately entered SIU      Carbondale on the GI Protests against the Vietnam War      were already gripping the campus. They were abhorrent to me,      particularly when the American flag was used to symbolize      anger toward the government. But I was busy, carrying a full      load of classes, working three part-time jobs, and trying to      support a new family. By the time Old Main burned and the      campus closed in the spring of 1970, I was beyond anger for      the thousands of protesters desecrating our flag and      destroying my beloved university.       I made no attempt to understand the difference between the      symbolism of the flag and the substance of the Bill of Rights      as it pertained to freedom to speak against perceived wrongs      of our government.       Years later, as a member of Congress, I was forced to      grapple with this volatile issue again. In my first term, a      bill was submitted to amend the Constitution prohibiting the      desecration of the American flag as a means of protest      against our government. Now, I had to understand this issue      in its deepest, broadest context. My family and I went to      Philadelphia where I sat in Independence Hall, contemplating      those early debates of our forefathers on issues of equality,      justice and freedom. Moved to tears, I was about to cast a      vote of which the historical significance reached back to      arguments which formed the founding documents of our country,      the Declaration of Independence and the       We drove to Gettysburg and I stood where our greatest      President, Abraham Lincoln, delivered his address, taking us      back to our Declaration of Independence, which stated, ``All      men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with      certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life,      liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' When our forefathers      thought they had been denied these rights long enough by the      King of England, they fought a Revolutionary War to gain      them. And they fought a Civil War to extend those rights to      slaves. Over the next 100 years, they fought all over the      world to secure these rights for other people.       President Kennedy spoke of this in his inaugural address.      He said, ``These same revolutionary beliefs for which our      forefathers fought are still at issue around the globe today.      The belief that the rights of man come not from the      generosity of the State, but from the hand of We dare      not forget that we are the heirs of that first Revolution.''      The Declaration goes on to say that when any form of      government becomes destructive of these rights then it is the      right of the people to protest and alter that form of      government so that those rights are secured to the people.      And in the 1960s and '70s, people protested against what they      believed was an unjust war which imperiled their lives, their      freedoms, and their pursuit of happiness. They believed that      nearly 60,000 deaths were enough in a war our government      either could not or would not win.       When hundreds of thousands of mostly white young men in the      '60s and thousands of mostly black young men today protest      against their government, it is because they feel their God-     given rights are threatened. But why involve the flag? In a      Supreme Court decision, Board of Education v. Barnett in      1943, Justice Jackson wrote words especially relevant to this      issue. He said, ``Freedom to differ is not limited to things      that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of      freedom. The test of freedom's substance is the right to      differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing      order''--i.e. our flag.       For many, it is not enough to write a letter to their      congressman, attend a meeting or participate in a march. They      must take the most important thing symbolizing our freedom--     the flag--and cast it at the feet of their government to show      how emphatically they disagree with government allowing the      infringement of their rights. Millions of people of color in      our country today feel threatened. They just want to enjoy      the same security and freedom we all enjoy and the flag has      become central to their protest precisely because it matters,      as it did in the '60s to an earlier generation.       When I protested as a young man in my church that it was      not necessary for God to send His only Son to be sacrificed      for my freedom, that He could have provided another way, the      pastor said, ``Oh yes it was, because He could not win your      freedom from sin by sacrificing that which didn't matter      much, He had to sacrifice the most important thing He loved,      His Son.''       The Supreme Court has said that the use of the flag in      dissent against the government does not diminish it or the      contribution of the men and women who fought for our freedom,      but instead stands as a powerful symbol to illustrate the      substance of our Constitution's Bill of       I listened carefully to the debate in 1990 on the flag      desecration amendment which for the first time in 200 years      would have amended our Bill of These words from      President Reagan's solicitor general, Charles Fried, express      my beliefs entirely. ``The flag, as all in this debate agree,      symbolizes our nation, its history, its values. We love the      flag because it symbolizes the United States; but we must      love the Constitution even more, because the Constitution is      not a symbol. It is the thing itself.''  Reading Glenn's op-ed, I was reminded of the late John Glenn, colleague, friend, and legend. He testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2004 about the flag of the United This is a man who carried the flag into space as an astronaut. He served in the Marine When presented with a flag-burning amendment, he said, ``It would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves.''  Free speech is the bedrock of our democracy. As millions of Americans are participating in the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution today, we should remember Glenn Porshard's point that they do so not to destroy our Republic, but to celebrate the strength of our  Thank you.

997,topic-id,320,"Mr.President, I join my colleague and friend Senator Duckworth to recognize the 100th anniversary of Chicago's Navy Pier, one of the most visited attractions in Illinois and the  Navy Pier, originally named Municipal Pier, was the first of its kind. The pier was created to bring revenue into the city by supporting industry and tourism. The pier opened in 1916 and served as a port for commercial shipping and provided the entertainment and recreation needed to transform Chicago's lakefront into a popular tourist attraction.  During World War I and World War II, the pier was used as a naval training center for over 60,000 Navy recruits and was later named Navy Pier to honor the Navy personnel who served and contributed to the national war effort.  Throughout its history, Navy Pier was home to several Chicago institutions and traditions.  Navy Pier was also the former home to the University of Illinois at Chicago from 1946 to 1965, nicknamed ``Harvard on the Rocks,'' and served more than 100,000 students.  Navy Pier originally held the famous Taste of Chicago in 1978 and today continues to host a variety of festivals, conferences, trade shows, and live entertainment.  Navy Pier opens its doors to locals and visitors to experience Chicago's rich historical and cultural history while enjoying activities and the city's lakefront. Its popular attractions, including the iconic ferris wheel, have attracted more than 9 million visitors a year, generated millions of dollars in revenue, and created thousands of jobs for the region.  It is no surprise that Navy Pier has been labeled a Chicago historic landmark with its significant contributions to the city of Chicago and the  Navy Pier continues to promote tourism and support economic growth in Chicago and the Midwest, while improving its facilities and core missions to better provide services to visitors.

1001,topic-id,4837,"Mr.President, Senator McConnell has come to the floor to complain about what he calls obstruction of President Trump's judicial nominees. The majority leader must feel that many of us suffer from amnesia.  It was just last year Senate Republicans, under the leadership of the same Senator McConnell, set a new standard of obstruction. The most prominent victim of Republican obstruction, Chief Judge Merrick Garland, was President Obama's nominee for the Supreme Never, never in the history of the U.Senate has the Senate denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. Senator McConnell led the Republicans last year in doing that.  Then, Senator McConnell refused to even meet with Judge Garland, refused to give him the courtesy of a meeting, even though the judge's qualifications were unquestioned and even though he had been confirmed to the DC Circuit with broad bipartisan support.  The way Senate Republicans treated Merrick Garland was disgraceful, but Judge Garland was far from the only victim of Republican systematic obstruction during the Obama In 2016, there were 30 noncontroversial judicial nominees--17 women and 13 men--who were denied a floor vote by Senate All but two of these nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee with a unanimous vote of Democrats and Some of these nominees--like Edward Stanton of Tennessee and Julien Neals of New Jersey--sat on the Senate calendar for more than a year, waiting for a vote which the Republican majority leader and his Members refused to give them.  During the last 2 years of President Obama's administration, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 22 judges in 2 years. That is the lowest number of confirmations in a Congress since 1952. By comparison, in the last 2 years of George Bush's Presidency, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed 68 judicial nominees--22 under Republicans and Obama and 68 under Democrats for President  That is not all. Republicans also obstructed 18 Obama nominees by denying them blue slips. That is the permission slip from a Senator from the State of the judicial nominee. That included five nominees who had been State supreme court justices who were not approved by Republican Senators to move to the Federal bench: Lisabeth Tabor Hughes from Kentucky, Myra Selby from Indiana, Don Beatty from South Carolina, Louis Butler from Wisconsin, Patricia Timmons-Goodson from North  Senate Republicans turned obstruction of judicial nominees into an art form under President Yet Senator McConnell, day after day, has said: ``I think President Obama has been treated very fairly by any objective standard.''  He comes to the floor now regularly to complain about ``obstruction'' of Trump nominees. Senator McConnell and the Senate Republicans set the standard for obstruction. If Leader McConnell thinks President Obama was treated fairly with these facts, it is hard to understand why he is complaining about the treatment of President Trump's judicial nominees.  So far this year, the Senate has confirmed four of President Trump's circuit court nominees and four of his district court nominees. At the same point in his first year, President Obama had one circuit court nominee and three district court nominees confirmed. Twice the number have been confirmed under President Trump as were confirmed under President Obama in each of their first years. President Trump's nominees are moving twice as fast as President Obama's.  Senator McConnell controls the floor schedule. If he wants to schedule more votes on judges, I suppose he has the power to do so. He is exercising that power by doing something that has never happened in the history of the Four circuit court judge nominees will be considered this week in the  Since the Republicans in the Senate are dedicating this week to judicial nominations, it gives us a good opportunity to look at the nominees President Trump has put forward for lifetime appointments to the second highest courts in the Federal system.  Time and again, we have seen President Trump nominate people who are far outside of the judicial mainstream. For example, there is John Bush, now a judge on the Sixth Circuit, who blogged about the false claim that President Obama wasn't born in the United States, compared abortion to slavery, and said in his hearing that he thinks impartiality is an aspiration for a judge, not an expectation.  There is Damien Schiff, nominee for the Court of Federal Claims under President Trump, who called Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy ``a judicial prostitute.''  There is Jeff Mateer, a Trump nominee for the district court in Texas, who described transgender children as part of ``Satan's plan'' and who lamented that States were banning so-called ``conversion therapy,'' the pseudoscience of attempting to ``convert'' LGBT Americans into heterosexuals.[[Page S6887]]  There is Thomas Farr, Trump nominee for the district court in North Carolina, whom the Congressional Black Caucus describes as ``the preeminent attorney for North Carolina Republicans seeking to curtail the voting rights of people of color.''  There is Greg Katsas, nominee for the DC Circuit, who refused to say at his hearing whether the torture technique known as waterboarding is illegal.  There is Brett Talley, a nominee by President Trump to be Federal trial judge in Alabama, who has never tried a single case and he wrote in a blog: ``I pledge my support to the National Rifle Association, financially, politically, and intellectually.''  There is Alabama district court and Trump nominee Liles Burke, who hung a portrait of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in his office and defended it at his hearing, saying it had ``historical significance.''  There is Oklahoma district court nominee Charles Goodwin, who received a very rare rating of ``not qualified'' to be a Federal judge from the American Bar  The list of Trump nominees goes on.  Routinely, we see judicial nominees under President Trump who have a history of taking ideologically driven positions that are out of the mainstream. Nearly all of these nominees are members of the rightwing Federalist Society, which President Trump uses as his gatekeeper for the Federal bench.  Do you remember Neil Gorsuch, the Supreme Court Justice? Do you know how he was notified that he had been chosen to be a candidate for the Supreme Court? You would expect a call from the White House, right--maybe even a call from the President? The White House decided to delegate to the Federalist Society to notify him. They called Mr.Leo, their director, and said: Why don't you call Mr.Gorsuch and give him the good news? Well, it is no surprise to those of us who know that the Federalist Society, this conservative group, is now the gatekeeper of all the Federal judges under President  Many of these nominees have given no reassurance that they will be independent as judges. And the question obviously is, What impact will the President--who has unfortunately denigrated and pressured Federal judges in the past--have on them?  Let's consider the nominees before the Senate this week.  Professor Amy Coney Barrett, who has been nominated to sit on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, is a distinguished professor at Notre Dame Law She has strong academic credentials. She clerked for Justice Scalia on the Supreme But she has no judicial experience. And she told the Judiciary Committee that she could only recall three litigation matters that she worked on in her entire career--three. She has never served as a counsel of record in an appellate case or ever argued an appeal.  Given her lack of judicial record and her minimal record as a practicing lawyer, the Judiciary Committee looked at Professor Barrett's academic writings to try to understand who she is and what she believes. Basically, that is all we had to go on.  Much of Professor Barrett's writings deal with when she believes it is acceptable for judges to deviate from precedent. For example, in a 2003 law journal article, she called for ``federal courts to restore flexibility to stare decisis doctrine.'' In a 2013 article, she said that it is ``more legitimate for [a justice] to enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it.'' These are extraordinary--some would say even extreme--views of the obligation of a Federal judge to follow established precedent from someone who is seeking a lifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land.  I would like to address Barrett's Law Review article. She co-wrote an article in 1998 with John Garvey in the Marquette Law Review entitled ``Catholic Judges in Capital Cases.'' This article was about what she perceived then as the recusal obligations of ``orthodox Catholic'' judges. The article said some provocative things. Here are some examples:  ``A judge will often entertain an ideological bias that makes him lean one way or another. In fact, we might safely say that every judge has such an inclination.''  ``Litigants and the general public are entitled to impartial justice, and that may be something that a judge who is heedful of ecclesiastical pronouncements cannot dispense.''  She wrote, when discussing the ``behavior of orthodox Catholics in capital cases,'' that ``the judge's cooperation with evil passes acceptable limits when he conducts a sentencing hearing.''  This is an article written by the nominee. This is an issue raised by the nominee. It was such a profound statement about the relationship between conviction, conscience, and religious belief, that it was the subject of many questions from many Senators on the Judiciary  For the last 2 days, Senator McConnell has come to the floor and talked about the left asking questions about Amy Coney Barrett's religious beliefs. Obviously Senator McConnell has not read the transcript from the Senate Judiciary  Some have suggested it was inappropriate for the Judiciary Committee to even question the nominee about the impact of religious belief on the discharge of her duties. Some of my colleagues have questioned the propriety of such questions in light of the Constitution's clear, unequivocal prohibition on religious tests. But I would remind the Senate that it was the nominee herself, in this 47-page Law Review article, who raised this issue on whether the teachings of the Catholic Church should have any impact on the discharge of judicial duties of a Catholic judge.  So was it any surprise that at least five different Senators--three Republicans and two Democrats--asked her about the article that she coauthored? It is no surprise that the gravity of this publication and the issue it raised led committee members on both sides of the aisle to ask questions about the nominee's religious beliefs, the contents of her writings, and how it would impact the discharge of her duties if she was approved by the  Who asked the first question about the religious beliefs of Amy Coney Barrett? It was the Republican chairman of the Committee, Charles He noted that Professor Barrett had been outspoken about her Catholic faith and asked her when it was proper for a judge to put religious views above applying the law. Chairman Grassley also asked, in his second question, how she would decide when she needs to recuse herself on grounds of conscience.  Senator McConnell comes to the floor and suggests that any reference to that article somehow raises questions of religious bias. Let me say for the record that I do not believe Chairman Grassley is guilty of religious bias, nor have I ever seen any evidence of it. It was hard to imagine how he could avoid the obvious. She had written a lengthy article--coauthored an article on a subject, and he felt duty-bound, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to ask her questions about her beliefs on the subject. I don't believe that Chairman Grassley would ever apply a religious test to any nominee, but he and many of us felt it important to ask Professor Barrett to state her position clearly on the convergence of her faith, her conscience, and her duties as a Federal judge.  Similarly, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch felt it necessary to ask Professor Barrett to make clear a judge's duty when the laws or Constitution conflicts with the judge's personal religious beliefs. Again, I do not believe Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, would apply a religious test to any nominee, but the nominee's writings and the questions those writings raised led him to ask the nominee that question.  Later in the hearing, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, raised the same issue. I will quote what he said to Professor Barrett:       I've read some of what you've written on Catholic judges      and in capital cases, and in particular, as I understand it,      you argued that Catholic judges are morally precluded from      enforcing the death penalty. I was going to ask you to just      please explain your views on that because that obviously is      of relevance to the job for which you have been nominated.  That was from Republican Senator Ted I do not suggest that he was guilty of any religious bias in asking the question about an article written by the nominee.[[Page S6888]]  I take our Constitution seriously when it says there should be no religious test for public office, but many Senators on the Judiciary Committee--three Republicans and two Democrats, including myself--felt the writings of the nominee warranted an inquiry about her views on the impact of her religion on a judge's role. That is far from a religious test in violation of the  At her hearing, I asked Professor Barrett several questions about her 1998 Law Review article. I asked her whether she still agreed with her article. She said in general that she did. I said that even though I am a Catholic, even though I have gone through 19 years of Catholic education, I have never run into the term ``orthodox Catholic,'' which she used in that article. I asked her if she could define it. What was she saying? Whom did she describe? She said it was an imperfect term but explained the context for her use of it. I asked her whether she considered herself in that category, using her term which she put forward as carrying certain obligations on judicial recusal. She acknowledged again that the term is a proxy and that it wasn't a term in current use.  Some have argued that I was imposing a religious test--somehow, the three Republican Senators asking the same question have not been challenged--or that I was insinuating that Catholics can't serve on the bench. That is absurd. I myself am I deeply respect and value the freedom of religion in our country and the And I will let my record speak for itself about the number of Catholic nominees whom I have appointed to the bench or tried to appoint to the bench with the concurrence of the Senate during the course of my career. I voted for many judicial nominees who are of the Catholic religion, including Judge Ralph Erickson, who is outspoken about his Catholic faith and whom I voted to confirm several weeks ago. I am also sure I voted against nominees who were Catholic as well because I didn't think they had the experience, judgment, or temperament to serve in the Federal judiciary.  At nomination hearings, I ask questions to try to understand how the nominee would approach the job of a judge. I asked Professor Barrett questions about issues she raised in her academic writings that could directly impact the discharge of her judicial duties.  I would note that Professor Barrett put forward her views as part of the academic legal debate. Contrast that with Paul Abrams, President Obama's nominee for the Central District of California, who was aggressively questioned by committee Republicans last year about statements he made while speaking at his synagogue. Republicans ultimately blocked Paul Abrams' nomination. No one on this side of the aisle--not this Senator or any Senator--questioned whether they were applying a religious test in rejecting his nomination.  When judicial nominees have put forward their views on issues like the intersection of law and faith as part of the academic legal debate, I think it is fair for members of the Judiciary Committee to ask them about it. That is no religious test by my measure.  I voted against Professor Barrett's nomination in committee because I don't believe she has sufficient experience to be a circuit court judge and because of her writings about precedent. No one doubts that she is smart, but she has barely spent any time in the courtroom. The only basis we have to judge her on is on her academic writings.  Let's be honest. If a Democratic President had put forward a nominee with as little practical legal experience as Professor Barrett and with a similar history of advocating for not following precedent, I think we know exactly how the Senators on the other side of the aisle would have voted. As it stands, I cannot support Professor Barrett's nomination.                       Nomination of Joan Larsen  I oppose the nomination of Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen to the Sixth She is one of the 21 Supreme Court candidates that the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation handpicked for President Clearly, those rightwing organizations are confident that they will like her rulings if she is confirmed.  When she appeared before our committee, I asked some simple questions, and I was troubled by the responses.  In 2006, Justice Larsen wrote an op-ed defending President Bush's use of a signing statement on the McCain torture amendment. The McCain amendment prohibited torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. I asked Justice Larsen about that op-ed and asked her if she believes waterboarding is torture and illegal. She would not answer the question. The law is clear on this matter, and I have voted against nominees in the past who would not acknowledge this.  I also asked Justice Larsen about the $140,000 in ads that a dark money front group called the Judicial Crisis Network had run in support of her nomination. This is the same rightwing, dark money organization that spent millions of dollars in undisclosed donations running ads to oppose Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court and to support the nomination of Neil  I am troubled that special interest groups are making undisclosed donations to these nomination front groups. These special interests likely have a stake in the cases that will come before these judges. The donations should be transparent so that judges can make informed decisions about recusal.  I asked Justice Larsen if she could call on this front group to stop running ads in support of her nomination unless donations to the groups are made public. She responded that this was a political debate on which she could not opine. I think that is an absurd position, given that the debate here is over her own nomination and getting information for her own recusal decisions.  I also asked Justice Larsen if she agreed, as a factual matter, with President Trump's patently absurd claim that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. I think that is an easy question. Justice Larsen ducked it, saying that this was a political debate. I am troubled by these answers. I believe Justice Larsen has not shown the necessary independence from the President or rightwing groups like the Judicial Crisis Network, and she does not earn my vote.                       Nomination of Allison Eid  I oppose the nomination of Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid to the Tenth She is another on the short list of 21 Supreme Court nominees that the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation assembled for President She has now been nominated to the seat of the Tenth Circuit once held by Supreme Court Justice Neil  I am troubled by the dissents Justice Eid wrote in a number of cases. I asked her about one of those cases during her hearing. A 2015 case, Westin Operator, LLC v. Groh, involved a hotel that evicted a group of college-age, intoxicated friends into freezing weather one night. The young adults ended up getting into a car and driving away. The car crashed, and a person was killed. The family of Caitlin Groh, who suffered traumatic brain damage in the accident, sued the hotel for negligently evicting the guests into a foreseeably dangerous environment.  Justice Eid's dissent argued that the court should have dismissed the Groh's family claim on a motion for summary judgment. She said that she saw no material dispute of fact in the case because she claimed the hotel video showed there were taxis in the area that the evicted guests could have taken. But the majority of the court saw the same evidence, the same video, and came to the opposite conclusion.  The majority wrote:       Video footage from hotel security cameras shows two taxis      in the vicinity during the general timeframe of the eviction.      No taxi is visible on screen during the time in which the      group exited the hotel and walked to the parking lot en      masse, but there is a police car parked at the entrance. It      is unclear from the record whether the taxis visible at other      times in the video were occupied or available for service,      whether any member of the group saw the taxis, and whether      the security guards evicting the group were aware if a taxi      was immediately available. . . . One of the people evicted      testified at his own deposition that he tried to look for a      cab outside the hotel but didn't see one.  In other words, looking at the same evidence, the majority of the court could not reach the same conclusion. It is difficult to understand how Justice Eid saw this evidence as undisputed and why she wanted this case dismissed[[Page S6889]]on summary judgment--until you read the part of Justice Eid's dissent where she talks about ``the burden that the majority is placing on Colorado businesses.'' That appears to explain her ruling, not the facts in the case.  In written questions I asked Justice Eid if she had also considered the burden the court's decision would place on these young adults and their families. She did not respond.  This is one of her troubling dissents, but there were others. In the 2014 case of City of Brighton v. Rodriguez, her dissent would have denied workers' compensation for a city employee who fell down the stairs to her office and needed brain surgery. In the 2017 case of People v. Boyd, her dissent criticized the State's decision not to prosecute a person on appeal based on a marijuana possession statute that is no longer operative. The cases go on and give ample reason why I do not believe this troubling record justifies Justice Eid replacing Justice Gorsuch on this important court.                     Nomination of Stephanos Bibas  The last nominee I will address is, I believe, one of the most unusual I have ever seen before the Senate Judiciary Committee--Stephanos Bibas, who has been nominated for a lifetime appointment to the Third Circuit In 2009, Professor Bibas wrote a lengthy draft paper entitled ``Corporal Punishment, Not Imprisonment.'' In it, he said that for a wide range of crimes ``the default punishment should be non-disfiguring corporal punishment, such as electric shocks.'' He went on to call for ``putting offenders in the stocks or pillory where they would sit or stand for hours bent in uncomfortable positions.'' Professor Bibas then went on to say that ``bystanders and victims could jeer and pelt them with rotten eggs and tomatoes (but not rocks).''  For more severe crimes, Professor Bibas called for ``multiple calibrated electroshocks or taser shots'' with medical personnel on hand to ensure ``that the offender's health could bear it.''  He also wrote ``instinctively, many readers feel that corporal punishment must be unconstitutionally and immorally cruel, but neither objection withstands scrutiny.'' He then wrote that corporal punishment ``in moderation, without torture or permanent damage, is not cruel.''  Professor Bibas said at his hearing that he didn't ultimately publish the 60-page, footnoted paper because he realized that his writings were wrong and offensive. He now says that he rejects his paper. But his 2009 paper was not just scribblings on a notepad. This was a polished, heavily footnoted, 60-page draft law review article.  Professor Bibas admitted that he presented this draft paper at conferences--on June 8, 2009, a conference at the University of Pennsylvania Law School; on July 20, 2009, at George Washington University Law School; on September 12, 2009, at that Vanderbilt Criminal Justice  According to the website of the Federalist Society, Professor Bibas also gave presentations on this same article to three student chapters of the Federalist Society--on September 3, 2009, at George Mason; on October 21, 2009, at the University of Florida; on October 22, 2009, at Florida Incredibly, this presentation by Professor Bibas was advertised with the title ``Corporal Punishment, Not Imprisonment: The Shocking Case for Hurting Criminals.'' This is an insensitive title for a presentation that called for administering electric shocks to human beings.  In his draft article, Professor Bibas thanked nine other people for their thoughts and comments on this paper. This was not something the professor wrote as a child or even as a student. When he wrote this paper in 2009, Professor Bibas was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and he had already worked as an assistant U.attorney. He wrote this paper after Congress had considered the McCain torture amendment.  At the hearing I asked Professor Bibas: Do you remember the debate we went through as Americans about the acceptable method of interrogation for suspected terrorists overseas? Do you remember the debate we had on the floor when Senator McCain, the victim of torture himself as a prisoner of war in the Vietnam war, came forward and authored an amendment, which got a vote of 90 to 9, condemning torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of prisoners suspected of being terrorists? I asked him if he remembered that debate, which occurred 3 years before he wrote this outrageous article.  He said at the hearing: Well, I want to make it clear that I don't support waterboarding.  I said: So you support electric shock on American prisoners, but you do not support waterboarding?  He said on the record, under oath: ``I [knew] it was a crazy idea.''  This is a man seeking a lifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land. This paper deeply troubles me. Not only did Professor Bibas go a long way down a dangerous path with his proposals, but this law school professor got the law wrong. The Supreme Court had made clear in 2002 in the case of Hope v. Pelzer that the corporal punishment practiced in the State of Alabama of restraining prisoners by tying them to a hitching post in uncomfortable positions constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth  Professor Bibas wrote his paper, workshopped it, took it to six different universities, and then ran away from it only after he heard how offensive his proposals were.  That is not my only concern about his nomination. We spent a lot of time at the hearing talking about his aggressive prosecution of Linda What was she charged with? The alleged theft of $7 from a cash register. The magistrate judge acquitted this defendant even before the closing argument from defense counsel. The case was weak, yet it was aggressively pursued by then-attorney Professor Bibas apologized at his hearing for this prosecution, but we have seen over and over again that many people try to walk away from who they are and what they have done when it comes to a confirmation hearing.  I believe these cases that I mentioned, particularly this outrageous article, show a real insight into the judgment and temperament of this judicial nominee.  I have been a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for a number of years, and I have seen many nominees. I will tell you without fear of contradiction that I have never seen a nominee who has written an article that is so unsettling and so worrying. I wonder about the temperament of this nominee. Given the power that we are about to give him to judge the fate of others for decades to come, can we really trust his temperament? Can we really trust his judgment?  Sadly, if the shoe were on the other foot, if this were a nominee who had been proffered by a Democratic President before that same committee, I know exactly what his fate would have been. He would never have been taken seriously or considered for such a high position.  Mr.President, the article by Amy Coney Barrett, ``Catholic Judges in Capital Cases,'' published in the Marquette Law Review can be found online at http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1443&context=mulr, and the article by Stephanos Bibas entitled ``Corporal Punishment, Not Imprisonment,'' can be found online at https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/stephanos-bibas-corporal-punishment, so that those who read my statement will understand exactly what it was based on.

1,topic-id,539,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of this measure.  Mr.Speaker, as a New Yorker, my heart aches today. The appalling loss of life on the streets of Manhattan yesterday is a reminder that terrorism remains a threat that demands our focus.  Confronting violent extremism requires sound, reasoned policies; policies proportional to the threat, policies based on good intelligence, careful analysis, and a clear understanding of what we are up against, not policies based on hysterical reactions or biases against certain faiths or nationalities.  I support this bill because it will ensure that the State Department has the tools to prevent American terrorists from traveling abroad or returning to our country.  Under this legislation, the Secretary of State could refuse to issue a passport or revoke a passport for any American who has provided assistance to foreign terrorist organizations. Importantly, it also affords anyone affected the right to an appeals process, helping to ensure due process rights.  This bill is just common sense. It is also a vital aspect of the fight against terrorism. We don't want known threats crossing our borders or slipping from country to country anywhere in the world.  The bill we are considering today would not have, obviously, prevented yesterday's attack, but this is important. This is just a piece of a larger strategy.  The President yesterday called our judicial system, which would prosecute the perpetrator of yesterday's attack, a joke and a laughing stock. I beg to disagree. That is our judicial system, which successfully prosecuted shoe bomber Richard Reid; Ramzi Yousef, the 1993 World Trade Center bomber; Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber; and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law, in March of 2014.  Mr.Speaker, the judicial branch has done quite a good job in prosecuting terrorists. Let's show them a little confidence and give credit where credit is due.  This is deadly serious. The man suspected in yesterday's attack was reportedly radicalized after he arrived in the United We have seen this before in San Bernardino and ISIS inspires its adherents from thousands of miles away. That is a problem. And just as this bill gets at a narrow, specific potential vulnerability, policies to deal with homegrown extremists and terrorists should take a hard look at causes and take appropriate action to prevent this sort of radicalization on American shores.  We won't solve this problem by slamming shut America's front door and clamping down on immigration. In fact, doing so just contributes to the terrorist's ideological ammunition and recruitment efforts. There are proven ways to combat terrorism, but demonizing a religion or chipping away at constitutional rights won't work. Those approaches play right into the tactics terrorists use to radicalize vulnerable Americans, making us less safe and less free.  I want to thank Representatives Poe and Keating, who lead our Committee on Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Mr.Speaker, this bipartisan bill gets to the real concern in the fight against terrorism. I am pleased to support it.  With all due respect to Mr.Poe, that is just the way it is.

100,topic-id,1058,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of this measure.[[Page H8367]]  Let me start by thanking our chairman on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce of California, for his leadership and for working with me to bring this measure forward.  I introduced this resolution with Representatives Chabot, Yoho, Sherman, and Smith, and I want to thank them all for their partnership.  I really listened intently to Mr.Yoho and also know that we make progress on the Foreign Affairs Committee because, as Mr.Poe of Texas said, we work in bipartisan measure, and we try to agree on the language and we try to make sure that the U.Congress speaks with one voice so that both our friends and adversaries around the world will understand that we put partisanship aside. We leave it at the water's edge, and I think that is very important.  I think the kind of people the Foreign Affairs Committee attracts to serve on the committee, on both sides of the aisle, are the kind who keep perpetuating this bipartisan spirit because we have differences in policies, for sure, but we are all We all want to keep each other safe, and we all want to make sure that America does the right thing and that others do the right thing to America as well.  So when we have the incident like we had yesterday with the terrible terrorist attack in Manhattan, it makes us pause, as a Congress, and think about what this all means.  People in Hong Kong were made promises as well. They were made promises years ago that China would be one country, including Hong Kong, but two systems, that Hong Kong would be its independent system. And, of course, the Chinese officials and Beijing regime have tried every which way to go after student protesting, curbing the rights and values of the people of Hong Kong, so this resolution is really very, very important.  I thank, again, Representatives Smith, Sherman, Yoho, and But I also want to recognize Doug Anderson and Sean O'Neill on the chairman's staff for their contributions to this resolution, and Jennifer Hendrixson-White on my staff. It is a great example, again, of bipartisanship when it comes to foreign policy. We work together and we produce what I regard as superior products.  For decades, Mr.Speaker, the United States has shared an important, unique relationship with Hong That relationship has been based on Hong Kong's autonomy from Mainland This resolution underscores our national security interest in seeing Hong Kong remain autonomous at a time when we have seen some troubling trends.  Twenty years ago, at the time of the handover, China made a commitment that Hong Kong would continue to enjoy its special status. Today, China claims that the 1997 Joint Declaration is a so-called ``historical document'' that has, again, ``no practical significance.'' But the UK and the United States believe in international law, and we are committed to holding China to its word, again, a ``one country, two systems'' form of government in Hong  This approach was experimental when the Chinese and British first devised it. You may remember that Hong Kong was a British colony. The Chinese Government essentially said that Hong Kong would continue to have its own executive, legislative, and judicial rights, that the people of Hong Kong would continue to enjoy fundamental rights guaranteed in Hong Kong's laws. But Beijing is now backing away from its commitments, even declaring the Joint Declaration a historical document with no relevance today.  Meddling in Hong Kong's elections by China's National People's Congress led to the Umbrella protests in 2014. Hong Kong residents critical of the People's Republic of China have disappeared, while the presence of the People's Liberation Army has grown.  The credibility of Hong Kong's courts has suffered following decisions to send Umbrella Movement student leaders to prison after they had already served their previous sentences. Academic freedoms have eroded. Self-censorship has grown, and journalists face regular harassment.  So we are worried, Mr.We are worried about Chinese encroachment, about what is going to happen to the people of Hong Kong, and about the way China's newly aggressive posture is going to affect our relationship with Hong Kong in the future.  Twenty years after accepting the so-called ``one country, two systems'' model, China's objective now seems to be making Hong Kong and the mainland ``one country, one system.'' This is not what the government in Beijing, the international community, the United States, Great Britain, or the people of Hong Kong signed up for.  So this issue raises bigger questions, Mr.Speaker:  To what degree will the Chinese Government live up to its international commitments as China continues to expand economically and grow in stature on the global stage?  This measure says, ``Enough.'' It sends a message to China that we in the United States Congress expect Beijing to keep its word. That is not asking too much. It reiterates that our special bond with Hong Kong is based on our shared values, the values of democracy, and that we want to see that relationship endure for years to come.  So I am grateful to my colleagues for working on this measure with me, especially Mr.I ask support from all                              {time}  1900  In closing, Mr.Speaker, let me again remind everyone that Hong Kong is special because of its judicial independence and strong rule of law that is supposed to be protected under the ``one country, two systems'' approach. That is also the reason why the United States shares such a strong strategic relationship with Hong  This resolution is a reminder of why our ties with Hong Kong are so important, and a call for all parties to respect the decades-old commitments that have underpinned Hong Kong's autonomy. At a time when China is growing more and more aggressive in its neighborhood, the United States cannot be seen as ceding ground. We need to stand up for our friends. We need to stand up for our values. We need to stand up for our interests. We need to hold all countries to their commitments, just as the United States lives up to our own.  I ask for all Members to support this measure. I thank our chairman, Ed Royce, and Mr.Yoho for their remarks.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

The figures included in this filing are consistent with the spending limits set forth in the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the levels included in 71, as adjusted to include the budgetary effects of legislation that were enacted after the baseline for the resolution was constructed but before passage of the resolution by the House of Representatives, pursuant to section 4205 of the resolution.  Adjustments for the budgetary effects of the following enacted legislation were included: Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanction Act, H.3364; VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017, 114; Harry Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, H.3218; FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, H.2430; Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, H.76; Emergency Aid to American Survivors of Hurricanes Irma and Jose Overseas Act, H.3732; Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017, H.3819; Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, H.3823; Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017, 1866; Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017, H.601; and Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirement Act of 2017, H.2266.  For purposes of enforcing the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule, which is now found in section 4106 of this resolution, I am resetting the Senate's scorecard to zero for all fiscal years.

131,topic-id,238,"Mr.Speaker, this year my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have wasted months in often misguided debate over repealing the Affordable Care While this debate has raged within one political party, the Children's Health Insurance Program has expired.  I received a letter last night from Governor Tom Wolf of He wants us to act to protect the hundreds of thousands of children in our Commonwealth who depend on CHIP funding to meet their basic healthcare needs.  The GOP has failed to reauthorize CHIP over arguments of how to pay for it and the distractions of a failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care That puts us in a tough spot in Philadelphia and the  I am convinced that something must be done because, as Governor Wolf points out, time is essential for our State and numerous others; yet 300,000 kids are enrolled in CHIP, which will soon run out of money to pay for their care.  The kids who rely on CHIP funding are some of the most vulnerable in our State, and, frankly, they need action now. The solution doesn't have to be partisan. Providing low-income kids and the hospitals that serve them isn't a Democratic or Republican issue; it is a commonsense issue. The failure to act is unacceptable, so I say now we need to do something.  I urge my colleagues in the GOP to get to work on a bipartisan solution.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309-2.txt,1E+14,FISCAL YEAR 2018 ENFORCEMENT FILING,2017,1,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,topic-id,436,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Lipinski, my friend from Illinois, for holding this Special Order this evening, to highlight the important work being done by the Climate Solutions Caucus, to develop economically viable solutions to address climate change.  Mr.Speaker, changing weather patterns and extreme weather events threaten nearly every aspect of New York State's economy, including our agricultural and outdoor recreational sectors. The recreational economy alone generates $42 billion in consumer spending each year, while supporting over 300,000 Empire State jobs. As we work to address climate change in a bipartisan manner, we must employ a variety of techniques that both mitigate impacts and support economic growth.  I am currently working with my Agriculture Committee colleagues on conservation legislation for the next farm bill that will provide important data points on conservation programs and outcomes, allowing legislators and regulators to most efficiently use taxpayer dollars to achieve real conservation results for our farms. These incentive programs support farming practices that, among other benefits, like increasing yield, lowering the amount of fertilizers that are employed, pull carbon from the air and sequester it in the soil.  In addition to sequestering carbon in the soil. We can also work to reduce emissions through greater efficiency in the transportation sector. Indeed, the transportation sector is one area where CO2 emissions have risen in the last 20 years, unlike, for instance, the electric generation sector.  One easy fix would be to modernize the air traffic control system to fly planes on more direct satellite guided routes because direct routes save fuel. When Canada switched to a modern air traffic control system, the national fleet was able to reduce emissions in that nation by millions of tons per year.  These commonsense changes are great steps forward in combating climate change, but our work is far from over. We must address the real impacts of man-made climate change and emphasize the need to develop and create jobs with a goal of protecting our environment. It is critical that we work together to develop smart solutions that will conserve our natural resources and protect our communities and infrastructure for future generations.  Mr.Speaker, I am very pleased to be a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus, and I look forward to working with my colleagues. I, particularly, want to applaud our distinguished friend from Illinois, Mr.Lipinski, for organizing this Special Order tonight on a bipartisan basis so that we can address this issue and allow the folks at home and all around the United States to better understand the work that is being done here in Congress on a bipartisan basis to address climate change.

981,topic-id,2960,"Mr.President, last Thursday, Leader McConnell filed cloture on four circuit court nominees, including two nominees who had been voted out of the Judiciary Committee that very morning.  Voting on four controversial circuit court nominees in 1 week is highly unusual, as is voting on nominees just days after they have moved out of committee.  Senators who aren't on the Judiciary Committee deserve time to consider nominees, review their backgrounds, and make an informed decision for their vote.  But that is not what is happening in the Senate this week. Instead, Republican Senate leadership is pushing President Trump's judges through as quickly as possible.  Jamming through as many controversial judges as possible in as short a time as possible--to lifetime appointments, no less--is irresponsible. I cannot remember a time when we had cloture votes on four circuit nominees in 1 week.  It is important to understand the context in which we find ourselves.  After failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and with the Republican tax reform plan facing opposition within his own party, President Trump has turned more and more to Executive orders to influence policy.  As we have seen, move after move has run into opposition in Federal courts. So it is really no surprise that Republicans are trying to stack those courts with ideological judges whom they hope and expect will uphold the President's harmful policies.  Consider how many Trump actions have or will see time in the courtroom, and you begin to understand why Republicans are rushing to fill these vacancies--after allowing countless vacancies to remain unfilled at the end of the last administration.  In each of the following cases, the President and Senate Republicans seem to hope that the outcome will be different with a transformed judiciary.  The President's Muslim travel ban has been struck down by multiple courts who ruled that the ban is based on religion and suspending the refugee program is discriminatory, with no basis in fact. The President went so far as to personally insult some of the judges who heard arguments on the travel ban.  The President's decision to end the DACA program is also likely to find its way into the courtroom. Beginning on March 5, 2018, it is estimated that around 1,000 DACA recipients per day will lose their protection from deportation. By ending the program and thrusting 690,000 young people into legal limbo, the President ensured that lawsuits would be filed, and he certainly is hopeful that conservative judges are on the stand to hear the cases.  We have also seen the Trump administration make moves to restrict women's access to healthcare. One woman had to go to Federal court twice to challenge the government's efforts to restrict her access to reproductive care. The full D.Circuit chided the attempt to ``bulldoze over constitutional lines'' and deny this 17-year-old young woman court-approved reproductive care. Republicans tried to block three of President Obama's nominees to this same court and now are rushing to fill its one vacancy as quickly as is possible. That is not a coincidence.  President Trump's voter fraud commission will also certainly end up in legal battles. At least eight lawsuits have been filed against the President's Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, created to investigate false claims that 3 million people voted illegally last year. It is possible the commission has already violated Federal laws with regard to how it handled sensitive information. This is already the subject of ongoing litigation.  These are just a handful of Trump actions that will see time in court. They highlight not only what is at state, but also why the President is so anxious to hurry judges that he has selected on the bench.  I would add that Republicans are now rushing to fill judicial vacancies for this President after spending years blocking President Obama from filling many of these same vacancies. It actually is the most egregious effort I have ever seen.  This record of obstruction dates back to 2001 during the Clinton administration. Senate Republicans used secret holds on nominees to prevent judicial nominees from receiving committee hearings or floor votes. This resulted in Republicans ``pocket filibustering'' nearly 70 of President Clinton's circuit and district court nominees, preventing their confirmation. As discussed by Senator Leahy when he served as chair and ranking member of the committee, Republicans would block nominees through pocket filibustering, which meant they would deny nominees hearings or up-or-down votes in committee. This is a chart that lists those nominees.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have the chart printed in the Record following my remarks.  In the first 5 years of the Obama administration, Republicans forced Obama's district court nominees to wait nearly three times as long and circuit court nominees nearly twice as long as Bush nominees for confirmation votes. During the final 2 years of his Presidency, Senate Republicans engaged in a historic blockade of judicial nominees.  It wasn't just the unprecedented decision to block Chief Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme  During the final 2 years of President Obama's administration, only 22 judicial nominees were confirmed--and just nine in the final year.  That is the lowest number of judges confirmed in a 2-year Congress since President Truman was in office. Contrast this with the last 2 years of the Bush administration when Democrats were in the Senate majority and still confirmed 68 of his nominees.  In the last 2 years under President Obama, there were 53 article III judicial nominees pending in the Senate at the end of 2016. That is 53 nominees who Republicans either refused to hold hearings on or refused to confirm once they were on the floor.  In fact, of those 53 nominees, 25 had been voted out of committee and were waiting for confirmation on the Senate floor. All they needed was for the Republican leadership to bring them up for a floor vote.  Twenty-three of those 25 nominees had been unanimously voice-voted out of committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. Still, Republicans refused to confirm them.  Since my colleagues have spent some time noting that three of the circuit court nominees we are considering this week are women, I would like to note that half of the nominees Republicans blocked from becoming circuit and district court judges last year were women.  Here is the point: Republican leadership wanted those seats, including the Supreme Court, left open in the hopes that a Republican would be elected President and pick new judges. They ignored the needs of country and the judiciary for their own political wants.  Two of the nominees we are considering this week--Amy Coney Barrett and Stephanos Bibas--are filling seats that President Obama had nominated African-American women to. Neither were confirmed because Republican home-State senators didn't return blue slips. That is a fact.  Judge John Bush, who now sits on the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, was likewise confirmed only because Leader McConnell refused to return a blue slip on a well-qualified woman, Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Lisabeth Tabor Hughes, whom President Obama had nominated last year.  Republicans exploited the blue slip process during the Obama Presidency, but today we hear constant rumors that Republicans want to do away with the process--another tool allowing them to ram through more judges.  It is worth noting that, even though Democrats had sincere, legitimate concerns about the writings of John Bush--which included him equating slavery and abortion--his nomination was rushed through by Leader  John Bush was confirmed just 73 days after he was nominated. In fact, President Trump's first four circuit court[[Page S6986]]nominees waited just 84 days, on average, from nomination until confirmation. By contrast President Obama's first four circuit court nominees waited an average of 213 days. That is nearly three times longer.  The hypocrisy we are seeing on display is stunning. With that in mind, I want to say a few words about the nominees themselves.  Our Nation's appellate courts are the final deciders of the vast majority of cases, so a nominees experience matters a great deal to me. However, the first nominee we voted on, Professor Amy Barrett, who has now been confirmed to the Seventh Circuit, had very limited experience.  She did not have any experience as a judge, and she only worked on one trial before becoming a professor.  Practically speaking, this meant the only record on which we could judge her was her academic writings. In those writings, I was especially troubled by her position that Supreme Court precedents can simply be set aside when a Justice disagrees with them.  The National Women's Law Center wrote that these writings ``raise serious concerns'' about how Professor Barrett, if confirmed, ``would interpret, apply, and follow precedent, including Supreme Court precedent.'' In fact, they point out that Professor Barrett's ``prior writings consistently suggest that she believes precedents like Roe and Casey should be considered weaker and are susceptible to challenge. . . .''  That is why I was unable to support Professor Barrett's nomination.  The second nominee we voted on was Justice Joan Larsen for the Sixth Justice Larsen, who currently serves on the Michigan Supreme Court, has deeply troubling views on Presidential powers.  In fact, she advocated for the Bush administration's view that the President had the authority to disregard a law that Congress had just passed, which prohibited the U.Government from using torture.  It is no surprise that President Trump, who has shown contempt for the other coequal branches of government, nominated Justice Her views are undoubtedly part of why the President included Justice Larsen on his short list of Supreme Court nominees last year.  President Trump repeatedly made clear that he was only considering nominees for the Supreme Court who passed his litmus tests, including to overturn Roe v. Recall President Trump's interview with ``60 Minutes'' immediately after he won the election. He said, ``I'm pro-life. And the judges are going to be pro-life.''  He added that his judges were going to be ``very pro-Second Amendment.''  We heard from 30 groups who were concerned about Justice Larsen's nomination, and several highlighted the danger of this litmus test.  As Lambda Legal wrote, ``A decision by this Committee to advance her nomination will be rightfully understood as not only a threat to Roe but also to the LGBT cases that were built upon Roe's foundation.''  I opposed Justice Larsen's nomination.  The third nominee we are considering is Justice Allison Eid for the Tenth She was also included on President Trump's short list of Supreme Court nominees last year.  Since 2006, Justice Eid has served on the Colorado Supreme A review of her opinions shows why the Denver Post wrote in September before her hearing: ``On the state's high court, Eid has earned a reputation as one of its most conservative members.'' Here are just a couple of examples.  In 2014, the Colorado Supreme Court held that a worker who fell down a flight of stairs at her workplace and suffered multiple aneurysms as a result deserved to be compensated under the State's workplace compensation law. Justice Eid dissented, arguing that the employee did not deserve any compensation for her injuries, in City of Brighton v.  In 2012, Justice Eid was the lone dissenting vote when the Colorado Supreme Court upheld a new redistricting map that was drawn to protect residents' constitutional right under the ``one person, one vote'' standard. The old map had unequal populations and was redone with the extensive work of a trial court.  On appeal, Justice Eid was the only dissenting judge, and she argued to throw out the trial court's work because she believed it had not given ``adequate weight'' to one entirely optional factor.  Justice Eid's record has also led a number of organizations to oppose her nomination, including the AFL-CIO, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights--LCCR--and Planned  I opposed Justice Eid's nomination.  The final nominee we will vote on is Professor Stephanos Bibas for the Third Like Professor Barrett, much of his legal career has been spent in academia, so our job in reviewing his record is to carefully consider his writings.  Professor Bibas's writings have focused on criminal law, and he has pushed forward controversial ideas about punishment. His most troubling proposals were set out in a paper he wrote in 2009.  In it, he argued that, for a wide variety of crimes, ``the default punishment should be non-disfiguring corporal punishment, such as electric shocks.''  Bibas also suggested ``putting offenders in the stocks or pillory, where they would sit or stand for hours bent in uncomfortable positions. Bystanders and victims could jeer and pelt them with rotten eggs and tomatoes (but not rocks).''  For more severe crimes, he advocated ``multiple calibrated electroshocks or taser shots,'' with medical personnel on hand to ensure ``that the offender's health could bear it.''  These views are shocking and outside of the mainstream. A few years before Professor Bibas wrote his article, this body had already debated and passed the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, which prohibited ``cruel'' and ``degrading'' punishment of prisoners.  I appreciate that Professor Bibas testified to the Judiciary Committee that he now understands that his views on use of corporal punishment for prisoners are, in his words, ``wrong and deeply offensive.''  He came to this conclusion only after he repeatedly made public presentations on his paper, including one to a Federalist Society Chapter entitled, ``Corporal Punishment, Not Imprisonment: The Shocking Case for Hurting Criminals.''  I cannot support Professor Bibas's nomination and will vote no.  In closing, as my colleagues consider how they will vote on these and other nominees, I would urge them to consider the broader context in which we are considering this President's judicial nominees.  We have a President who has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law and for the independence of the federal judiciary. I am deeply concerned that this President expects the courts to just rubberstamp his policy preferences.  For every judicial nomination, we have to consider carefully the nominee's record and reflect on whether they can truly be fair, independent, and impartial--whether they will respect the rule of law. For these reasons and the records of the four nominees I have just discussed, I cannot support them.

81,topic-id,804,"Mr.President, although nearly half of those graduating from law school are women, only about a third of the Federal judges are female. This week, we had the honor of adding three more.  I rise to congratulate these three successful women because their additions to the Federal court system are historic. They serve as more evidence that well-qualified women are becoming more confident in stepping forward and serving our great  Amy Coney Barrett, Joan Louise Larsen, and Allison Eid are three more cracks in that glass ceiling. Their confirmations are proof that successful women can balance responsibility and seize opportunity when it knocks on their doors. These accomplished nominees are not joining the Federal bench because of a frivolous attempt at trying to balance out the gender disparity in our courts. They will be donning the black robes because they will have earned it.  Amy Coney Barrett, our new judge for the Seventh Circuit, climbed to the ranks by clerking for Judge Laurence Silberman on the DC Circuit and Justice Scalia on the U.Supreme In working with her husband, who is a successful lawyer in his own right, she has balanced family responsibilities while having achieved personal success. At the age of 30, she was hired as a professor at one of the Nation's best law programs, Notre Over the past 6 years, she has sat on the Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure on the recommendation of Chief Justice  Joan Louise Larsen, the next U.circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit, is proof that hard work pays off. After graduating at the top of her class from Northwestern, Judge Larsen clerked for Justice Scalia on the U.Supreme Court before serving as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the U.Department of Justice, Office of Legal She most recently sat on the highest court in her State, the Supreme Court of She has done this while raising two children with her law professor husband.  Allison Eid, the newest judge for the Tenth Circuit, has demonstrated brilliance throughout her career. After graduating from Stanford, she worked as an assistant speechwriter for William Bennett, President Reagan's Secretary of After graduating from law school with honors, she clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas of the U.Supreme She has served with distinction on the Colorado Supreme Court since 2006. With her husband, Troy, the first Egyptian American to serve as a U.district attorney, she has helped to raise two children.  These three successful women should serve as role models to girls and boys across this They are proof that women do not need to stand back while others find success, and their confirmations are evidence that, when women support each other, they will achieve at the highest level. They also demonstrate the power of families when they work together to accomplish goals.  We should be proud to have confirmed these three great women to the Federal bench. All of us receive letters from children who ask questions about: What do you do in the U.Senate? Weeks like this one should be part of our response. We empower those who have empowered themselves regardless of their gender. We shape our legal system by filling it with qualified women who are dedicated to preserving and protecting our Constitution--the framework of our free We proclaim that hard work is to be rewarded. These three important confirmations are further proof that young women do not have to choose between raising families and rising to the top of their chosen professions.  I stand here today and send a message to every little girl who wonders about politics and every young woman who faces the challenges of starting out in her career: You can do this too. We love you, and we support you. Be confident when you want to step forward and serve your community and serve your country.  The judicial nominees who were voted on this week exemplify the best of our Nation's legal community. Their confirmations to the Federal bench have added significant talent to our Nation's system of justice. The work being done by the President and by this Senate in shaping the Federal courts with those who will follow the rule of law is historic. President Trump should be applauded for nominating such well-qualified people to be on the Federal bench.  All of the nominees voted on this week will make exceptional additions to the Federal bench, and I hope that the President will send many more like them for us to consider. All four are deserving of their new positions, and I am sure that they will honor and protect the Constitution and serve the American people well as good judges.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, serving as good stewards of our environment is something that each and every one of us are called to do no matter who we are or where we come from.  It is critical in order to preserve public health. The reality is climate change is real and humans are a contributing factor. Congress must take serious and reasonable steps to combat it.  As an Eagle Scout and a conservationist who grew up in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, I have always been captivated by the natural beauty of our open spaces and wild places. We have it all in Bucks County: preserved farmland, amazing parks, expansive forests, and historic rivers. I believe that with these natural treasures comes a special responsibility to care for and protect our natural resources at the local, State, and Federal level.

482,topic-id,256,"Mr.Speaker, several economic indicators show us that our economy is growing: the unemployment rate is down, the stock market is up, consumer confidence is at its highest level in over a decade, and businesses are starting to invest in their future again. However, we cannot rest on this short-term snapshot.  For too long, top-down policies from Washington have built a system that is based on protecting the status quo rather than helping small businesses and middle class families. We need to embrace a governing vision that advances the American Dream and puts jobs and economic growth above the partisanship that too often divides us, and this starts with tax reform.  If this Congress is serious about standing up for middle class families and unleashing the power of the American economy, tax reform is the natural starting point. The model is straightforward. We need to simplify the ridiculously complex Internal Revenue Code, eliminate the loopholes that allow corporations and individuals to avoid paying their fair share, lower the rates for middle class families and for small businesses, and to broaden the tax base. We have the chance to make real, lasting changes to our broken and bloated tax system, and we need to act now.  As a CPA and a member of the Small Business Committee and as a concerned taxpayer, I am committed to fighting for real tax reform based on three core principles: encouraging growth, simplifying the Tax Code itself, and increasing service for the taxpayers. The time is now to act.

855,topic-id,479,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, Andy Biggs, for him joining all of us in this fight to stand up for terminally ill patients across this country.  Mr.Speaker, each year, more Americans receive the devastating news of a terminal diagnosis. Even with the amazing work done in American medical research and development, for too many families, access to these potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at all.  Thousands of terminally ill patients, like my constituent, Matt Bellina, suffer needlessly while awaiting final approval for drug therapies and other medical technologies.  In April 2014, at age 30, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, otherwise known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing those with ALS to lose control of their muscles.  Although this disease stopped Matt's career as a U.Navy aviator in its tracks, he persisted and actively involved himself in the ALS community as a strong advocate for Right to Try legislation.  While the Food and Drug Administration carries out its three-phase approval process, which can take years and cost billions of dollars, many patients simply want the chance to try treatments that have already been demonstrated to be safe.  A bill that was unanimously passed by the Senate will offer them a chance to extend their lives. The Right to Try Act, 204, would ensure that terminally ill patients, together with their physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers, can administer investigational treatments where no alternative exists. In fact, this bipartisan idea is already the law in 37  A Federal Right to Try law would prevent the government from blocking access to potentially lifesaving medications. It would require patients to first try all other available treatments and be unable to participate in clinical trials.  I want to note that these provisions only apply to terminally ill patients. It does not undo the FDA approval process but provides a potential lifeline for those who cannot wait. Moreover, it requires a physician to certify that other options are either exhausted or unavailable.  This bill requires that a product meet a demonstrated level of safety by attaining FDA phase I approval. We have worked with the drug companies to ensure adverse outcomes are not used against the ongoing application for approval. Additionally, patients, doctors, and manufacturers do not assume any additional liability under this act.  For those patients caught in between the traditional drug approval delays, a clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and limited time, the Right to Try simply establishes the freedom for patients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far outweigh the risks. It gives them the option of trying to save their life.  Mr.Speaker, whether it is a father like Matt courageously battling ALS, or a brave child living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, they deserve the right to try.                              {time}  2100  ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381.txt,1797,RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT OF 2017,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

278,topic-id,481,"Mr.President, we currently have the highest Federal corporate tax rate in the developed world. Businesses are moving from here overseas to seek a friendlier tax environment.  If we are going to compete globally--and we are in a global economy--we have to have a conducive tax and regulatory environment to do so. We don't have a conducive tax environment now. We cannot compete globally with the second highest or the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world.  We also have a tax code that is far too complicated. Taxpayers and companies alike spend about 9 billion hours a year--9 billion hours a year--combined with IRS requirements, and this costs the U.economy more than $400 billion a year. This is just compliance costs.  The Tax Code is also full of costly loopholes which allow businesses and millions of individuals to get away with paying no income tax or no corporate tax.  After over 30 years, I am pleased to see Congress finally getting down to the work of doing a tax overhaul. A few weeks ago, we passed a budget that allows some cuts--about $1.5 trillion. I believe that when we do cut certain taxes, it does generate a greater economic activity, which does in turn mean additional revenue to government. However, there are limits to that model. We cannot simply assume we can cut all taxes and realize additional revenue. It is important that tax reform comes as well.  We have been hearing a lot about cuts, cuts, cuts. If we are going to do cuts, cuts, cuts, we have to do a wholesale reform. With the national debt exceeding $20 trillion, we have to take this seriously. Rate reductions have to be accompanied by repeal or reform. We cannot simply rely on rosy economic assumptions, rosy growth rates to fill in the gap. We have to make tough decisions. We cannot have cuts today that assume we will grow a backbone in the out-years in terms of the real reforms we are going to need. We have seen this before. We make the cuts now; we rely on rosy economic assumptions; and then, in the out-years, if those don't come about, we forget what we were supposed to do in terms of reform.

894,topic-id,845,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss a matter of religious liberty. In particular, I urge this body to respect our constitutional values and avoid any hint of applying religious tests to those who heed the call of government service.  Freedom of religion is as foundational a principle as we have in this country. Yet some in this Chamber want to take a cabined view of it. If you are a judicial nominee, it is fine to attend the occasional worship service, but don't let on that you take it too seriously. That seems to be unacceptable.  From the inception of our Republic, religious believers have chosen to serve the country in countless ways. Whether through the Armed Forces, holding elected office, or sitting on the courts, Americans of faith always answered the call. We should welcome this service, and we should not sit idly by while others question the propriety of their service by suggesting a de facto religious test.  The Framers of the Constitution were fearful of this very thinking. They understood the importance of religious participation and foresaw the benefits religious believers of all backgrounds would contribute to the common good. They also knew, from centuries of war and suffering in Europe, the high cost of religious intolerance.  That is why they made it clear in article VI of the Constitution that no public officers could be subject to a religious test. This edict was entirely unambiguous in its language and its intent. This country is to be served by[[Page S6905]]people of all faiths, committed to the Constitution and the common good. It is up to us to question the qualifications and jurisprudence of nominees, not their religious views.  Unfortunately, that is not what is happening to Professor I was at the confirmation hearing, where she faced inappropriate questions and objections based on her religious views. I witnessed a citizen heeding the call to serve her country, only to face inquiries into her religious beliefs that bordered on ridicule. My friends on the other side of the aisle defended their questions and their conduct, and I don't doubt their sincerity, but there is little comfort in the defense that it doesn't matter that Professor Barrett is a Catholic, but somehow it matters what sort of Catholic she is. These are unconstitutional distinctions without differences.  In addition, otherwise respectable news outlets have provided sensational reports of Professor Barrett's personal charismatic religious practices. As a Member of the Senate, I find this troubling, as a person of faith, I find this objectionable, and above all, as an American, I find this abhorrent.  It is religious liberty--enshrined in constitutional provisions like article VI and the First Amendment--that has allowed my faith and so many others to flourish in the United It is also religious liberty that is threatened when we seek to evaluate the fitness of nominees for high office based on religious orthodoxy.  I have endeavored to be consistent on this issue during my time in public service. When the Presidential nominee of my party--the party of Lincoln--called for a Muslim ban, it was wrong, and I said so. That is not what we stand for. When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim shouldn't be a Member of Congress because of his religious faith, it was wrong; that this same judge is now my party's nominee for the Senate from Alabama should concern us all. Religious tests have no place in  Standing up for people of faith--whether Muslim or Catholic--who are facing unfair prejudice should be an act of basic conscience. It should be expected of all of us, regardless of party. It is no better for Democrats to evaluate the judicial nominee based on how many books are in the Bible on which she swears her oath, than it is for Republicans to judge a Congressman who swears his oath on the  To suggest that somehow a Roman Catholic judge would discard the Constitution in favor of Church doctrine--which she has emphatically and repeatedly said she would not--is as wrong as suggesting that a Muslim judge would be somehow forced to follow sharia law over the  Religious liberty must not depend on the religion in question. So I ask, in light of these circumstances, who will stand today against all cases of religious bigotry? Are there true liberals who will stand up for the liberal values of religious tolerance? Some have, like Professors Larry Tribe, Noah Feldman, and Chris They have said: Who here will join them?  This very body is made up of individuals from around 15 different faiths. Each of us has sworn an oath to uphold the Each of us here feels we can competently carry out our duties, as do those in the judicial branch who swear a similar oath to uphold the  Let us stand together today without equivocation and say no to religious intolerance in all its forms by examining the jurisprudential views and professional qualifications of judicial nominees, not their relationship with the  I yield back.

548,topic-id,432,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1585. This bill will expand the definition of accredited investor, a status reserved for investors who possess the sophistication and financial means necessary to invest in private securities offerings.  Currently, accredited investors are limited to persons who have an annual income more than $200,000, or $300,000 together with a spouse, or a net worth in excess of $1 million, excluding a primary residence.  Aside from the primary residence exclusion added by the Dodd-Frank Act, the accredited investor definition has not been updated since 1982.  In light of the growth of private markets and increasing complexity, the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee recommended that the SEC conduct additional study of adjusting the current thresholds for inflation and establishing alternatives based on existing credentials, investment experience, and limits of investments.  An updated definition is long overdue. Current law speaks almost exclusively to the ability to bear a loss rather than the sophistication of the investor.  The bill we consider today is the product of bipartisan compromise. Last Congress, it was significantly narrowed to include only persons who qualify based on current income and net worth tests: registered brokers, and investment advisers, and those who have the appropriate educational background and job experience as determined by the SEC and verified by  These categories are in line with the recommendations of the Investor Advisory Committee and effective proxies for sophistication, access to information, and ability to withstand losses.  There is an inherent tension between democratizing markets and protecting investors on the basis of their ability to bear financial losses.  This bill includes Ranking Member Waters' bipartisan amendment to require the SEC to adjust net worth and income thresholds for inflation every 5 years. This will establish the economic value of the thresholds in current law, as the dollar amounts are increased, with growth in the overall economy and changes in the value of the dollar.  Doing so will preserve access to private markets for those currently investing in them. Private offerings can offer some of the best returns in the market, but they obviously carry different risks, like illiquidity, than securities in the public markets.  While there can be investment opportunities that significantly increase a person's net worth, they cannot be immediately sold if an investor's financial circumstances change.  So this bill strikes a good compromise between giving access to investments without exposing the retirement accounts of working families to excessive risks.[[Page H8322]]  Mr.Speaker, I urge broad support for the bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Emerging growth companies are those with less than $1 billion in revenue, $700 million in public float, and $1 billion in nonconvertible debt. The JOBS Act enabled these companies to speak to institutional investors prior to an IPO without it being considered an unregistered offering for sale of securities.  The definition of a securities offering is appropriately broad to protect investors and ensure transparency in our markets by requiring registration and significant disclosures. However, companies considering a public offering should be able to talk to the most sophisticated investors in the markets, large institutional investors, to gauge the interest in the offering. Having that ability will help encourage public offerings because it enables companies to realize efficiencies in assessing demand.

1022,topic-id,652,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate the career of Minnesota Adjutant General Richard Major General Nash retired on October 31st, after leading the Minnesota National Guard for the past 7 years. His leadership has ensured the excellence of the Minnesota National  Major General Nash enlisted in the infantry in 1972 and quickly rose through the ranks, earning a commission as a second lieutenant following completion of officer candidate school. Since then, he has commanded at all levels, starting as a company level commander and rising to lead the U.Divisions-South supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2010.  In November of 2010, Major General Nash was appointed by Governor Tim Pawlenty to be the adjutant general of the Minnesota National In this role, he has skillfully commanded Minnesota's Army and Air National Guard units not only in missions in Minnesota, but also as they have served across the globe, in places such as Iraq, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Under Major General Nash's stewardship, the Minnesota National Guard has performed every mission reliably and with distinction.  I have had the honor of working closely with Major General Nash during my time in office. He has been a tireless advocate for the Guard on issues ranging from installations, to the Guard's renewable energy use, to the important task of ensuring the Guard's annual priorities are met. One area I worked particularly closely with Major General Nash on has been our efforts to expand medical, education, and retirement benefits that had been previously denied to National Guard soldiers deployed under the 12304b authority. Major General Nash has been a strong voice on this issue, and his work was critical to my efforts to enact bipartisan legislation to ensure Minnesota Guardsmen and Reservists have access to these services. Our veterans have earned these benefits through their service and sacrifice to our country, and they should not be denied those benefits.  In addition to his exemplary leadership of the Minnesota Guard's service in missions foreign and domestic, Major General Nash deserves special recognition for his work preparing the force for future energy and sustainability challenges. In particular, his work developing the Minnesota Guard's sustainable infrastructure has made the Minnesota Guard a pioneer in the use of solar and geothermal energy initiatives. In 2011, Minnesota National Guard facilities set a goal to reduce energy consumption by 3 percent. Forty-one Minnesota National Guard armories participated in this program and energy consumption was reduced by an average of 5.4 percent year over year through the use of geothermal and solar thermal heating, water reuse, solid waste recycling, as well as natural and LED lighting. Furthermore, all new construction projects under Major General Nash's leadership have been designed to LEED standards. These developments are so important because they reduce the Guard's reliance on fossil fuels and foreign oil, support jobs in the local economy, and reduce energy costs for the Guard, allowing them to invest more in our civilian soldier's readiness, training, and education. The work Major General Nash has done to prepare for future energy and sustainability challenges has ensured that the Minnesota National Guard will continue to lead the country on the battlefield and at home.  Finally, I want to note with my gratitude Major General Nash's many years of service as a judge in my annual poetry contest that allows Minnesota students to write about a military veteran who has made a difference in their lives. Each year, he spends hours reading these heartfelt poems and helping me decide which ones will hang in my Senate office.  I would like to extend my best wishes to Major General Nash upon his retirement and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Thank you, General Your service to our Nation and our State has been indispensable and invaluable. Above all, it has made a difference to the men and women who served under you.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS6999-2.txt,1969,SOUTH CAROLINA PEANUT PARITY ACT OF 2017,2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would also like to thank Senator Johnson for marshaling together the resources of the Senate to bring this legislation to a head.  I ran for public office because I was tired of the government playing too large a role in the decisions people make in their private lives, in their homes, and in their businesses. We live in a world today where the government wants to tell you where you have got to send your kids to school, what kind of healthcare plan you have got to buy, what regulations you have to comply with, and how much money they are going to take out of your paycheck each and every month.  I certainly don't think the government ought to play a role in deciding how someone deals with treatment at the end of life. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Right to Try Act with Representative Biggs, Representative Fitzpatrick, and so many others. My frustration lies with any regime, regulatory or otherwise, that would impair a patient's decision to use any medication to be able to alleviate their symptoms or improve their quality of life in their final days.  It is absolutely ludicrous to me that, in today's world, we don't allow terminally ill people in every corner of this great country to be able to use medical cannabis to alleviate their pain and suffering, particularly at the end of life.  It is so frustrating to me that the Federal Government has lied to this country for a generation about medical cannabis, saying that it has no medical value. Well, I can tell you, Mr.Speaker, that is absolutely not true. I have met with patients in my district who have received terminal diagnoses, who have been told by their doctors not to buy green bananas, and yet those folks courageously move forward trying to be a part of their own treatment and to be a part of their own clinical plan moving forward.  Too often, doctors, whether it is at the VA or in private practice, aren't able to counsel their patients and give them advice and comfort that there is a substance in medical cannabis which has proven in some circumstances to have medical value.  Stage IV of terminal cancer includes symptoms like loss of appetite, which can be helped by cannabis, chronic pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chemotherapy-induced nausea. All of these things can be helped by medical cannabis.  Those who are in stage III of AIDS have sleeplessness and weight loss that can be helped by medical cannabis.  Cannabis has shown great promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's, Crohn's Disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, where there are refractory seizures, at times, 30 or 40 seizures a day.  Mr.Speaker, in this great country, we will have people who will receive terminal diagnoses each and every day. I say let's get the government out of their way.

It certainly seems like Speaker Ryan has come around to President Trump's way of thinking. Republicans are planning to add $1.5 trillion to our national debt, and they couldn't be happier about it.

Republicans only care about debt when they want to slash Social Security and Mr.Speaker, Republicans only care about debt and are only fiscally responsible when there is a Democrat in the White  The American people are now seeing right through this hypocrisy, just like they see right through Donald Trump's excuses about his tax returns.

Justice Eid now serves on the Colorado Supreme I have known Justice Eid since the time I was a young law student, 6 foot 4 and with black hair. That is how long I have known Justice I am very honored to have worked with her.  I know that a lot of my classmates who had her as a professor are people who shared political perspectives that were far different from Justice Eid's, but they never criticized her teaching. They always found her to be openminded and open to debate of other's views.  Most importantly, what Justice Eid will do, once confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court, is to make sure that she rules based on the law, not on personal opinion or preferences but how the law dictates. That is the kind of judge she will be and continues to be, from the supreme court to the circuit court.

498,topic-id,2781,"Mr.President, I rise today to add my voice and my strong support for the confirmation of Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid as the next U.court of appeals judge for the Tenth Circuit Court, which, of course, is housed in Denver,  There is no doubt that Justice Eid is superbly qualified for this position. For the past decade, she has served Colorado as a justice on the supreme court. In 2008, Justice Eid was overwhelmingly retained by the people of We have a system where every decade the voters of Colorado vote to retain or dismiss a judge, and every time that has come before the people of Colorado, she has been overwhelmingly retained by the people of  Prior to her appointment, Justice Eid represented the State of Colorado before the State federal courts as our State solicitor general. She served as a tenured member of the faculty at the University of Colorado Law School, where she taught courses in constitutional law, legislation, torts, and she has published scholarly articles on topics such as constitutional federalism and tort law, in addition to being a clerk on the Supreme She also practiced commercial and appellate litigation at the Denver office of the national law firm Arnold and  She began her legal career as a clerk to Judge Jerry Smith on the U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth Her law experience took her to the U.Supreme Court under Clarence Prior to attending law school, Justice Eid was a special assistant and speechwriter for the U.Secretary of Education, Bill She received her law degree from the University of Chicago Law School, where she was the articles editor of the Law She graduated with high honors and as a member of the Order of the She received her degree in American studies from Stanford University, graduating with distinction as a member of Phi Beta  What her resume clearly shows is that whatever Justice Eid does, she does it at the highest level, with the best results. She has specialized knowledge of federalism, water law, and Indian law, among other important areas of the law. Indeed, the National Native American Bar Association has even noted that she has ``significantly more experience with Indian law cases than any other recent Circuit Court nominee.''  We have had some pretty doggone good circuit court nominees in the past, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, whose seat she will be filling on the Tenth Circuit These are concepts that are critical to my home State of Colorado, and her expertise will prove to be invaluable to the Tenth Circuit Court, as well as to the Nation and the people of this country.  But as impressive as her credentials are, it is her demeanor and her approach to the law that make her ideally suited for the court. Justice Eid has been called a ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner.'' She is also, as her former law clerks have noted, ``fiercely independent,'' and she will decide cases ``as she believes the law requires.'' At the same time, she seeks out different viewpoints and wants to understand all sides of the issue she addresses.  That is the law professor I know from my days at the University of Colorado School of I can say from that experience that while Justice Eid has her perspectives on the law, she cares very deeply about robust debate and hearing the views of others. And I know from my classmates who had Justice Eid as their professor--those classmates didn't always agree with her perspectives, but Justice Eid was open to their debate and hearing their views. She engaged them, and she was never biased against differing perspectives but always applying the law as the law required, not as opinions suited.  I also know that ``fiercely independent'' jurist whom her former clerks spoke so highly of. Justice Eid will follow the law regardless of the popular wind, regardless of personal opinion. Whether considering the plain meaning of a statute, discerning the proper role of the courts, the legislative branch, or the executive and its agencies, or evaluating the relationships between the Federal Government and the States, Justice Eid will side with what the law says, and she will do it in that commonsense, western way that clearly and articulately tells the American people what the law is.  I am privileged to know Justice I have known her for a number of years now from my days as a student at the University of Colorado School of Law and through her work in the State of Colorado at the time that I served in the State legislature. She is an incredible human being with a delightful demeanor that will suit the court well.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several letters in support of Justice Eid's nomination: a letter to Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein from former law clerks of Justice Eid's, as well as a letter from various supporters in Colorado and one letter from the Southern Ute Indian  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 13, 2017.       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: We are      all of Justice Eid's former law clerks (except those      currently clerking for a federal judge and not permitted to      sign) since she began her tenure on the Colorado Supreme      Court in 2006, and we write to give our fullest support to      her nomination to be a judge on the United States Court of      Appeals for the Tenth We come from a diverse set of      geographic, economic, cultural, and political backgrounds,      yet we are united in our belief that Justice Eid is a jurist      and a person of the highest caliber and character. We have      each learned so much from her.       Justice Eid was raised by a single mother in Spokane,      Washington under challenging circumstances, after her father      abandoned her family. Justice Eid began college at the      University of Idaho, but with the support and encouragement      of her mother and a professor there, Justice Eid transferred      to Stanford University where she graduated with distinction      and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. After      Stanford, she served as a speechwriter to President Ronald      Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, and then      went on to attend the University of Chicago Law School, where      she served as Articles Editor on the Law Review, graduated      with High Honors, and was elected Order of the Justice      Eid began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Jerry      Smith on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth      She then served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence      Thomas on the United States Supreme       In private practice at Arnold and Porter following her      clerkships, Justice Eid practiced both commercial and      appellate litigation for a variety of clients. She departed      private practice and joined academia where she became a      tenured professor at the University of Colorado Law School,      teaching Legislation, Constitutional Law, and Torts, and      serving as the faculty clerkship advisor. During her time at      the University of Colorado, Justice Eid continued her service      in[[Page S6946]]     the Colorado legal community as President of the Colorado      Association of Corporate In 2005 she was appointed      by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to serve as the      Solicitor General of One year later, Governor Bill      Owens appointed Justice Eid to the Colorado Supreme Court      where she has served for 11 years and was successfully      retained by the voters of Colorado on a statewide ballot.       As law clerks we had the distinct privilege and opportunity      to learn by observing Justice Eid throughout her decision      making process. We learned that she never fails to provide      her full attention and dedication to each individual case,      mastering the relevant facts and carefully analyzing the law,      whether the text of a statute or the words of a contract. As      Justice Eid is so fond of saying, she ``goes where the law      takes her.'' In other words, she treats each case      individually without any preconceived notion of desired      outcome.       As young lawyers, we took particular note of the respect      that Justice Eid shows the parties and their attorneys both      in her written work product and during oral argument. We also      observed her belief in the importance of respect and      collegiality with her colleagues, particularly during times      of disagreement. Her chambers are always open, and she wants      to hear different viewpoints (even ours), but she remains      fiercely independent, ultimately deciding cases as she      believes the law requires. And her opinions do just that--in      clean and succinct prose, time and again, Justice Eid      resolves the dispute between the parties and announces a      clear rule of law that can be readily discerned by future      litigants. Her majority opinions in particular are a      testament to the care, dedication, and consensus-building      attitude she brings to her role as a       While serving as a Justice on the Colorado Supreme Court,      Justice Eid has continued to teach at the University of      She also serves as the Chair of the Supreme Court      Water Court Committee, which works to identify rule and      statutory changes to achieve efficiencies in water court      cases, while maintaining quality outcomes for all. Justice      Eid was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on      the Federal Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules--a      prestigious appointment where she has served alongside      federal judges, law professors, and lawyers to craft      revisions to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure--and by      President George Bush to the Permanent Committee for the      Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise (an organization that writes the      history of the United States Supreme Court and sponsors the      Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture).       Justice Eid is active in her community and church, and as      the mother of two children, Justice Eid has also been      involved in her children's school over the years. In addition      to her service on the Colorado Supreme Court, these other      responsibilities connect her to the Colorado community,      specifically the challenges and issues facing citizens of      this State and will allow her to bring an important      perspective and diverse set of experiences to the United      States Court of Appeals for the Tenth       Her qualifications to serve are unparalleled and speak for      themselves. At each stage of her education and career Justice      Eid has excelled at the highest levels and has received      praise, awards, and the utmost respect of her colleagues and      those who have worked for her. This is in no small part due      to her incredible work ethic and her leadership by example.      And we as law clerks have carefully observed and learned from      her simultaneous and unfaltering commitment to both her      family and her position on the Colorado Supreme       We close by reflecting on our fond memories of our      experiences as law clerks under Justice Eid, whether it was a      lunch to celebrate a birthday, officiating numerous of our      weddings, or the annual holiday and summer parties that she      hosts. We all remember the genuine interest and support      Justice Eid provided to us as people and new lawyers. We will      never forget her heartfelt appreciation for our hard work and      the care and time she has taken to guide us through our      clerkships and beyond. She has been an important and      steady mentor in each of our lives. We urge the Senate to      take swift action on her nomination and are available to      speak to any member or their staff about Justice Eid and      her qualifications to serve on the United States Court of      Appeals for the Tenth       Sincerely,        Marie Williams, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2006-07; Holly      Sterrett, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2006-07; Jared Butcher,      Clerk for Justice Eid, 2007-08; Clark Smith, Clerk for      Justice Eid, 2008-09; Kate Field, Clerk for Justice Eid,      2009-10; Tim Zimmerman, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2010-11; Lee      Fanyo, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2011-12; Jon Gillam, Clerk for      Justice Eid, 2011-12; Jake Durling, Clerk for Justice Eid,      2012-13; Doug Marsh, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2013-14; Jamen      Tyler, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2014-15; Ben Fischer, Clerk for      Justice Eid, 2014-15; Chris Chrisman, Clerk for Justice Eid,      2006-07; Catherine Bazile, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2007-08.

This incredibly diverse group of attorneys      agrees on one thing: we all agree that Justice Eid is      exceptionally well qualified and should be confirmed.       We know Justice Eid to be a person of integrity,      professional competence, and judicial temperament. She has      received the highest possible `Well Qualified' rating from      the American Bar Her private practice work,      scholarship, law teaching, and service as Colorado's      Solicitor General have all demonstrated her superb abilities      over many years. Her service on the Colorado Supreme Court      has earned her a reputation as an excellent jurist. Her      strong work ethic is renowned. She is a preeminent member of      the legal profession, not only in Colorado, but in the United      States more broadly, with outstanding legal ability and      exceptional breadth of experience. We also know her to be a      compassionate and caring person, deeply involved in the      broader community and called to service, not only in her day      job, but through her extensive volunteerism toward the      betterment of the profession. Throughout her tenure on the      bench, she has hired numerous diverse law clerks and      continuously sought to ensure that the diverse voices of      Coloradoans are heard, evincing a very strong commitment to      diversity and inclusion. We are excited to see her bring her      spirit and skill set to the Tenth       We ask that Colorado's Senators join together and support      this very highly qualified nominee from We believe      it is an exceptional moment to confirm Justice Eid as the      first Colorado woman to serve on the Tenth           Respectfully,       Sarah Auchterlonie, Franklin Azar, Naomi Beer, Michael      Bender, Heath Briggs, Geraldine Brimmer, Scott Campbell,      Richard Cunningham, Stanton Dodge, Caleb Durling, Jacob      Durling, John Echohawk, David Fine, Jeremy Graves, Melissa      Hart, Ellen Herzog, Neal Katyal, Martin Katz, Robert Kaufman,      Kenzo Kawanabe, Kevin       Liz Krupa, Bradley Levin, Cedric Logan, Monica      Loseman, Victoria Lovato, Rebecca Love Kourlis, Cynthia      Mares, Michael McLachlan, Mary Mullarkey, Marc Musyl,      Habib Nasrullah, Chris Neumann, Neil Oberfeld, Angelica      Ochoa, Michael O'Donnell, Michele On-ja Choe, Peter Ortego,      David Palmer, Joseph Peters, Richard Petkun, John            James Prochnow, Lee Reichert, Harriet McConnell Retford,      Tom Sansonetti, Cliff Stricklin, Trent Tanner, Robert      Thompson, III, Lorenzo Trujillo, John Voorhees, John Wahl,      Rebecca Watson, Dee Wisor, Jennifer Weddle, Kristin White,      Heather Whiteman Runs Him, Evan Williams, David Wilson,      Maureen Witt, David Yun, John                                  ____                                    Southern Ute Indian Tribe,                                       Ignacio, CO, July 21, 2017.

As a Colorado      Supreme Court Justice, Justice Eid has demonstrated expertise      in a broad spectrum of legal matters including the field of      federal Indian law. Justice Eid's judicial record evidences      her understanding of tribal sovereignty and other matters      that are acutely important to the Because these      matters are often resolved in the Supreme Court following a      decision in a federal appellate circuit in the West, it is      critical that the judges on those circuit courts possess a      working understanding of Indian law issues. Because she is      well-versed in the established principles of federal Indian      law, as well as many other areas of the law, the Tribe      supports the nomination of Justice           Sincerely,                                                 Clement Frost,                                                          ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945.txt,1E+14,1445,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This letter was sent to me and my colleague, Senator Bennet from This letter was titled ``Support for the Confirmation of Justice Allison Eid to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals,'' which I have[[Page S6947]]submitted for the Record, but I want to highlight some of the people who have signed this letter because when it comes to the courts and nominations, I think it is very important that we listen to the voices of those people who are closest to the court over which the nominee may be presiding. It is also important that those who are closest to a practicing lawyer provide their opinions of a lawyer who has been nominated for the bench who is not already on the bench.  In the case of Justice Eid's supporters, there is an incredible list of people from across the political spectrum--both sides of the aisle--supporting Justice Let me talk about a few of Justice Eid's supporters, because we will hear a lot of debate about groups who support or oppose Justice Eid, but the people who know her the best, the people who have practiced before her court, the people who have worked with her over the many years of public service that she has provided don't just fall on the Republican side of the aisle or the Democratic side of the aisle, the support she has gathered is from across the political spectrum.  There is Michael Bender, former Colorado Supreme Court justice; Justice Rebecca Love Kourlis, one of the most respected jurists in Colorado, who served on the State supreme court and is one of the most highly regarded justices not only in Colorado but across the country, quite frankly; Justice Mary Justice Mullarkey is no longer on the Colorado Supreme Court, but she served as the chief justice of the Colorado Supreme She was appointed by a Democratic She is someone who believes Justice Eid would be an incredible addition to the court. There is Neal Katyal, a former Department of Justice civil servant for the Obama administration--a U.Solicitor General, in fact.

350,topic-id,907,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Mitchell, for his leadership in this amazingly important area, and also to point out the bipartisan nature of this bill not only, Mr.Speaker, to you, but to those people who might be watching at home at a time when it seems that we can't agree on anything, here we have an agreement in a College Transparency Act in how to ensure a better investment for the futures of our children.  Now, there are those who have opposed this bill, and I can't really wrap my brain around it, Mr.Someone suggested that this might grow government. But that is absolutely not true. As a matter of fact, the data that would be made available in this act is already collected. But the problem is that that data is collected, and then it is siloed and accessible only to institutions or government entities and not to the end user. That strikes me as illogical, at best, and stupid, at worst.  Someone says it burdens colleges with data collection requirements, yet, again, the data is already being collected. What about personal privacy? Does it disclose individuals' private information? Well, if it did, I wouldn't be standing here today extolling the virtues of this bill which I cosponsored and Mr.Mitchell sponsors that support it again across the aisle to include the likes of the distinguished gentleman, Mr.Polis, from  Instead of disclosing personal data of individuals, it discloses metadata of groups so what we would learn, for example, is that individuals who majored in X at college Y had an employment rate of Z, and that their earning potential was A as opposed to another university where it might be  What more pertinent information, Mr.Speaker, could there be to young people as they seek to choose an area of study and a place to engage in that area of study than their likelihood of success based on those who have done the same thing at the same college or university before them?  So we have addressed some of the things that this bill doesn't do, but let's speak briefly about what it does do. Without any ability to articulately argue, this bill increases transparency. When you step aside from the realm of national security, I can think of no reason that the Federal or State or local government should be in the business of collecting data that they don't share with the citizens who put them in office or the people who fund their endeavors. Indeed, this isn't national security, unless you contemplate the fact that right now our children attend universities deprived of information that might help them make better choices.  So this increases transparency. It creates informed consumers. It allows individuals to decide for themselves which college or university might offer a program that they are interested in, is the best investment of their time, and perhaps their or their parents' or the government's money. It informs payers to that very end, whether that payer is the student, a family member, or the State of which they are a resident. It gives us a return on the investment.  The fact that this data has been collected low these many years, and it took the leadership of Mr.Mitchell and good folks like Jared Polis working across the aisle to get us to this point, is lamentable, but we have the opportunity in the College Transparency Act to correct these wrongs, not to reburden our universities with more data collection requirements, but to take the data that is already being collected and give it to the end users, the students.  So it is with that that I again offer a hearty congratulations to Congressman Mitchell, a begrudging ``I wish I had thought of that,'' and I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that while we already collect this data, we do not disseminate it where it would be most useful, and that is to the end users. I hope that all can find a way to join us from both parties in supporting this commonsense measure, the College Transparency  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the president of the University of Virginia in my district.

The College Transparency Act is a step in the right      direction for improving federal data, which is currently      limited, and at times, inaccurate. Improving data helps      students and families with the important decisions associated      with choosing a college, and also helps institutions of      higher education improve student success.

726,topic-id,712,"Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter of support for the legislation from the National Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association, and a statement of support from the former Chief of the Forest Service, Tom     NLBMDA Praises Reintroduction of Resilient Federal Forests Act       Washington, DC.--The National Lumber and Building Material      Dealers Association (NLBMDA) praises the introduction      yesterday of the Resilient Federal Forests Act by (H.2936)      Bruce Westerman (R-AR). The legislation helps protect      the national forest system by implementing best practices      intended to lessen the threat of wildfires. Original      cosponsors for the bipartisan bill include Raul      Labrador (R-ID), Tom McClintock (R-CA), Cathy McMorris      Rodgers (R-WA), Rick Nolan (D-MN), Collin Peterson (D-MN),      and Scott Tipton (R-CO).       Westerman introduced the legislation during the      previous Congress in 2015, where it passed the House of      Representatives by a vote of 262-167 with support from 21      Democrats who crossed the aisle to support the bill.       The U.Forest Service manages over 190 million acres. Of      this, 46 million acres is designated as allowable for timber      harvest. Timber harvests from federal forests declined by 78      percent between 1987 and 2015, from 11.3 to 2.5 billion board      feet. This is far below the long-term, sustainable capability      of these lands of 12.2 billion board feet per year.       Poor land management during the past 30 years has led to      declining health of national forests. This has resulted in      fewer jobs and productivity in the forestry sector, fewer      board feet of domestically produced lumber entering the      market, and a marked increase in acreage ravaged by insects,      disease and fire.       ``The Resilient Federal Forests Act strikes a balanced      approach in managing the national forest system by making      more land available for logging in an environmentally      sustainable way,'' said Jonathan Paine, NLBMDA President and      ``NLBMDA thanks Congressman Westerman for his leadership      on this important issue.''       NLBMDA supports greater sustainable harvesting of federal      forests to meet long-term demand for lumber as part of a      comprehensive plan that does not place U.private forests      at a competitive disadvantage.                                  ____Statement of Tom Tidwell, Chief, U.Department of Agriculture, Forest                                 Service  Submitted to THE HOUSE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON        FEDERAL LANDS on THE RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT OF 2017       Mr.Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for      the opportunity to present a statement regarding the      Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. The U.Forest      Service is currently reviewing this discussion draft, and the      Administration does not have a position on it at this time.       We appreciate the significant work the Subcommittee put      into this bill since it was last introduced in the 114th      We also appreciate your efforts to incorporate      Forest Service comments and recommendations and are      encouraged by many of the goals outlined within this bill. We      look forward to continuing to work with you and your staffs      on the details to ensure this legislation results in      meaningful improvements to forest management work on the      ground.       The Forest Service welcomes legislation that expands the      toolset we can use to restore our nation's forests while      staying within the boundaries and intent of the National      Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species      Forest restoration projects provide rural jobs, mitigate the      severity of wildfires, enhance watershed conditions, and      ensure a variety of other economic, social and environmental      benefits for the American people. Provisions that expand      categorical exclusions, incentivize collaboration, and      streamline environmental analysis or consultation with other      federal agencies are all important issues in the bill that we      are reviewing.       It is notable that the Resilient Federal Forests Act does      not contain provisions that would mandate harvest levels,      require a new layer of zoning on the National Forests, or      elevate one use over another on these multiple-use lands, as      we have seen in other recent forestry bills.       While we support efforts to provide new tools to improve      forest management and restoration, capacity constraints,      including the present approach to budgeting for wildfire,      continue to be impediments to increasing the pace and scale      of this work. We look forward to continuing to work with you      on the wildfire title to find a solution that addresses the      disproportionate growth of fire programs as a share of the      agency's overall budget.       Again, I thank you for the opportunity to provide this      statement. The Forest Service stands ready to continue      working with you on this important legislation.

890,topic-id,819,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the disaster supplemental that the Trump administration is expected to send to Congress as early as tomorrow. While Congress has passed two supplemental aid bills since this year's hurricanes, I want to make it very clear that what we have already passed is not even close to what we will need to help Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands fully recover and rebuild.  Hurricane Maria destroyed their power grids and has significantly damaged their water infrastructure so as to make clean drinking water dangerously scarce. Three of Puerto Rico's biggest industries--manufacturing, finance, and tourism, which drive their already struggling economy--remain severely damaged because the hurricane wiped out so many factories, buildings, and hotels. Many Puerto Ricans who had jobs the day before Maria struck no longer have anywhere to go to work. In other words, in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, this is not just a natural disaster; it is also an economic disaster that these local governments cannot dig out of on their own. Our fellow citizens desperately need our help.  Listen to what one New Yorker told me about how dangerous things are right now, especially for the sick and elderly.  My constituent was trying to help someone in Puerto Rico who was autistic and bedridden and under the care of his 93-year-old father. He needed surgery. He was taken to at least three separate medical facilities, and he spent countless hours in an ambulance with his elderly father. He was transported from one location to the next, but the medical facilities were finding it extremely difficult to communicate with each other. After all of that, his doctor could not find any facility on the island that would accept him into its care. He was finally able to get his treatment, but how many more people are still waiting for help?  Another of my constituents is struggling to help her father, who is in a rural area of Puerto She has only been able to speak to him briefly and exchange limited text messages. Her father suffers from heart issues and glaucoma, and he may need a prescription refill very soon if not right now. There are countless more stories just like these throughout my State and, no doubt, in many of my colleagues' States as well.  The $36 billion that is for all of Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands is just not enough. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, it cost the Federal Government $120 billion to rebuild the Gulf That is the amount of funding that we need to be thinking about for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands right now.  It will take at least $5 billion just to rebuild Puerto Rico's power grid, and that will not even cover improvements to make the system more resilient and more efficient than it was before the storm. Right now, two-thirds of Puerto Rico still does not have power. That means no refrigeration so that people can have food to eat or can keep medicine from spoiling. It means no electricity for oxygen tanks in nursing homes and no lights at night to keep people safe. It will take additional funding to restore roads so that whatever supplies do make it to Puerto Rico can actually be delivered, and people can get to their loved ones in need.  The Small Business Administration will need billions of dollars to help people rebuild their businesses, which are vital to their basic economic recovery. The Army Corps of Engineers will need funding and the authority to rebuild the dams and the ports that were damaged so that commerce can actually go on, and FEMA will likely need $8 billion more just to respond to all of the households that have requested assistance to repair and rebuild their homes through its Individual Assistance Program.[[Page S6902]]  In other words, the recovery effort must be massive. There is no way around it, because we can never turn our backs on fellow citizens, whether they are in New York or Texas or Florida or the U.Virgin Islands or Puerto What we need right now is a Marshall That is the only way that Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands are ever going to really fully recover. A new Marshall Plan would help Puerto Rico greatly reduce its crushing debt owned by hedge funds, and a new Marshall plan would also completely modernize infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, by rebuilding their energy grid, hospitals, roads and bridges, reservoirs, schools, dams, and the thousands of buildings and homes that were destroyed by these hurricanes.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in this effort. We must never stop fighting for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands to get the funding they need to fully recover and fully rebuild.

575,topic-id,747,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado (Mr.Buck) for taking the opportunity to highlight some of the good work the House has accomplished this year. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to build on these accomplishments so that Congress as a whole can keep their promises to the American people.  As Congress continues to face the preeminent task of repairing our Nation's healthcare system, first and foremost, we must establish the proper foundation for a competitive and consumer-driven health insurance marketplace. The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017 will restore the application of Federal antitrust and competition laws to the health insurance industry.  Ending the special interest exemption is the first step to broader healthcare reform. Popular cost-reducing reform priorities, such as selling insurance across State lines and developing diverse consumer-driven plans, are predicated on the robust competitive markets this bill will ensure.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 exempted the insurance industry from the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, acts that have the purpose of ensuring fair competition. This broad exemption was intended to assist the newly developing business of insurance so that those companies could set sustainable premiums by permitting data sharing between insurance companies.  However, after 70 years, it is apparent that the broad-stroked exemption created by Congress in the 1940s was not wise. Over the decades, and expeditiously since the passage of ObamaCare in 2009, the health insurance market has devolved into one of the least transparent and most anticompetitive industries in the United  It is clear that the continued exemption of the health insurance industry from the full application of the Federal antitrust laws has had an unfair impact on consumers. It shows up as artificially higher premiums, unfair insurance restrictions, harmful policy exclusions, and simply no diversity of choice.  These antiquated exemptions are no longer necessary. There is no reason in law, policy, or logic for the health insurance industry to have special exemptions that are different from all other businesses in the United  Repeal of the specific section of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which applies only to health insurance, has strong bipartisan support. A form of this legislation passed the Democratic-controlled House during the 111th Congress by a vote of 406-19 and passed the Republican-led House in the 112th Congress by a voice vote.  Similar legislation has been introduced by multiple Democratic Members of the House, and the text of my bill has been included in the Republican Study Committee's healthcare reform bill for the last four Congresses in a row.  In March of this year, this pro-market reform received its biggest show of support yet, passing by an overwhelming majority of 416-7. Now, when 416 Members of the House agree, it sends a strong call to action in the  As a dentist, I know how important robust competition is to dynamic and effective health insurance. It should protect the patient as well as the healthcare provider. It should uniformly apply associated checks and balances that incentivize competition and prevent monopolies. Today, in the healthcare market, those equally applied antitrust protections just simply don't exist.  I don't have a crystal ball that will tell you what the future holds for healthcare or what it will look like. I don't think anybody knows. But I can tell you that history is an important guide. The 70-year antitrust exemption for health insurance has strangled competition and resulted in a consolidated, anticompetitive, and nontransparent scheme controlled by seven megacorporations. That is not what we want for our future.  Instead, let's liberate the market by removing this antitrust exemption. Imagine what could exist when we put the patient first and demand that health insurance companies compete for their business. This market should be patient-centric, patient-focused, and provide a variety of affordable, quality options that empower patient involvement and accountability.  The passage of the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act into law is an important first step toward increasing competition in the health insurance market and will assist in setting the foundation for real competitive and patient-centered healthcare reform.  I thank my friends in the House for their strong support, and at the same time, promises were made in the Senate to get a vote on the Senate floor. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to build upon the good work of this Chamber and do their part to restore competition in the health insurance industry.

734,topic-id,1637,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, introduced by my friend and colleague Bruce  Our forests and the communities that live, work, and rely on them desperately need improved management practice to reduce these forest fire disasters and to increase resiliency.  I was very pleased with the quick work by my friend and former colleague OMB Director Mick Mulvaney for addressing the wildfire funding crisis at the United States Forest Service, requesting $576.5 million for wildfire suppression and recommending active management reforms.  Now, while the Trump administration came through in a big way for Western communities that have been ravaged by catastrophic wildfires, Congress must pass H.2936 and get serious about combating catastrophic wildfires before they get started.  The Resilient Federal Forests Act is a bipartisan, comprehensive piece of legislation that simplifies the cumbersome planning process and reduces the cost of implementing proactive forest management strategies.  H.2936 empowers local communities by getting them involved in the decisionmaking process. It empowers Tribal communities to be part of the solution and help reduce the risk of wildfire.  The bill removes incentives for extreme special interest groups to file frivolous lawsuits. In fact, it requires litigants opposing active management projects to propose an alternative plan as opposed to just saying ``no.'' Imagine that, solutions over lawsuits.[[Page H8335]]  Mismanagement has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease and ripe for catastrophic wildfires. It is clear the system is broken. Western communities are tired of being victims, and this bill allows us to be proactive and to prevent disasters before they become a risk.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record two letters, one from the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the second from the National Association of Home Builders, in support of H.2936.         Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies,                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.

All 50 state agencies are members of      the Founded in 1902, the Association's mission      is to protect the interests and authorities of the states to      manage fish and wildlife within their borders, including on      federal land. The Association works closely with the federal      land management agencies to deliver on the ground      conservation of fish, wildlife and their habitats for our      citizens.       The Association is particularly appreciative of changes      made by the Committee staff at the request of the      These changes make more prominent in federal      statute the states' authority to manage fish and wildlife on      U.Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management      (BLM) lands. Nothing in the amended language is intended to      change any existing federal, state or tribal authority. It      simply makes more evident the state-federal jurisdictional      relationship which Congress has affirmed. Federal-state      cooperation in this arena is compelled because the USFS and      BLM own the land and thus the habitat, and the state fish and      wildlife agencies manage the fish and wildlife. Robust      cooperation will provide that both land/habitat objectives      and fish and wildlife population objectives are met.       The RFFA is vitally needed to restore the health of our      Nation's federal forests on USFS and BLM lands.      Unfortunately, the USFS and BLM have fallen significantly      behind in meeting objectives for early successional stage      forest habitat, for a number of reasons. Significantly,      federal court decisions and increasing uninformed litigation      has created ``paralysis by analysis'' to quote a former USFS      Congress mandated that the federal forests were to be      managed for water quality, wildlife habitat, recreation, and      timber harvest. Active forest management by the federal      professional managers in cooperation with the state fish and      wildlife agency professional managers has been replaced by      natural resource management decisions being made by the      federal courts. A return to active forest management will      facilitate realization of all of the public values of federal      forests.       The Association much appreciates that the fire-borrowing      problem is addressed in HR 2936. While most catastrophic      fires occur in the western United States, this is a national      problem because the funds for every national forest and      public land unit are affected. This remedy will prevent the      USFS and BLM from having to borrow from other appropriated      line-items (for example, wildfire prevention, wildlife,      recreation and water quality) to pay for the cost of      catastrophic fire suppression, which cost consumes over 50%      of the USFS budget. We respectfully urge the Committee to      further protect the USFS budget by capping the 10-year      average cost of catastrophic fire costs at its current level.      The 10-year average is used by the USFS in building their      budget request. The 10-year average continues to rise and      unless it is capped it will continue to erode other important      budget line items such as wildlife, water quality, fire      prevention and recreation in the President's budget.       The Association further appreciates the process relief      provided to National Forest Plans (NFP) and (potentially)      Resource Management Plans (RMP) developed by collaborative      deliberation. It is appropriate that a collaborative-     developed plan, which often takes years to deliberate and      conclude, be subject to only two options under NEPA, proceed      or not proceed. It is very reasonable to assume that the      collaboratively deliberated process has examined and rejected      the other options, and only the action or no action need be      analyzed.       The bill's establishment of a pilot binding arbitration      process as an alternative to litigation in each FS Region is      certainly welcomed by the Not only is the cost      of defending the land management plan a burden on the      agencies, but the planned for management work on the ground      is lost, perhaps never to be resurrected on that site. We      commend Congressman Westerman and the Committee for settling      on this significant improvement to litigation reform that was      in HR 2647 from the last       We also appreciate the increase in acreage ceilings for the      statutorily endorsed Categorical Exclusions (CEs) under      CEs must avoid sensitive areas and must be consistent with      standards and guidelines in Forest Early forest      successional stage habitat, for instance, cannot be just      incidental to be effective in providing habitat for deer,      elk, wild turkey, neo-tropical migratory songbirds and other      species which are dependent on this habitat type. While an      acreage ceiling is an easy metric to measure success, the      desired forest future condition should really determine the      size of the timber harvest.       Additionally, the Association supports the proposed common-     sense amendments to the Endangered Species First, H.     2936 overturns the Cottonwood decision, which directs that if      additional critical habitat is designated under an approved      FP or RMP, a section 7 programmatic re-consultation of the      entire FP needs to be done. The U.Fish and Wildlife      Service (USFWS) and the Obama Administration argued that the      section 7 consultation needs only to be done on the project      covering the additionally designated acreage of critical      habitat. This remedy will greatly reduce the debilitating      process that the federal court decision directs. Second, the      bill affirms that no ESA section 7 consultation is required      if the USFS or BLM determine during informal consultation      that the proposed action is ``not likely to adversely affect      a species or designated critical habitat'', which is already      USFWS policy.

Rob Bishop,     Chairman, House of Representatives, Committee on Natural          Resources, Washington,       Dear Chairman Bishop: On behalf of the more than 140,000      members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),      I am writing to express NAHB's strong support for The      Resilient National Forests Act of 2017 and express our      appreciation to the House Committee on Natural Resources for      continuing this important discussion on the health of our      nation's forest. Better forest management practices that are      also mindful of environmental considerations will help      strengthen the housing supply chain and promote affordable      housing opportunities for all       Significant concerns have been raised about the U.Forest      Service's current forest management efforts, both in terms of      administrative obstacles and legal obstacles in approving      timber harvesting projects. Consequently, less commercial      harvesting of timber has resulted in overgrown forests and an      increased risk of catastrophic wildfire across the country.       Additional commercial harvesting of timber will promote the      health of our nation's forest system, but also positively      impact housing affordability. NAHB research shows lumber and      wood products account for 15% of the cost of construction for      a single family house. Lumber prices are generally volatile,      and it is common for builders to encounter a large price      swing in a short period of time. As additional supply is      brought into the market, upward pressure on lumber prices      will soften.       NAHB urges the House Natural Resources Committee to support      The Resilient National Forests Act of 2017, which will      encourage multi-use forest management practices for national      forests and provide increases in the supply of federal timber      products.       Thank you for considering our views.

But being pro-life doesn't mean that I am just antiabortion. It also means that I support the right to try, because life at all stages is worth fighting for.  Every year, over 1 million Americans die from terminal illnesses, many of whom pass away while waiting for the FDA to approve a drug that could dramatically change their prognosis, while others die in the hopeless cycle of trying and trying again to gain acceptance into a medical trial.  Think about that: we are losing millions of Americans at the hands of government red tape.  Now, as a healthcare provider for 25 years, I know firsthand how important innovation is to the medical community. The Right to Try Act, if made into law, will give hope to the child with leukemia whose doctors have exhausted all other treatment options. It opens previously locked doors by allowing healthcare providers to try experimental drugs as a last-ditch effort for survival.  The experiments that the Right to Try Act will allow for have the potential to lead to many more birthdays, more piano recitals, and more camping trips, and offer hope for our future, hope for years to come.  But don't take my word for it. Emily Whitehead was merely 5 years old when she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and her doctors quickly realized that she was among a small percentage of patients whose disease was seemingly untouchable by chemotherapy. The Whiteheads were at the end of their rope. The little girl's body was resisting chemotherapy, and the window for many more birthdays, more piano recitals, and more camping trips was wearing thin. Their only option was to join a clinical trial that experimented with T-cell therapy, where Emily could be the first pediatric patient to undergo this treatment.  And do you know what? It worked. Three years later, a groundbreaking study was conducted where 63 patients received T-cell therapy for 1 year, and 52 of them became cancer free, an absolutely unheard-of statistic with this deadly strain of leukemia.  Think about that: 52 lives were saved; 52 families were given another birthday, another piano recital, and another camping trip. What a waste it would have been had they not had the right to try.

505,topic-id,1129,"Mr.President, tomorrow morning the Senate will vote on the nomination of Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison She is going to be voted on to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of She is an eminently qualified and exceptional nominee who has received widespread, bipartisan praise and support.  Justice Eid has spent over a decade on the Colorado Supreme Before her appointment, she served as the Colorado State solicitor general. In that role, she represented the State before both Federal and State courts. She also served as a tenured faculty member at the University of Colorado School of Law, where she taught courses in constitutional law, legislation, and torts. Justice Eid practiced commercial and appellate litigation at Arnold and At the beginning of her legal career, Justice Eid served as a clerk for Judge Jerry Smith on the Fifth Circuit and as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence  Justice Eid was raised by a single mother, whom Eid credits for her significant personal and professional achievements. She earned a scholarship to Stanford and graduated with distinction and is a member of Phi Beta Justice Eid received her law degree from the University of Chicago, where she graduated with high honors and Order of the She has had an impressive legal career, and she has an impressive life story.  In her long and celebrated tenure on the Colorado Supreme Court, Justice Eid has heard roughly 900 cases and written approximately 100 opinions. In 2008, 75 percent of Colorado voters retained Justice Eid to the Colorado Supreme  Her nomination has also received wide, bipartisan support. As an example, Justice Eid's former clerks, who noted that they ``come from a diverse set of geographic, economic, cultural and political backgrounds,'' wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee supporting her nomination. Judges work closely with their law clerks every day. Law clerks understand a judge's deliberative process and approach to the law better than anyone. How did these clerks describe Justice Eid? They said: ``She never fails to provide her full attention and dedication to each individual case, mastering the relevant facts and carefully analyzing the law, whether the text of a statute or the word of a contract.'' Her law clerks also wrote that she goes ``where the law takes her'' and that in their decade of collective experience in over 900 cases, Justice Eid ``treats each case individually without any preconceived notion of desired outcome.''  The National Native American Bar Association also endorsed Justice In their letter to the committee, they noted that she ``has demonstrated deep understanding of Federal Indian law and policy matters, as well as significant respect for the tribes as governments. Such qualities and experiences are rare among nominees to the federal bench.'' They went on to note that ``while we do not expect that Justice Eid will agree with tribal interests on every issue, we also believe that she is immensely well qualified and we are confident that Justice Eid is a mainstream, commonsense Westerner who will rule fairly on Indian Country matters.'' That is from the National Native American Bar I think ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner'' is the perfect way to describe Justice  Despite this bipartisan support and her professional achievements, all the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee voted against her nomination in committee, and I suspect most of the minority will vote against her[[Page S6952]]confirmation when it comes up. That surprised me. Justice Eid received a majority ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, an outside group who evaluates judicial nominees. My colleagues on the other side claim that this group's ratings weigh very heavily in their decision to support or oppose a judicial nominee. In fact, my Democratic colleagues claim that these ratings should carry a great deal of weight with Senators, and they argue that the Judiciary Committee shouldn't hold hearings on nominees who have not yet received ABA ratings.  This week, we are voting on four circuit court nominees--including three women--who received ``well qualified'' ratings from the The American Bar Association rated two of these individuals unanimously ``well qualified.'' Yet the vast majority of my Democratic colleagues voted against the two nominees on whom we have already voted, and I am willing to bet that the other two nominees will see similar opposition from my Democratic colleagues.  Why do my Democratic friends profess such admiration for the American Bar Association's evaluation process and then vote against nominees who received the American Bar Association's ``well qualified'' rating? I would like to see them put their money where their mouth is or maybe, better yet, their vote where their mouth is. If my colleagues believe so strongly in the ABA evaluations, they should start voting for nominees who receive ``well qualified'' ratings, but I suspect they will not.  When the Judiciary Committee voted on Justice Eid's nomination, my Democratic colleagues really stretched to find reasons to oppose that nomination. One of the chief reasons given for opposition to her nomination centered on a quote in a Denver Post article that said Justice Eid has ``earned a reputation of one of [the Colorado Supreme Court's] most conservative members.'' I find that statement to be misleading. Of the seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court, Justice Eid is one of only two justices appointed by a Republican To argue that she is somehow extreme just because she was not appointed by a Democratic Governor is very unfair.  Furthermore, the Denver Post published a subsequent article that disagreed with this characterization. By contrast, the more recent article stated that ``appointment by a Republican or Democrat does not always dictate the ideology of the justice. . . . Even categorizing justices as either conservative or liberal is generally an error.'' I would agree with the Denver Post on this point.  Justice Eid should not be evaluated by her ideological reputation but, rather, by how she approaches issues before her judiciary. That is how I have evaluated Justice Eid and other judicial nominees, and that is why I strongly support her confirmation today.  I am very proud to support the nomination of Justice Allison She is the third in a series of distinguished female circuit court nominees we have had the opportunity to vote on this week. Her impressive experience and numerous accomplishments speak to her qualifications for this role. I commend the President for nominating these outstanding and accomplished women to our circuit courts. Justice Eid is an exceptional nominee, and her record overwhelmingly supports her nomination. As a result, I will support her confirmation tomorrow, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

592,topic-id,1555,"Mr.President, I would like to address the issue we are voting on in a few minutes. The Senate will vote on the nomination of Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of  Though she currently lives in Michigan, Justice Larsen was born in and hails from my State of In fact, she and I share the same alma mater, the University of Northern Iowa, for our bachelor's degrees. I have also learned, since meeting Justice Larsen, that her father was the longtime CEO of the Lutheran Services in He is now retired, but during the time he was the CEO, he was the very same person with whom I often met for breakfast when he would come to Washington to tell us about the concerns of the Lutheran Services in At that time, I never knew I might be speaking in favor of his daughter. I didn't even know of his daughter at that time. So I am proud to see a fellow Iowan and such an eminently qualified nominee be nominated to the Sixth Circuit Court of  For those who may not be familiar with her career and accomplishments, a few minutes will give me an opportunity to share them with you. I think you will find, as I have, that Justice Larsen is particularly well suited to serve as a Federal appellate judge.  Justice Larsen has an outstanding academic record, having received numerous awards during her undergraduate and law school careers. Justice Larsen was a Presidential Scholar at the University of Northern Iowa and graduated with the highest honors. She graduated first in her class at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, where she won the Justice John Paul Stevens Award for Academic Excellence and served as editor of the Northwestern University Law  She began her legal career as a clerk for Judge Sentelle on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and then clerked for Justice Scalia on the U.Supreme Following her clerkships, Justice Larsen joined the DC firm of Sidley Austin, one of the largest law firms in the United Justice Larsen spent 2 years as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, where she provided legal advice to the President and executive agencies on difficult issues of constitutional and statutory interpretation.  Justice Larsen has taught constitutional law and criminal law at the University of Michigan Law School since 1998, where she has earned the respect of faculty members and students alike. She won the Hart Wright Award for Excellence in Teaching early in her teaching career. In addition to her teaching responsibilities, Justice Larsen ran Michigan's clerkship program, helping hundreds of students and alumni pursue clerkships at the Federal and State levels. As an adjunct professor, she continues to run the law school's Moot Court  Her colleagues at the University of Michigan praised Justice Larsen and wrote:       Even among the talented and ambitious lawyers at an elite      law school, Joan stands out for her ability to make the      penetrating insight that untangles some knotty problem of      statutory interpretation or judiciary doctrine. Especially      distinctive, moreover, is the rigor and even-handedness she      brings to her analysis.  I will share one more example from that letter because I think it addresses some of my colleagues' concerns, who are on the other side of the aisle, as to her approach to the law.  Her colleagues wrote:       For those of us who have found ourselves on the opposite      side of a debate with Joan about a case, a statute, or some      broader issue of constitutional history, she has demonstrated      time and again that she is both a gracious and intellectually      honest partner in the collaborative project of figuring      things out. What matters for Joan is not winning but working      out the right answer.  Now I bring emphasis to this last sentence.       Even when you disagree with her, it is impossible not to      respect her and to take pleasure in the process of refining      the issues actually in dispute.  In other words, as I see it, Justice Larsen is and will be a jurist who seeks to find the right answer, never simply one she prefers as a matter of policy.  We can already see from her time on the Michigan Supreme Court that Justice Larsen is a principled jurist with an impressive legal acumen. She has served with distinction on that court since she was appointed in 2015. It happens that she was elected to the position in 2016, in her own right, by a resounding majority, winning every county in Colleagues on the court have praised her sharp legal analysis, her clear and crisp writing, and, most importantly, her work ethic.  Outside the courtroom, Justice Larsen is actively involved in volunteer efforts to serve disadvantaged children, and she works with Michigan's veterans, drugs, sobriety, and mental health court programs.  Some of my colleagues have said they will not support the nomination[[Page S6944]]because Justice Larsen was included on President Trump's short list for the Supreme Is there anything wrong with the President suggesting whom he is going to put on the Supreme Court if he is elected President? If you look at her background, it should be no surprise that she was included on that list. She is an accomplished legal academic, a mainstream jurist, and is well respected on a bipartisan basis throughout the legal community.  Because my colleagues have been concerned about everyone on that list, at her hearing, I asked Justice Larsen when she learned that her name was on that list. She replied: ``The date it was announced . . . it was a complete surprise to me.''  I also asked her about judicial independence and whether she could rule against the President who nominated her.  She replied:       I would have no trouble ruling against the President who      appointed me or any successor President as well. Judicial      independence means one thing, one very simple thing--  At this point I want to emphasize--     and that is putting the law above everything else, the      statutes passed by this body, and the Constitution of the      United So I would have absolutely no trouble, and,      indeed, that would be my duty.  Here is the most outrageous reason I have heard for voting against Justice This should surprise a lot of people. Some in the minority have suggested that she is somehow responsible for outside groups running ads that support her nomination in The claim that she is responsible for the action of an outside group is ridiculous, and the allegation that these ads are in some way a guarantee of how she will rule in the future is the most absurd thing I have heard based upon her answers to my questions.  I find it interesting that my colleagues who are complaining about conservative groups do not seem to have the same concern for groups on the left that are spending money in opposition to these nominees. One such group, Alliance for Justice, routinely issues reports and press releases on judicial nominees. Oftentimes, these so-called reports put forward incendiary and false criticisms of these nominees. My colleagues even make the same incendiary attacks against the nominees as these outside groups do. In other words, they use the same talking points. I do not hear that my colleagues on the other side are up in arms about their spending millions of dollars to oppose nominees.  Of course, some may remember that last year groups on the left coordinated attacks on this I was followed all over Iowa by these groups and their members. They ran ads against me and put up billboards that opposed my election, and that had something to do with the Supreme Court, as one might recall. I don't remember hearing any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle complain about all of the money those groups were spending at that time.  As I have said before, I expect that outside groups on the left and on the right want to have their voices heard in the nomination process. Isn't that something to do with what we call democracy, representative government, freedom of speech, freedom of association? There is nothing wrong with that, whether it is done by the right or the left, but I take issue with complaints from the other side that do not acknowledge that all sides have interest groups that are spending and engaging in the judicial nomination process. It was completely appropriate for Justice Larsen not to wade in on the political debate regarding those political ads. Her answers to those questions were exactly what I would expect an independent nominee to say, particularly if she wants to be independent of any President who appoints her when she is appointed to the bench.  Justice Larsen's nomination is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of lawyers, judges, and academic colleagues. It is easy to see why, for she is an accomplished and well-respected academic. She is a brilliant and independent jurist. Her careful and well-reasoned legal analysis puts her squarely within the mainstream of legal thought. I urge my colleagues, in a few minutes, to vote for her nomination.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

623,topic-id,550,"Mr.President, today Senators Klobuchar, Tillis, Schumer, Durbin and I will introduce legislation to help America's families locate missing loved ones who have Alzheimer's disease, autism or related conditions that may cause them to wander. Congressman Chris Smith will introduce a virtually identical companion bill in the House of Representatives today as well.  Our bill, which was introduced for the first time in the 114th Congress, extends an existing program that helps locate individuals with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. It also adds new support for people with autism.  We have named the legislation in honor of two boys with autism who perished because their condition caused them to wander. One of these children, nine-year-old Kevin Curtis Wills, slipped into Iowa's Raccoon River near a park and tragically drowned in 2008. The other, 14-year-old Avonte Oquendo, wandered away from his school and drowned in New York City's East River a few years ago.  Theirs are not isolated cases. Just a few months ago, a four year-old with autism drowned in a pool after wandering away from her caretakers. We've all read or heard the heartbreaking stories of families frantically trying to locate a missing loved one whose condition caused him or her to wander off.  Our bill will give communities the tools they need to help locate people with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia as well as children with autism spectrum disorders who wander away from their families or caregivers and into dangerous situations.  My home State of Iowa has the fifth highest Alzheimer's death rate in America and we have about 63,000 Iowans living with the disease, according to the Alzheimer's Additionally, the CDC identified 1 in 68 children across the country as having autism spectrum disorders. In Iowa alone, about 8,000 individuals have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.  This bill will make resources available to equip first responders, law enforcement officials, and other community leaders with the training and tools necessary to better prevent and respond to these cases as soon as possible. With better information sharing, communities can play a central role in reuniting autistic children and other individuals who wander with their families.  Finally, the bill will ensure that local law enforcement agencies and nonprofits that educate and train people on how to proactively prevent and locate missing individuals who wander are eligible for grants from the U.Department of These grants will facilitate the development of training and emergency protocols for[[Page S7003]]school personnel, supply first responders with additional information and resources, and make local tracking technology programs available for individuals who may wander from safety because of their condition. Grant funding may also be used to establish or enhance notification and communications systems for the recovery of missing children with autism.

888,topic-id,1882,"Mr.President, today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Notre Dame Law Professor Amy Barrett to serve on the Seventh Circuit Court of She is an eminently qualified and exceptionally bright nominee who has received praise and support across the legal profession. She clerked for Judge Silberman on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and for Justice Scalia on the Supreme She has experience in private practice and many years as a law professor teaching classes on constitutional Law, Federal courts, statutory interpretation, among others. She was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to sit on the Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, where she served for 6 years.  Her nomination has also received wide support. For example, in a letter to the Judiciary Committee, a bipartisan group of law professors encouraged the committee to confirm her nomination, saying that Professor Barrett ``enjoys wide respect for her careful work, fair-minded disposition, and personal integrity.'' Her colleagues at Notre Dame described her ``as a model of the fair, impartial, and sympathetic judge.''  Despite this, all the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee voted against her nomination in committee, and I suspect most of the minority will vote against her confirmation later today. This, of course, is a shame, and it does not speak well of our institution, the U.Senate, and I would like to explain why.  When the Judiciary Committee voted on Professor Barrett's nomination, I listened to the reasons my colleagues gave for voting against her. Some said that she didn't have enough experience to be a circuit court judge. Well, the American Bar Association rated Professor Barrett as ``well qualified.''  The Democrats have said that the ABA's ratings are very important to them when considering a nominee, once even calling it the ``gold standard.'' Their votes certainly don't reflect that. I suspect the ratings don't actually matter to them since they have voted against most of the ``well qualified'' nominees this The minority has even requested that I not hold hearings on nominees when the committee hasn't received the ABA ratings for that nominee, as if the ABA--an outside group--can and should dictate the committee's schedule. But even when we have ``well qualified'' or ``qualified'' ratings from the ABA, the minority still votes against these nominees, so the actual significance of the rating to the minority doesn't make a lot of sense.  Furthermore, lack of appellate experience hasn't mattered before. When President Clinton nominated Justice Kagan to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, she had no appellate experience. But I remember my friend from Vermont saying that the Senate should vote on her nomination because she was an ``outstanding woman.'' Her lack of appellate experience didn't appear to be of concern to my friends in the minority at the time of Kagan's nomination coming before the committee, so I don't understand why the standard is different now.  Another reason some of my colleagues gave when voting against her is that they say she will disregard judicial precedent. Of course, if that is true, that would be a very serious consideration, but looking at all of Professor Barrett's writings and listening to the testimony she gave, not once did she say that circuit or district court judges could disregard precedent. In fact, during her hearing, she told the committee that she understood ``circuit judges to be absolutely bound by the precedent of the Supreme Court'' and that ``circuit courts are bound to follow the precedent of their own circuit.'' That doesn't sound like a nominee who will not respect precedent. In fact, she understands exactly the role of precedent and the limitations and restrictions placed on lower court judges.  Another Senator argued that she has written provocative things like ``A judge will often entertain an ideological bias that makes him lean one way or the other. In fact, we might safely say that every judge has such an inclination.'' I am not sure why this statement is provocative. I think everyone here knows that every person has their own biases and policy preferences, whether or not they are a judge. In writing this, Professor Barrett shows the awareness to recognize that every person comes to their job with personal biasses and views. This is especially important for judges to recognize about themselves. In fact, she is so self-aware that this is a potential problem for judges that she cowrote an article arguing that if a judge cannot set aside a personal preference in a particular matter before that judge, she shouldn't hear the case in the first place.  These comments come from an article about potential issues Catholic judges may face that Professor Barrett wrote in law school. The article was about Catholic judges but could have been written about the biasses of judges of any religion or of no religion at all. My friends in the minority have looked at a few of her comments from this article and seem to have concluded that she will base her judicial decisions off of what her religion teaches.  During her hearing, one Senator even implied that Professor Barrett could not separate her religion from her judicial decision making, but Professor Barrett had said and argued quite the opposite and had done it several times. She believes that it is highly inappropriate for a judge to use his own religious beliefs in legal reasoning. In fact, she concludes the very article the Democrats are concerned with this way: ``Judges cannot--nor should they try to--align our legal system with the church's moral teachings whenever the two diverge.''  I think opposition to her nomination ultimately comes down to the fact that her personal views about abortion do not line up with the minority's views about abortion. I knew the minority would ask her about her views on abortion, so during her nomination hearing, I took advantage of being the first to ask her if she would allow her religious views to dictate her legal decisions. She said that she would not. I also asked her if she would follow Supreme Court precedent involving abortion, and she simply and succinctly answered: ``Absolutely, I would.''  At her hearing, the statement was made--now, can you believe this?--``You are controversial because many of us that have lived our lives as women really recognize the value of finally being able to control our reproductive systems.''  This statement alone is stunning to me for two reasons--first, that a nominee is controversial because she might share the views of over half the country, which is that abortion is wrong; second, that this statement amounts to a religious test. In response, Professor Barrett said over and over that she has no power to overrule Roe or any other abortion-related Supreme Court case nor does she have interest in challenging that specific precedent.  A further statement was made:       [R]eligion . . . has its own dogma. The law is totally      different. And I think in your case, professor, when you read      your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma      lives loudly within you, and that's of concern when you come      to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for      years in this country.  So the Democrats are saying that women who have personal beliefs that are consistent with their religions are not eligible to be Federal judges even[[Page S6901]]when they have assured the committee, as she did over and over again, that they strongly believe in following binding Supreme Court precedent. If that is the case--if the minority is enforcing a religious litmus test on our nominees--this is an unfortunate day for the Senate and for the country.  Others have spoken on the issue of a religious test, but I will remind my colleagues that the Constitution specifically provides that ``no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office under the United States.'' It is one of the most important founding principles. I do not think an evaluation of how religious a person is or how religious she might not be should ever be a part of that evaluation.  We have received many letters on this topic, including one from Princeton University's president, who is a former law clerk to Justice Stevens and happens to be a constitutional scholar. He writes that the questions the Democrats posed to Professor Barrett about her faith were ``not consistent with the principle set forth in the Constitution's `no religious test' clause'' and that the views expressed in her law review article on Catholic judges are ``fully consistent with a judge's obligation to uphold the law and the Constitution.''  Finally, this morning, my friend from Illinois justified the Democrats' questions to Professor Barrett in committee by noting that I also asked questions in the committee about her article, but there is a difference in simply asking a nominee if her religious views will influence her judicial decision making and trying to ascertain just how religious a nominee is by asking, ``Do you consider yourself an orthodox Catholic?'' or by saying, ``The dogma lives within you.''  My questions gave Professor Barrett a chance to explain her law review article, which was an article I knew the Democrats would question her over. The other side's questions and comments went to figure out just how strongly she would hold to her faith, which was the inappropriate line of questioning.  I will make one more related comment. I mentioned this in the Judiciary Committee, but I think that it bears repeating on the floor because the issue will continue to come up.  Professor Barrett and a few other nominees have a relationship with or ties to the Alliance Defending Freedom group, which, as several Senators have recently pointed out, has been labeled as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law When the nominees have been asked about this, they have pointed out that the Southern Poverty Law Center's designation is, in itself, highly controversial. I would say that it is completely unfounded. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom, is an advocacy organization that litigates religious liberty cases. It has won six cases in front of the Supreme Court in the past 6 years, including cases that are related to free speech and children's playgrounds. They are not outside the mainstream.  Any difference in viewpoint that folks may have with them boils down to, simply, policy differences, but dissent and a difference of opinion do not equal hate, and it is wrong to compare an organization like the ADF to that of the Ku Klux Klan or the Nazi Party and, by extension, imply that the nominees before us sympathize with such actual hate groups.  Finally, I would note that the Southern Poverty Law Center designates the American College of Pediatricians and the Jewish Defense League as hate groups. So some of the Southern Poverty Law Center's designations appear to be discriminatory in and of themselves.  Professor Barrett is a very accomplished, impressive nominee, and we know that her personal story is compelling. She has seven children, several who were adopted from Haiti and one who has special needs. She is an accomplished attorney and a well-respected law professor. I will be strongly supporting her nomination today, and I urge every one of my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.

964,topic-id,1503,"Mr.President, last month the Environmental Protection Agency--EPA--Administrator, Scott Pruitt, issued a directive to all Agency employees that prohibits the so-called sue-and-settle process. This is good news for good government.  Most of us here are familiar with the term ``sue and settle.''  These are tactics whereby the EPA has, in the past, resolved certain lawsuits against it through agreements negotiated behind closed doors with politically favored interest groups. As we saw under the Obama administration, some of these agreements committed the EPA to take far-reaching regulatory action, all without an adequate opportunity for those people most impacted to have a seat at the table, as would normally be done through the regulatory process.  Today, I come to the floor to applaud Administrator Pruitt's leadership in working to end these tactics, which make a mockery of laws that Congress has put in place to ensure a transparent and accountable regulatory process. The commonsense reforms outlined in Administrator Pruitt's directive will, no doubt, help restore transparency and accountability, and these reforms should stand as a prime example for all Federal agencies to follow.  Accordingly, I call upon President Trump to use his full authority through Executive order to ensure that similar reforms are adopted across the entire bureaucracy. Regulatory decisions that affect key parts of our economy should be made in an open, transparent, and, consequently, accountable manner. But as we have seen with sue and settle, Washington bureaucrats and their interest group pals would prefer to do things their own way.  It works like this. First, an interest group sues a Federal agency, claiming the agency has failed to take regulatory action required by law. Through the lawsuit, the interest group seeks to compel the agency to take action by a new, often rushed, deadline. These plaintiff interest groups often share a common regulatory agenda with the agency they sue, such as when an environmental group sues the EPA or the Fish and Wildlife  Instead of challenging the lawsuit, the agency and the interest group enter into negotiations behind closed doors to produce either a ``settlement agreement'' or a ``consent decree'' committing the agency to take regulatory action. There is no transparency, no accountability, which you would get through normal regulation writing.  Noticeably absent from these negotiations are the very parties who will be most impacted, such as farmers, manufacturers, and even the 50 States themselves, which will be charged with enforcing some of these regulations. In 2010, for example, an environmental interest group sued the Obama administration EPA to force the agency to revise certain wastewater regulations.  Wouldn't it be nice to have the people who are affected by those regulations involved in the process in an open way--the way the Administrative Procedure Act is designed?  Oddly enough, the same day the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff interest group submitted a consent decree already signed by the EPA, which committed the agency to take prompt regulatory action. Such a scenario should raise serious questions about how truly adversarial these lawsuits and negotiations are.  To add insult to injury, regulations that have resulted from sue-and-settle tactics impose tremendous costs on the American economy. According to the American Action Forum, from 2005 to 2016, 23 sue-and-settle regulations resulted in a cost burden of $67.9 billion, with $26.5 billion in actual costs. Sixteen of the rules imposed paperwork burdens on American job creators of more than 8 million hours. Think about that. Nearly $70 billion in regulatory costs were imposed on American business owners, manufacturers, farmers, and probably taxpayers, all without due regard for transparency and the normal rulemaking process required by the Administrative Procedure  Decades ago, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act for the sole purpose of ensuring transparency, accountability, and, more importantly, public participation in Federal rulemaking. The EPA has been described as the citizens' ``regulatory bill of rights.'' A pillar of the Administrative Procedure Act is the notice-and-comment process, which requires agencies to notify the public of proposed regulations and respond to comments submitted--in other words, transparency.  Rulemaking driven by sue-and-settle tactics frequently results in reprioritized agency agendas and rushed deadlines for regulatory action. This renders the EPA's notice-and-comment process a mere formality. It deprives regulated entities, it deprives the States, and most importantly, it deprives the American public of sufficient time to have any meaningful input on final rules. The resulting regulatory action is driven not by the public interest but by the special interest priorities.  Sue-and-settle tactics also help agencies avoid accountability for their actions. Instead of having to answer to the public for controversial regulatory decisions, agency officials will simply point to a court order and say that their hands are tied, when really they welcomed that process.  The American people deserve better, but don't just take my word for it. The Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit, nonpartisan association of State and territorial environmental agency leaders, adopted a resolution in 2013 entitled ``The Need for Reform and State Participation in EPA's Consent Decrees which Settle Citizen Suits.'' The rationale behind it[[Page S6964]]provides that ``state environmental agencies are not always notified of citizen suits that allege U.EPA's failure to perform its nondiscretionary duties, are often not parties to these citizen suits, and are usually not provided with an opportunity to participate in the negotiation of agreements to settle citizen suits.''  The Environmental Council of the States further resolved that ``greater transparency of citizen suit settlement agreements is needed for the public to understand the impact of these agreements on the administration of environmental programs.''  Obviously, I agree. We need more transparency, more accountability, and more voices at the table. In other words, the public's business ought to be public, not some new regulation agreed to behind closed doors. I am happy to say that this administration is working to accomplish that, thanks to Administrator In his own words: ``The days of this regulation through litigation . . . are terminated.''  His directive puts a swift end to sue-and-settle tactics by this one agency, the It does so by adopting commonsense reforms to promote transparency and public participation in the regulatory process. It requires the publication online of notices of lawsuits filed against the It requires the EPA to reach out and notify any States or regulated entities that will be affected by the lawsuit. It requires the EPA to seek the agreement of any affected State or regulatory entities before the agency can enter into a consent decree or settlement agreement. Further, it prohibits the EPA from entering into any consent decree or settlement that converts a discretionary duty of the agency into a mandatory duty to issue, revise, or amend a regulation. Most importantly, it requires the EPA to post online for public comment any proposed consent decrees or settlement agreements before they are entered into by the court.  These and other reforms in Administrator Pruitt's directive mark a very strong step toward ensuring that States, American job creators, and the public at large have a seat at the table when regulatory decisions are made, which is exactly why Congress passed the Administrative Procedure  Before I close, I will add one more thing. Earlier this year, I introduced the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements This bill would make permanent the very types of reforms outlined in Administrator Pruitt's directive. If it becomes law, it can't be changed at some later date. In other words, it would ensure that future administrations can't simply roll back the great work Administrator Pruitt is doing through this directive.  I am pleased to hear that the House of Representatives just passed the companion bill introduced by Congressman Doug We will continue our work to build bipartisan support here in the Senate for this commonsense decree.  But, today, I urge President Trump to move forward with the example set by Administrator Pruitt because Administrator Pruitt is draining the swamp through this process. The President loves to sign Executive orders. He would probably do more good in draining the swamp by producing an Executive order like this than almost any other Executive order he could do.  There is simply no reason these reforms should be limited to just the Transparency and public participation are core elements of a more accountable government. Simply stated, they are part of the process of representative government, where people make the laws and where administrators carry out the laws, not where something is done behind closed doors because some special interest wants something or because the agency is begging to do something--which maybe someone doesn't want them to do--to get it done and to do it behind closed doors, just to work it out the way they want it and not necessarily the way it would be done if people were participating.  I applaud Administrator Pruitt's directive. I urge the President to promptly see to it that similar reforms are implemented across the administration.  So for a third time today, President Trump, issue an Executive order to all departments to do what Administrator Pruitt has done at the                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6963-2.txt,457,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3922, COMMUNITY HEALTH AND MEDICAL",2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

982,topic-id,1222,"Mr.President, we are about to vote on our fourth circuit court nominee this week, and I am glad to speak in support of the nomination of Professor Bibas to serve on the Third Circuit Court of That court sits in Professor Bibas is a highly qualified nominee. His background as a well-regarded legal scholar and Supreme Court advocate will serve him well as a judge on that circuit.  Additionally, Professor Bibas received a rare, unanimously ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar My Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have expressed to me that the ABA's ratings are very important to their evaluation of nominees. Yet all of the Democratic members of the committee voted against Professor Bibas in the committee, despite his having received the highest rating possible. This is consistent with their votes against Professor Amy Barrett, Justice Joan Larsen and Justice Allison Eid, all of whom received ``well qualified'' ratings. It appears that my Democratic colleagues don't actually treat the ABA's ratings as particularly important when it comes right down to practice.  Professor Bibas is the son of a Greek immigrant who came to this country after surviving the Nazi occupation of He boasts impressive academic credentials. He graduated from Columbia University at the age of 19. He then received degrees from the University of Oxford and Yale Law After law school, Professor Bibas clerked for Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and then for Justice Anthony Kennedy of the U.Supreme  Following these prestigious clerkships, Professor Bibas became an assistant U.attorney in the Southern District of New His experience as a prosecutor gave him a firsthand view of the problems and injustices in the American criminal justice system. He decided to pursue a career as an academic, focusing then on improving the criminal justice system for all involved.  Professor Bibas's first stint as a professor was in my home State of Iowa at the University of Iowa College of He taught criminal law and procedure there for 5 years. We were certainly lucky to have a professor of his caliber. Professor Bibas then took a position on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he has been teaching since.[[Page S6988]]  Professor Bibas has been prolific in his academic writings, publishing numerous articles on all aspects of criminal law. His academic work culminated in the publication of his book entitled ``The Machinery of Criminal Justice.'' That book was published in 2012. In this book and in many of his articles, Professor Bibas criticized the current model of bureaucratic ``assembly line'' justice and America's high incarceration rate. Much of his work is devoted to finding solutions to these problems. His academic work has certainly had an impact on the law. In fact, Professor Bibas is one of the most cited law professors in judicial opinions. One study shows that he is the 15th most cited legal scholar by total judicial opinions, and he is the fifth most cited in the area of criminal law--not bad for a relatively young professor.  Professor Bibas has also had a positive impact on colleagues and students. The Judiciary Committee received a letter from 121 law professors throughout our country representing a diverse range of viewpoints. These professors support Professor Bibas's nomination, pointing to his--and this quote comes from the letter--``influential contributions to criminal law and procedure scholarship,'' as well as his ``fair-mindedness, conscientiousness, and personal integrity.''  Professor Bibas also received a letter in support of his nomination from many colleagues at the University of They stated that he has been ``an outstanding scholar, teacher, and colleague'' at  Professor Bibas also has extensive litigation experience. He is currently the director of the University of Pennsylvania Law School's Supreme Court In this role, he and his students have represented numerous litigants who could not otherwise afford top-flight counsel. He has argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court, and he obtained a significant victory in the landmark case of Padilla v. Kentucky, which established a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to accurate information about deportation before pleading guilty.  One of our Supreme Court Justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a personal letter to Professor Bibas that the Judiciary Committee received, called him one of the ``very best lawyers presenting cases to the Court.'' It is kind of nice, if you are considered kind of a strict constructionist, that you get a letter like that from one of the more activist members of the Supreme  Some of my Democratic colleagues criticize Professor Bibas during his confirmation hearing for two really isolated events in the long and illustrious career he has had.  First, Democrats criticized Professor Bibas for prosecuting a minor theft of only $7 when he was an assistant U.attorney. This case took place nearly 20 years ago. But it was Professor Bibas's supervisor who made the decision to charge the defendant and, of course, required an underling by the name of Bibas to pursue the case even after it started to fall apart.  In his hearing, Professor Bibas readily acknowledged that the defendant should not have been prosecuted, and the professor stated this to our committee:       I learned from that mistake, and as a scholar, I have      dedicated my career to trying to diagnose and prevent the      causes of such errors in the future--inadequate Brady      disclosure, new prosecutor syndrome, tunnel vision, jumping      to conclusions, partisan mindsets. And I have testified      before this committee on those very issues. And so I made a      mistake. I apologized. I learned from it, and I have tried to      improve the justice system going forward.''  Some of my colleagues have also criticized Professor Bibas for a single article that he wrote but never published. This article endorsed limited forms of corporal punishment as an alternative to lengthy prison sentences. But Professor Bibas reconsidered this idea soon after completing the article. He concluded that it was a bad idea and did not publish it. He completely disavowed the position in his book published shortly thereafter.  When asked about corporal punishment at his hearing, Professor Bibas stated:       It is wrong. It is not It is not something I      advocate. I categorically reject it.  Additionally, Professor Bibas's position on corporal punishment was well-intended. He was motivated to address overly harsh and unproductively long prison sentences. As he said at his hearing, he wanted to offer an answer to the question, ``Is there some way, any way, we can avoid the hugely destructive effect [of imprisonment] both on prisoners' own lives and on the families, the friends, the communities?''  In the time since Professor Bibas wrote the article, he has offered more creative solutions to the disruptions caused by lengthy prison sentences. As an example, instead of suffering through forced indolence, prisoners could work and develop work-related skills in anticipation of their release from prison.  Professor Bibas's scholarship, as I have stated and quoted from, is a testimony to his devotion to the rule of law and the notion of equal justice before the law. It is very clear that he cares very deeply about how the criminal justice system impacts defendants, victims, families, and entire communities. As you can tell, I am very confident that Professor Bibas will make an excellent judge on the Third Circuit Court of  I yield the floor.

733,topic-id,707,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition to H.2936, the so-called Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. Perhaps a better name would be the ``Log America's Forest Act of 2017.''  But before I address the many concerns with the underlying bill, I must commend my colleagues across the aisle for attempting to deal with the biggest barrier to improved management of our national forests: the enormous cost and impact of wildfire suppression on the Forest Service budget.  Over 50 percent of the Forest Service budget is eaten up by wildfire, and if things don't change, the agency predicts that it will increase to two-thirds in just 5 years. Unfortunately, the budget fix in this bill falls short.  First, it requires Congress to appropriate an amount equal to the 10-year average before emergency funding is available. We know that climate change results in longer and more intense wildfire seasons, making the 10-year average irrelevant to the ever-increasing need for funding. Because the average is too low, the real number will keep growing, meaning the amount of funding that must be taken from the Forest Service accounts will continue to grow. Fighting fires will continue squeezing out money for the active management my Republican colleagues are so eager to prioritize.  Second, requiring the President to declare each fire a national emergency before releasing funds is unnecessarily bureaucratic and could delay emergency operations.  We need a holistic fix for the wildfire budget that makes money available in advance of a critical emergency, but Republicans would rather play politics with fire to undermine environmental safeguards.  This is not the first time we have seen the bill, this piece of legislation. House Republicans sent a version to the Senate in the 113th and the 114th Congresses, where it languished on the shelf because our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol found it too extreme.  Rather than view that experience as an opportunity to seek compromise this time around, today we are considering a bill that is even more extreme and polarizing. They doubled the environmental review waivers, added language to undermine the Endangered Species Act, and scaled back protections for national monuments and roadless areas.  We are told that this is all in the name of decreasing wildfire risk and protecting communities. The truth is that it is just more of the same from House Republicans who will look for any excuse to advance their extraction-above-all agenda.  Wildfires are a huge problem in this country due, in large part, to climate change, something this bill ignores. By the way, they are becoming more frequent and more intense, and they pose a growing threat to public safety and local communities.  This bill is not about forest health or wildfire mitigation. It is about increasing the number of trees removed from our forests. Republicans would rather scare us into weakening environmental safeguards than work on a possible bipartisan solution to wildfire management.[[Page H8334]]  A serious proposal would recognize the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior have ample authority within current law to conduct fire treatment on our public lands. In fact, the 2009 Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, established the last time Democrats controlled the House, has resulted in the treatment of over 1.45 million acres of national forests to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire and the improvement of over 1.33 million acres of wildlife habitat.  In just 5 years, the program generated more than $661 million in local labor income and an average of 4,300 jobs per year. The projects have attracted new partners and strengthened community relationships, leveraging over $76.1 million in partner matching funds. Collaborative programs like this bring people to the table and result in more acres treated, more local jobs, and more successful projects. Again, all of this has taken place within the framework of the current law.  Increased funding for programs like Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration should be a priority for Republicans, but this program was zeroed out by the Trump administration budget, and extreme proposals like this bill chip away at the principal pillars of law that make collaboration possible. Our constituents and our forests deserve better.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

736,topic-id,363,"Mr.Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.DeFazio).  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I remember, 13 years ago, after another spate of catastrophic fires in the Western United States, we came together in a truly bipartisan fashion and passed something called the Healthy Forests Restoration It authorized up to 20 million acres to be treated to remove[[Page H8336]]hazard fuels in what is called the WUI, the wildland-urban interface, and in threats to municipal water supplies. We also authorized $760 million a year.  Well, it has been 13 years. We authorized 20 million acres of work. What has been done? 2\1/2\ million.  Is it because of litigation, lawsuits, or, you know, obstruction? It is because of this body, the United States Congress, which is refusing to put up the money to do the work.  In my State alone, there are 1.8 million acres waiting for treatment. They have gone through all environmental reviews. There is no potential for litigation or any other blocking, but they don't have the money.  Does this bill fix that? We are addressing problems that don't exist in terms of addressing the wildfire problem.  This is really, you know, kind of a lost opportunity, a missed opportunity. Yes, it does a partial fix of the wildfire borrowing, which devastates the Forest Service every year. I appreciate that. But the fact is, we have got 44 million homes that are now at risk in terms of wildland-urban interface, and we have only treated 2\1/2\ million acres because this Congress isn't putting up the money.                              {time}  1600  And this year, yet again, they are proposing like one-half of what we authorized. What does one-half get you? It gets you half the acreage.  So if we had appropriated at the levels we authorized over the last 13 years, they would have treated 5 or 6 million acres. Again, they weren't blocked by litigation. They weren't blocked by appeals. The HFRA Act became virtually noncontroversial because it didn't do away with judicial review, which this bill will do on a certain number of projects in each region every year.  I wish that this was a bipartisan approach, it isn't, and I cannot support the legislation.

737,topic-id,344,"Mr.Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.McEachin).  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, the goal of forest management should be to make our forests more resilient--more resilient to the impacts of climate change, drought, and wildlife--but contrary to its title, H.2936, the so-called Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, does not achieve these goals.  This bill includes exemptions from analyses required under the National Environmental Policy Act, restricts judicial review of certain forest management activities, amends the Equal Access to Justice Act to limit payment of attorneys' fees, and scales back the wildlife conservation efforts of the Endangered Species  Mr.Chairman, this bill desperately needs improvement, and I am disappointed that my commonsense amendment--offered both in committee and again to Rules, this time with my colleague, Mr.Beyer from Virginia--is not being considered by the  My amendment would have struck two sections of this bill that are designed to allow approval of timber projects without adequate consideration of the impacts to some of the most vulnerable living creatures on Earth: those listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species  The first offending section would put the U.Fish and Wildlife Service on a 90-day shot clock to complete consultations required under section 7 of the Such a provision is both unnecessary and deeply harmful.  The second section my amendment would have struck is designed to prevent ESA consultation from happening altogether when FWS lists a new species or designates critical habitat for a listed species. This simply defies logic.  Getting ESA consultation right--and ensuring that it happens in the first place--is a small price to pay for preserving irreplaceable parts of our natural heritage.  Mr.Chairman, H.2936 attacks responsible forest management policy and promotes commercial logging at the expense of sound environmental review.  Instead of giving gifts to special interests, Congress should be addressing the effects of climate change, working to reduce the risk of wildfire, and fixing the wildfire budget.  Mr.Chairman, this bill takes us many steps in the wrong direction, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

743,topic-id,349,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As we have talked about H.2936, this is something that has been before two previous Congresses and went nowhere; and as a consequence, we continue to not confront the issue of appropriate and necessary funding for the Forest Service to conduct wildfire suppression. That is the gap in this. This flawed attempt to try to fix the funding issue does not.  In fact, Congress has provided appropriate tools to conduct restoration, reduce hazardous fuels, and restore ecological balance on national forest and public lands.  Congress should fix the wildfire budget--that is the issue--not use this as leverage to subsidize the timber industry and also overturn essential environmental laws.  This legislation has an attack on NEPA, has an attack on the Endangered Species Act, has an attack on judicial review and access to justice, has an attack on the Antiquities Act, and continues the process of fire borrowing.  H.2936 is not about forest health or reducing wildfire risk. It is intended to make it easier to advance commercial logging and sales on our national forests and public lands.  A flawed attempt to fix the wildfire funding problem, it does nothing to change the anti-environmental provisions in the underlying bill.  We have a serious issue, validated because of all the studies that have been done, including GAO, which found that climate change is a contributor, scientists have found that climate change is a contributor. That is not discussed because that is a hoax, my Republican colleagues say, created by the So we will not talk about climate change as a major factor, which it is, to the increasing intensity and length of wildfires across our public lands and across private and State lands as well.  This legislation is about undermining environmental law. It does nothing about the funding necessary to fight wildfires in this country. It does nothing about involving the stakeholders in proactive restoration and reducing the threat of wildfire in this country.  Mr.Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.2936, and I yield back the balance of my time.

765,topic-id,236,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment doubles down on the bad ideas that are in the underlying bill. The 150,000 acre categorical exclusion to remove timber from Gila, Lincoln, and Cibola National Forests has the potential to do more harm than good, and cuts the American public out of the decisionmaking process.  The Forest Service doesn't need this waiver to harvest trees in New Last year, the Cibola produced 12,000 metric board feet, and Lincoln and Gila each between 5,000 and 6,000 metric board feet. These are average production numbers across the region.  So I am not sure what problem this amendment is trying to address or how exempting 150,000-acre projects from the environmental review helps the Forest Service meet their mandate of protecting habitat, watersheds, and providing recreational opportunities.  This amendment also exempts the Forest Service from the consultation requirements and the Endangered Species Logging projects untethered from the bedrock environmental protections could potentially impact several species which depend on these forests for habitat, including the Mexican spotted owl and the Gila trout.  Active forest management is not a bad thing if it is done responsibly. If NEPA and the Endangered Species Act are followed, we get good projects, safe habitat restoration--not clear-cutting and loss of critical habitat. Unfortunately, this amendment undermines both of these fundamental laws and should be rejected.  Mr.Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

767,topic-id,1775,"Mr.Chair, this amendment would not resolve the issue that my friend from New Mexico has just brought up. The Statement of Administrative Policy from the executive branch raises the concerns of H.2936 and of the land management reforms, which are in the legislation.  It says: ``The administration, however, has concerns about the legislation's revision to the Stafford Act, which would force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, including hurricanes.''  It also says that the legislation doesn't really address the issue of fire borrowing, which is central to dealing effectively and proactively with wildfires, both prevention, and suppression, as the resource is needed.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record the Statement of Administrative Policy by the Trump administration. I also include another Statement of Administrative Policy dated July 8, 2015, which is on the same legislation, but by then-President Obama, which mirrors and reflects the same concerns brought up by the executive branch of President                   Statement of Administration Policyh.r. 293--resilient federal forests act of 2017--rep. westerman, r-ar,                            and 18 cosponsors       The Administration strongly believes that funding for      wildland fire management must be addressed in order to enable      the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to      better manage the Nation's forests and other public lands.      The Administration's second disaster funding request,      submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this      belief. The request also noted the Administration's belief      that land management reforms are critical to solving the      problem of ``fire borrowing''--taking funds from forest      management programs to cover fire costs that exceed      appropriations--in a comprehensive manner, rather than      through a funding-only approach.       The Administration appreciates the intent of H.2936, the      Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and is supportive of      land management reforms like those outlined in the      legislation. The Administration, however, has concerns about      the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would      force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal      land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act,      including hurricanes.     Wildland Fire Management Funding       Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached      $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for      Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression      operations. The dependence on ``fire borrowing'' to cover      funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the      missions of our land management agencies, including by taking      critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of      catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning      ecosystems, and yield timber production.       The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing      the Stafford Act to address wildfires. The purpose of the      Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and      territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when      responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting      their jurisdictions. H.2936 would modify the Stafford Act      by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the      cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby      changing long-standing principles governing Federal support      to SLTT governments. As we have seen in this year's historic      Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management      Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing      mission, and the Stafford Act's Disaster Relief Fund must      remain dedicated solely to that mission.       Instead of the approach outlined in H.2936, the      Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for      wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns      about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and      avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.     Improving Forest Management       The Administration appreciates H.2936's recognition that      fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on      its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires.      Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our      ability to restore the Nation's forests and improve their      resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part[[Page H8356]]     of any permanent solution. H.2936's provisions that      expedite environmental approval for proactive forest      management, including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire      timber salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps      forward. The Administration supports and will continue to      work with Congress on the details of the forest management      reform proposals.       Although the Administration has concerns with H.2936's      modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will      continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable      solution to ``fire borrowing'' that does not adversely affect      FEMA's critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes      the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of      wildfires.                                  ____                   Statement of Administration Policyh.r. 2647--resilient federal forests act of 2015--rep. westerman, r-ar,                            and 13 cosponsors       The Administration strongly opposes H.2647. The most      important step Congress can take to increase the pace and      scale of forest restoration and management of the national      forests and Department of the Interior (DOI) lands is to fix      fire suppression funding and provide additional capacity for      the Forest Service and DOI to manage the Nation's forests and      other public lands. H.2647 falls short of fixing the fire      budget problem and contains other provisions that will      undermine collaborative forest restoration, environmental      safeguards, and public participation across the National      Forest System and public lands.     Wildland Fire Management Funding       The Administration appreciates that there is bipartisan      agreement that wildland fire management funding needs a      legislative fix. The reasons are clear: in fiscal year (FY)      1995, the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture      (USDA) spent 16 percent of its budget on firefighting. Today      the agency spends more than half of its budget on fire      management activities. This fundamentally impedes its      missions, including taking critical funding from programs      that help reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, maintain      healthy functioning ecosystems, and yield timber production.       The wildland fire funding fix in the President's FY 2016      Budget provides the necessary resources for the Forest      Service as well as DOI to address wildland fire suppression      and rehabilitation needs without resorting to detrimental      transfers from other critical forest landscape resilience      priorities. Under this fix, which includes a discretionary      budget cap adjustment, the Forest Service and DOI could tap      disaster funds once they spend 70 percent of their 10-year      average of suppression spending, which is the amount of      suppression funding requested within the discretionary budget      caps. Providing this certainty would preserve critical      resources for hazardous fuel reduction and other essential      landscape restoration projects, allowing for more acres to be      treated, and thereby reducing the risk of fire, and the      degree of fire destruction.       The Administration's proposal would immediately increase      the Forest Service's capacity to plan and execute restoration      projects--including the FY 2016 Budget projection for timber      volume sold from 2.9 billion board feet in FY 2014 to 3.2      billion board feet.       In contrast, the requirement in H.2647 to fully fund the      ten-year average for wildland fire suppression would mean      that less funding is available each year in the agencies'      budgets for restoration and risk reduction programs as it is      diverted to the ever-increasing ten-year average.       Additionally, the bill repurposes the Stafford The      purpose of the Stafford Act is to provide Federal assistance      to State, local, and tribal governments to alleviate disaster      suffering and facilitate recovery. This bill would instead      establish a sub-account within the Department of Homeland      Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster      Relief Fund (DRF) to provide funding for USDA and DOI to      perform wildland fire suppression operations on Federal land      when suppression funding is exhausted and the President has      issued a disaster declaration for such fires. A proposed sub-     account under the DRF should not be used to redirect DRF      resources in support of non-Stafford responsibilities or to      circumvent existing major disaster declarations processes.     Undermining Fundamental Environmental Safeguards       The Administration takes seriously the management of      Federal lands consistent with the principles of multiple-use      and sustained-yield that are fundamental to the National      Forest Management Act and the Federal Land Management and      Policy Act and in accordance with long-standing environmental      laws including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),      the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, among      others. Application of these environmental laws ensures that      management activities recognize the economic benefits of      Federal lands and the wide range of goods and services that      these lands produce.       At the President's direction, Federal agencies, like the      Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, are working      diligently to promote efficiencies in the permitting and land      management process. For example, the Forest Service has      established additional categorical exclusions for restoration      work, has expanded the use of focused environmental      assessments, is using adaptive management to allow decisions      to last longer, and is better training employees to take      advantage of new efficiencies. The Forest Service is also      developing new approaches in the wake of catastrophic fires,      such as the response to the Rim Fire, which burned 257,000      acres in the summer of 2013, in which the Stanislaus National      Forest finalized its NEPA work for restoration and salvage in      one year. The Forest Service is also developing projects      across larger areas, thereby utilizing efficiencies and      providing a longer term and more certain timber supply for      local mills. For example, the Black Hills National Forest is      implementing a landscape scale approach across 200,000 acres      for treating current and future pine beetle outbreaks.       H.2647 includes several provisions that will undermine      collaborative, landscape-scale forest restoration by      undermining public trust in forest management projects and by      limiting public participation in decision-making. The      Administration has substantial concerns with the design and      scale of the categorical exclusions, provisions related to      post-fire salvage and restoration (including unrealistic      timelines for environmental assessments), and unrealistic      targets for reforestation given current budgetary resources.       The Administration has serious concerns with provisions in      the bill related to the Resources Advisory Committees (RACs).      The Administration opposes provisions that limit the      discretion of RACs by requiring 50 percent of Secure Rural      Schools Act Title II funding be spent on timber management      projects. H.2647 also assumes RACs can fulfill the role of      local forest collaboratives in designing forest restoration      projects, though the RACs were not specially set up to do      this and in many cases may not have the breadth of      stakeholder interest and expertise to do so effectively.      Additionally, the Administration opposes restrictions in the      bill on the membership of       Furthermore, the Administration opposes provisions in the      bill that require litigants to post a bond when challenging      forest restoration projects. As the Forest Service has      demonstrated, the best way to address concerns about      litigation is to develop restoration projects in partnership      with broad stakeholder interests through a transparent      process informed by the best available science. Lastly, the      bill should include stronger protections for ecologically      sensitive areas, tribal sacred sites, and other important      lands.       For the reasons set forth above, the Administration      strongly opposes H.2647. The Administration looks forward      to continued engagement with Congress to address forest      management issues, which must begin by providing the Forest      Service and DOI with a comprehensive fix to the fire budget      problem.

698,topic-id,520,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, one, this IPAB effort is bipartisan. We have even heard on the floor both sides of the aisle support passage of the bill. It has been bipartisan.  First, a couple of things. On the value-based payments--which I think is the direction we need to go to rein in the costs and make sure we have sustainable programs, but the IPAB's annual short-term focus savings provision would affect Medicare and the wider health system in unpredictable ways with potentially many negative unintended consequences by doubling down on the traditional practice of squeezing payment rates in order to slow spending with no meaningful eye to how these changes impact long-term incentives--the IPAB could work at cross purposes to broaden reform that would base Medicare payments on quality and value.  On the offset, we did offset CHIP and the community health centers. We know that money is going to be spent. We know that when we authorize it, it is going to be spent. We believe it is going to be spent wisely. That is why we are moving forward with these bills.  The IPAB has not been constituted, and repealing it should not have to be offset since it has not spent any money nor been charged yet with finding any savings. The IPAB trigger has never been hit. The CBO estimates that the IPAB would be triggered in 2023, 2025, and 2027. But by their own admission, and I quote from the report, ``Given the uncertainty that surrounds these projections, it is possible such authority would be invoked in other years,'' or we could also assume possibly never at all.  The CBO estimate also has to assume the level of cuts required by the amount Medicare is spending that exceeds the trigger. The CBO also then has to speculate on how reductions made in any one year would impact the trigger in future years, further laying assumption upon guesswork. As the CBO notes in their estimate, the estimate represents a broad range of possible effects.  The CBO admits they do not know if the IPAB will be triggered or what policies they might pursue if activated. Some of their assumptions are one-sided bets that may or may not achieve savings, and the CBO must further speculate on the probabilities associated with such variations.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I believe the IPAB will not be effective providing real solutions for Medicare solvency. It contributes disproportionately little to the projected cost savings needed in Medicare, but it has the potential to hurt seniors' access to care. Fundamentally, I believe it is a constitutional affront to the legislative branch.                              {time}  1645  The IPAB decisions don't come to Congress to be approved or disapproved. We can undo the IPAB decisions if we have dollar-for-dollar replacement, but that could even be blocked by a minority vote in the  So I urge my colleagues to support H.849, to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, and I hope there will continue to be bipartisan support for this important legislation.

Healthcare  Mr.President, I also rise today to encourage Granite Staters--as my colleague from Washington did--and people across the country to take advantage of the health insurance open enrollment period, which begins today and runs through December 15.  Every citizen deserves quality, affordable health insurance coverage to help them live healthy and productive lives. Access to healthcare is critical to the freedom, dignity, and well-being of our citizens, and it also contributes to a productive workforce and a thriving economy.  I still remember meeting with a constituent named Jo, about a year or two ago, who has a chronic health condition. When she lost her job in 2009 and lost her health insurance with it, her condition deteriorated to the point where she couldn't work, and a downward spiral ensued. She lost her home. She couldn't get healthcare because she had no resources. Because of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, she was eventually able to get healthcare, to get the surgery and therapy she needed, and now she is working again. So healthcare is not only for the benefit of the individual who receives it; it helps that individual become a productive member of our workforce.  Affordable, quality care is also critically important to those who are working but may not otherwise be able to afford health insurance even if employed. It is something I have heard often this year from citizens of my State, as my Republican colleagues attempted to pass TrumpCare legislation that would have led to higher healthcare costs for less care.  At an emergency field hearing in June that I held with Senator Shaheen, we heard from a woman named Enna from Exeter, Enna, who is self-employed, said that prior to the Affordable Care Act, her family was unable to maintain insurance consistently. Even when she did have it, her previous policy didn't cover critical preventive care that she needed. As a result of the ACA, Enna has been able to purchase affordable health insurance through the marketplace in New Hampshire for herself and her family of four, giving them the peace of mind that comes with having health insurance, while continuing to grow her own business.  Enna's story is the story of so many people in New Hampshire, and it represents why it is essential for people across the country to take advantage of this open enrollment period.  From today through December 15, Granite Staters and all Americans have an opportunity to sign up for a healthcare plan at www.coveringnewhampshire.org or www.healthcare.gov. It is also important for people to take this opportunity to see what other plans are available, to shop around and see whether other plans offer more savings than their current one does, and it is critical to educate our friends and neighbors about these options, given the Trump administration's attempts to sabotage our Nation's healthcare[[Page S6943]]system. These sabotage attempts include the Department of Health and Human Services slashing the Affordable Care Act's outreach and advertising budgets ahead of open enrollment, which provide key information and resources for those who need to sign up for care. It is clear that the Trump administration doesn't want people to know they can enroll, but that doesn't change the fact that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, people can still get covered, and financial assistance is available for many on the healthcare exchange.  We must end this sabotage and continue to work together on efforts to lower costs and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act, and that is exactly what I am focused on.  I was proud to join HELP Committee leaders, Senators Alexander and Murray, to cosponsor bipartisan legislation that would stabilize health insurance markets and lower costs for hard-working This bill includes a provision that the New Hampshire Insurance Department could use to support its proposal to create a reinsurance pool to help reduce premiums in our State's individual health insurance market. This legislation proves it is possible to work across party lines to make progress in our healthcare system. It is clear that it has the votes to pass. We need Republican leadership to bring it up for a vote.  It is up to all of us to come together and make sure that healthcare is truly available and affordable to all of our people and to encourage our fellow citizens to sign up for the care they need to help their families thrive.  The enrollment period is a critical time for the health and well-being of our citizens and for our productivity, as well, as a country. I encourage Granite Staters to take advantage of this opportunity and receive the benefits that come with affordable healthcare.  Mr.President, I also want to take a moment to address the continued efforts this week from President Trump and my Republican colleagues to push through nominees who will truly reshape our Federal judiciary.  An independent and impartial judiciary is critical to democracy and to our march toward progress. Our Founders established our court system to serve as an independent arbiter that would protect the rights of all Americans and ensure equal justice under our laws. Unfortunately, the nominees who have been selected by the President and who have been voted on throughout this year have been handpicked by far-right groups to serve a conservative agenda. We have seen judicial nominees who have not committed to upholding the precedent of Roe v. Wade and protecting a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and control her own destiny in doing so, nominees who have stood against basic rights and freedoms for LGBTQ Americans and who have opposed protections for workers' rights. This is unacceptable.  We are voting on lifetime appointments that require a commitment to equal justice, objectivity, and sound judgment. I will continue to oppose judicial nominees who do not live up to those standards, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

176,topic-id,1173,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, before beginning my remarks, I would offer condolences to the grieving families who lost loved ones in yesterday's terrorist attack in New York City, and to have the people of New York know--and I know I speak for all of us, and there will be a more appropriate recognition at a time in the future, I am sure, but to have them know that all of us grieve with them and are concerned not only for those who lost their lives, but to assist in preventing measures of this type in the future.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington for yielding to me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  This bill is a sweeping attack on responsible forest management policy that upends key environmental safeguards, limits public participation in land management decisions, and prioritizes commercial timber harvest over transparent, science-based management. In other words, this is business as usual for this Republican majority when it comes to protecting our environment.  A footnote right there, my friend from the State of Washington does highlight, rightly, concerns not only for his congressional district, but areas throughout the country that have experienced wildfires.  Many of us have talked about this in conjunction with other disasters and a need for this Congress to be able to address the shortfall in funding for such important measures.  During this Congress alone, my Republican friends have brought to the floor bills that undermine the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue independent and objective scientific conclusions, weaken regulations of pesticides, and repeal rulemakings aimed at effective, science-based management of public lands, just to name a few things.  Repeatedly, my Republican friends ignore science and attack environmental protections all in an all-too-obvious attempt to help commercial interests over sound conservation policy. This focus not only undermines our public lands, but it also harms the health and safety of the American people.  This bill continues the assault on our Nation's environmental protections, and it may be one of the most irresponsible examples yet.  Under the guise of responding to the recent tragic wildfires in California and elsewhere in this Nation, this legislation attacks the National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, which requires Federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their actions.  The bill also attacks the Endangered Species Act by requiring redundant and unnecessary reporting requirements. It blocks access to the courts and limits recovery in environmental justice cases. Just for good measure, this bill effectively overturns President Obama's administration's monument expansion.  The bill does little to fix the true problem of wildfire management, namely the chronic underfunding of wildfire management. Any serious proposal must address the constant funding shortages at the U.Forest Service by increasing the amount of Federal funding available for wildfire suppression. A successful solution needs to provide advanced access to emergency funding.  Unfortunately, today's legislation does no such thing. Yesterday, the administration offered its statement of administration policy, and, at best, it is tepid. It says, ``The administration appreciates the intent of H.2936 . . . and is supportive of land management reforms like those outlined in the legislation,'' and then comes the however. ``The administration, however, has concerns about the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, including hurricanes.''  It goes on to say, `` . . . the administration supports a separate, annual cap[[Page H8311]]adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.''  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration                   Statement Of Administration PolicyH.2936--Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017--Westerman R-AR,                              and cosponsors       The Administration strongly believes that funding for      wildland fire management must be addressed in order to enable      the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to      better manage the Nation's forests and other public lands.      The Administration's second disaster funding request,      submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this      belief. The request also noted the Administration's belief      that land management reforms are critical to solving the      problem of ``fire borrowing''--taking funds from forest      management programs to cover fire costs that exceed      appropriations--in a comprehensive manner, rather than      through a funding-only appropriations approach.       The Administration appreciates the intent of H.2936, the      Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and is supportive of      land management reforms like those outlined in the      legislation. The Administration, however, has concerns about      the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would      force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal      land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act,      including hurricanes.     Wildland Fire Management Funding       Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached      $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for      Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression      operations. The dependence on ``fire borrowing'' to cover      funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the      missions of our land management agencies, including by taking      critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of      catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning      ecosystems, and yield timber production.       The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing      the Stafford Act to address wildfires. The purpose of the      Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and      territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when      responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting      their jurisdictions. H.2936 would modify the Stafford Act      by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the      cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby      changing long-standing principles governing Federal support      to SLTT governments. As we have seen in this year's historic      Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management      Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing      mission, and the Stafford Act's Disaster Relief Fund must      remain dedicated solely to that mission.       Instead of the approach outlined in H.2936, the      Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for      wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns      about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and      avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.     Improving Forest Management       The Administration appreciates H.2936's recognition that      fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on      its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires.      Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our      ability to restore the Nation's forests and improve their      resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part of any      permanent solution. H.2936's provisions that expedite      environmental approval for proactive forest management,      including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire timber      salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps      forward. The Administration supports and will continue to      work with Congress on the details of the forest management      reform proposals.       Although the Administration has concerns with H.2936's      modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will      continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable      solution to ``fire borrowing'' that does not adversely affect      FEMA's critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes      the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of      wildfires.

177,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, as I indicated, the bill does little to fix the true problem of wildfire management. Any serious proposal, as I have said, must address the constant funding shortages, and that is what, among other things, the administration suggested.  Mr.Speaker, this year has been a wake-up call. We must do more to respond to the natural disasters that face our After three major hurricanes and devastating wildfires in my friend from Washington's State, in California, in Montana, and even in the Everglades of Florida we have experienced some wildfires, albeit not at the magnitude of loss of life or property as existed in some of the others, our resources and agencies are stretched to the brink.  Weeks after the storms, millions of people across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are without power and without reliable access to clean drinking water. FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified just yesterday that the response to these storms and wildfires and other disasters--we have had tornadoes that have come along as well--is costing the Federal Government $200 million a day.  Mr.Speaker, I understand that the Office of Management and Budget is currently working to send a proposal to Congress for a third supplemental spending package to address the recovery needs in the affected areas. I urge them and my colleagues here in Congress to act swiftly to provide the resources that so many people desperately need. In the meantime, what have we gotten from Republicans? Bipartisanship? Sound science-based proposals? Instead, the Republican majority has ignored bipartisanship, and, yesterday, in the Rules Committee, a bipartisan measure was offered that was a thoughtful proposal on this topic, and was rejected, and presented this bill that we have here now that doesn't address the real issues facing public land and wildfire management, but, rather, guts environmental protection and overturns President Obama's monument expansion.                              {time}  1245  Mr.Speaker, this is business as usual for House But if we are going to seriously address natural disasters and how we respond to them, I encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle to put aside their partisanship, reconsider their denial of climate change and its effects on our environment, and join Democrats in working together to address this and other important issues faced by all  There were two amendments that were offered yesterday by my colleagues from Both of those amendments were not made in order. I don't think it is right when people offer legislation, particularly those that have just been damaged, as our colleagues, Congressmen Thompson and Matsui, and others in the northern California region. They at least should have had an opportunity to offer up their amendment and have it voted against if people felt so here in this body.  I would hope, in the future, we would make a correction of that kind of undertaking. I would hope all Members of this body would have an opportunity to present their ideas on any legislation, and something as important as this could have allowed for an open rule, rather than for partisan activity to reign supreme.

I have no additional speakers, and I will go forward with your permission.  In the wake of the worst wildfires, as have been mentioned here by so many[[Page H8315]]of our colleagues, that the U.has experienced in quite a while, House Republicans, however, have responded by bringing to the floor, really, a tired bill passed last Congress that went nowhere in the Senate, a bill that does not fix the true problem of chronically underfunding wildfire prevention but, instead, doubles down in creating an unworkable system for wildfire suppression funding, a bill that rolls back environmental protection and limits access to the courts.  It is dismaying to see the response to natural disasters in this country hinge on the same thing so many other important debates do: partisanship and ignoring facts and science.  Despite a year in which we have seen historic hurricanes and wildfires, my Republican colleagues have yet again resorted to continuing to push policies that repeal environmental regulations, all the while denying the effects climate change is having on our communities and our country's economy.  My friend from Oregon, a moment ago--and he is my friend--spoke about the thunderstorms that we receive in In his version, it is accompanied by rain, and that is true a lot. But we, too, have droughts in Florida, and Florida is known as the lightning capital of the world. Very occasionally, particularly in central Florida and in the Everglades, those lightning strikes produce wildfires in the congressional district that I serve and many others. Our response to these events needs to improve, and it needs to happen quickly.  These disasters do not recognize congressional districts. These disasters do not target one area of our country over another and do not care about Republican or Democratic partisan gamesmanship. If we are going to adequately respond to the needs of millions of American citizens in the wake of these and future storms and future wildfires, we need to be advocating for sound policies based on science. This is the only way to protect future generations.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

892,topic-id,1471,"Mr.President, the Senate will consider this week four nominations for the U.courts of appeals. Two are well regarded professors at prestigious law schools, and two are highly respected State supreme court justices. Each of them has received the highest rating from the American Bar Association, ``well qualified,'' which my Democratic colleagues have said is the gold standard for evaluating nominees.  I applaud the majority leader for committing to do what it takes to confirm these nominees, including, if necessary, working through the weekend to get it done.  I want to address the state of the confirmation process by focusing on one of these nominees, as well as attempts to change the process itself.  Later today we will confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Seventh She has taught at the Notre Dame Law School for 15 years in fields that are especially relevant to the work of a Federal appellate judge. A distinguished and diverse group of more than 70 law professors at schools from Massachusetts to California and from Minnesota to Florida wrote that her scholarship is ``rigorous, fair-minded, respectful and constructive.''  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     May 19, 2017.     Re Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Court          of Appeals for the Seventh     Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.Senate,          Washington,     Dianne Feinstein,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.Senate,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: We are      writing to express our strong support for the nomination of      Professor Amy Coney Barrett to the U.Court of Appeals for      the Seventh We are a diverse group of law professors      who represent a broad range of fields and perspectives. We      share the belief, however, that Professor Barrett is      exceptionally well qualified to serve on the U.Court of      Appeals, and we urge the Senate to confirm her as a judge of      that court.       Professor Barrett has stellar credentials for this      position. She received her undergraduate degree magna cum      laude from Rhodes College and her law degree summa cum laude      from the University of Notre Dame, where she finished first      in her law school class. She served as a law clerk to Judge      Laurence Silberman of the U.Court of Appeals for the      D.Circuit and to Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme      After her clerkships, she practiced law in both trial      and appellate litigation in Washington, D.at Miller,      Cassidy, Larroca, & Lewin, and at Baker She has served      as a law professor at the University of Notre Dame since      2002.       As a law professor, Professor Barrett has distinguished      herself as an expert in procedure, interpretation, federal      courts, and constitutional law. She has published several      important and influential law review articles on these topics      in leading journals. Although we have differing perspectives      on the methods and conclusions in her work, we all agree that      Professor Barrett's contributions to legal scholarship are      rigorous, fair-minded, respectful, and constructive. Her work      demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issues and      challenges that federal courts confront in their daily work.      In addition, we admire Professor Barrett's strong commitment      to public service, including her work as a member of the      Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate      Procedure from 2010-2016.       In short, Professor Barrett's qualifications for a seat on      the U.Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit are first-     rate. She is a distinguished scholar in areas of law that      matter most for federal courts, and she enjoys wide respect      for her careful work, fair-minded disposition, and personal      integrity. We strongly urge her confirmation by the           Sincerely,       Jonathan Adler, Case Western Reserve University School      of Law, Johan Verheij Memorial Professor of Law; Richard      Albert, Boston College Law School, Professor of Law;

893,topic-id,2301,"Mr.President, the criticisms of Professor Barrett are laughable and ridiculous. One leftwing group, for example, objects because she has no judicial experience. I don't recall this group being concerned about the nearly 60 appeals court judges appointed by recent Democratic Presidents who had no prior judicial experience. In fact, President Clinton appointed a judge with a profile strikingly similar to Professor Barrett's--a woman who clerked on both the U.court of appeals and the U.Supreme Court and who, after a few years in private practice, taught at a well-known Midwestern law school for 15 years and then received the ABA's highest rating to serve on this very same court. Leftwing groups supported the Democratic President's nominee but opposed the Republican President's nominee.  It appears that Professor Barrett has one big strike against her, and that is her religious faith--an important part of her life, by the way. That is all it takes for her critics to say that she has no place on the Federal bench, that women or men with such personal religious faith cannot be impartial judges who respect the rule of law. That is bunk. It is ridiculous, it is despicable, it is stupid, and it is beneath the dignity of this body. I strongly reject that view. I find it appalling.  These critics apparently believe that judges decide cases based on their personal beliefs. They may believe that, but Professor Barrett certainly does not. In her hearings she pledged to unflinchingly follow all Supreme Court precedents. She said: ``It is never appropriate for a judge to apply their personal convictions whether derived from faith or personal conviction.'' This has been her view for nearly two decades.  In a 1998 law journal article she coauthored, she explored the real-world situation of how a judge should approach the death penalty when her religious beliefs counsel against capital punishment. Professor Barrett wrote that ``judges cannot, nor should they, try to align our legal system with the church's moral teaching whenever the two diverge.''  In her hearing, I asked Professor Barrett about this article and about what should happen when a judge faces a conflict between her personal views and the law. I wanted the record to be crystal clear so that her views would not be distorted or misrepresented. Here is what she said, as shown on this chart:       I believe that the law wins . . . if a judge ever felt that      for any reason she could not apply the law, her obligation is      to recuse. I totally reject and I have rejected throughout my      entire career the proposition that a judge should decide      cases based on a desire to reach a certain outcome.  Her critics appear, to put it most charitably, to have read a different article by a different Professor My Democratic colleagues observed that religious dogma and the law are different--so far, so good, as far as I am concerned. But then there is this: ``The dogma lives loudly within you, and that is of concern.'' Can you imagine, in this day and age, one of our colleagues asking a question like that?  Professor Barrett, as I described, has consistently argued for nearly 20 years that judges may not decide cases based on their personal religious beliefs. So what is the problem? It appears that the problem for some critics is not Professor Barrett's religious faith in general but the particular religious faith she has. Now this sounds disturbingly like a religious test for public office. In fact, it is a religious test by some of our colleagues, who ought to be ashamed of themselves.  I thought America's Founders put that to rest when they wrote article VI of the U.Constitution, prohibiting a religious test for public office. I thought we had grown past periods in our history when suspicion was leveled against someone running for public office simply because of the church to which he or she belonged. I thought the free exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment included being free from that kind of suspicion and prejudice.  Earlier today, the assistant Democratic leader tried to distract attention from the clearly inappropriate examination of Professor Barrett's religious beliefs. He suggested that by asking Professor Barrett whether a judge's personal beliefs should take precedence over the law is no different than expressing concern that ``the dogma lives loudly within you.''  Let me be clear. Inquiring whether a nominee will have her judicial priorities straight regarding the law and her personal views is one thing. Inquiring about her religious beliefs themselves is something very different, and I believe it should be off limits.  I enthusiastically support Professor Barrett's nomination precisely because she knows the difference between her personal beliefs and the law and she is completely committed to maintaining that distinction when she becomes a judge.  Let me now take a step back from this nominee and focus on the confirmation process itself.  The Constitution gives the power to nominate and appoint judges to the President and it gives the power of advice and consent to the Senate as a check on the The latest dispute about the Senate's part in this process concerns a practice used in the Judiciary Committee to highlight the views of Senators regarding judicial nominees who would serve in their Judiciary Committee chairmen have come to use a blue piece of paper to inquire about a home State Senator's views on a particular nominee. We call it the blue slip.  Today Democrats and their grassroots and media allies are demanding that the blue-slip process be used as a single-Senator veto, even though the vote is for a court of appeals judge who will represent a wide variety of States if not the whole country. They demand that a single home-State Senator be able, at any time and for any reason, to stop a nomination dead in its tracks without any Judiciary Committee consideration at all. That is ridiculous.  I can understand why they want to weaponize the blue slip like this. After all, they once used the filibuster to prevent confirmation of Republican judges but then abolished nomination filibusters so that no one else could use them. Today, Democrats are trying to turn the blue-slip process into a de facto filibuster. They want a single Senator to be able to do in the Judiciary Committee what it once took 41 Senators to do on the Senate floor.  Shortly after Democrats abolished nomination filibusters, Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy warned: ``As long as the blue-slip process is not being abused by home-state Senators, then I will see no reason to change that tradition.'' He was right. The key is to know when that line has been crossed, and Senator Leahy made that point.  I have served on the Judiciary Committee for more than 40 years. That experience leads me to suggest two things that can help us prevent abuse of this part of the confirmation process. The first thing to keep in mind is the history of the blue-slip process.  Now, 19 Senators have chaired the Judiciary Committee, including me, since this practice began in 1917--10[[Page S6904]]Democrats and 9 Only 2 of those 19 chairmen have treated the blue slip as a single-Senator veto. According to the Congressional Research Service, until the 1950s, no Judiciary Committee chairman treated a negative blue slip as a single-Senator veto. Home-State Senators could express their objections in confirmation hearings, and the Judiciary Committee might report a nomination to the Senate with a negative recommendation, but in each case the process moved forward.  Senator James Eastland, who was chairman when I first joined the Judiciary Committee--a Democrat--was the first chairman to treat a negative blue slip more like a veto. Since then, according to CRS, the blue-slip policy has been modified to ``prevent a home-state Senator from having such absolute power over the fate of a nominee from their state.''  Under Chairman Ted Kennedy, for example, a negative blue slip did not stop consideration of a nominee. Chairman Joe Biden actually put his policy in writing in a letter to President George H.Bush in early 1989. A negative blue slip, wrote Chairman Biden, would not be a veto if the administration had consulted with home-State When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1995 and again in 1997, I wrote the White House Counsel that I would continue the Biden policy.  The second thing to remember is the purpose of the blue-slip process. As I wrote in both 1995 and 1997, it is ``a courtesy the Committee has established to ensure that the prerogative of home state Senators to advise the committee of their views is protected.'' Nearly two decades later, in the 2014 op-ed I wrote for The Hill, I said the same thing--that highlighting the views of home-State Senators encourages genuine consultation with the Senate when the President chooses judicial nominees.  The history and purpose of the blue-slip process will help identify when it is being used properly and when it is being abused, and, believe me, confirmation abuses have occurred. Before 2001, for instance, only 1 percent of judicial nominees with no opposition were confirmed by a time-consuming rollcall vote. Under President George Bush that figure jumped to 56 percent.  Before 2001, there had been four filibusters of judicial nominees and no majority-supported judicial nominee had ever been defeated by a filibuster. Under President George Bush, Democrats conducted 20 filibusters and ultimately kept multiple appeals court nominees from being confirmed.  In July, we held another unnecessary cloture vote on a district court nominee.  After voting 97 to 0 to end the debate that no one apparently wanted in the first place, Democrats forced us to delay the confirmation vote by 2 more days. This was the first time in history that a unanimous cloture vote was not followed immediately by a confirmation vote.  What is going on here? What is wrong with our colleagues on the other side? Why are they doing this? They could have taken a few hours but instead took 2 weeks from the filing of the cloture motion to the final unanimous confirmation vote that took place here.  Now, this is not the only time Democrats forced cloture votes to slow consideration of nominees they end up supporting. What was the point of all that? It is simple. Democrats want to make confirming President Trump's judicial nominees as cumbersome and time-consuming as possible.  At this point in President Obama's first year, when Republicans were in the minority, the Senate took cloture votes on less than 1 percent of the executive and judicial branches--1 percent of all the nominees that we confirmed. This year, with Democrats in the minority playing confirmation spoiler, the Senate has been forced to take cloture votes on more than 27 percent of the nominees we confirmed. In fact, including those we take this week, Democrats have forced us to take 51 cloture votes on President Trump's nominees so far this year. That is seven times as many as during the combined first years of all nine Presidents since the cloture rule has applied to nominations.  These were the nominations under Obama and this is President What is going on here? That is seven times as many as during the combined first years of all nine Presidents since the cloture rule applied to nominations.  In 2013, Democrats abolished the ability of 41 Senators to prevent confirmation. Today, they are demanding the ability of just one Senator to prevent confirmation. If that is not an abuse of the confirmation ground rules, I don't know what is.  It would be a mistake to do to the blue-slip process what has been done to other elements of the Senate's advice and consent role. This can be prevented by following the less partisan guidance of history and purpose to chart our way forward.  The blue-slip process exists to highlight the views of home State Senators and of course to encourage the executive branch in this country--whoever is the President--to be open to the feelings of the home State Senators and to consult with them when choosing judicial nominees. If it is serving those purposes, the blue-slip process should not become yet another tactic for hijacking the President's power to appoint judges.  What we have going on here today with President Trump's nominees is hypocritical, and it is wrong. It is debilitating to the courts, and it is unconstitutional. It bothers me that my colleagues on the other side are doing this when they, themselves, were treated much more fairly by our side--not just much more fairly but absolutely more fairly. This is really pathetic. I hope we can somehow or other bring ourselves to treat each other on both sides better.  With regard to judges, whoever is President ought to be given great consideration for the choices. That is what we do when we elect a I know it is tough on the other side that President Trump is the President, but he is the President, and he is picking really excellent people for these judicial nominations. I hope we start changing this process and get it back to being a reasonable, effective, honest, and good process.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, that at 3:30 p.m. today, there be 30 minutes of postcloture time remaining on the Barrett nomination, equally divided between the leaders or their designees; that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the confirmation of the Barrett nomination; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.

281,topic-id,795,"Mr.President, I want to start by thanking my Republican colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, for her work on this legislation. In addition to her excellent work on the Intelligence Committee, her experience in homeland security and critical infrastructure was absolutely critical to the drafting of this legislation.  As current members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, we are continuing to work on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election. Yesterday, our committee held an important open hearing where we had representatives from companies such as Facebook, Google, and We know that Russian Government-linked actors purchased online advertisements last year in order to influence voters and, frankly, in order to divide Additionally, Russia used bots and trolls to spread misinformation and division organically through social media networks.  While the President has labeled reports of these ads as a ``hoax,'' now that Facebook has actually released many of those ads and acknowledged their extensive reach last year, I hope we can all agree that this is a problem which we must solve before future election cycles.  I have called on the Federal Election Commission to consider new guidance on how online advertisement platforms can better prevent foreign nationals from illicitly spending in future U.elections. I certainly support legislation to require the same transparency for online political ads that we currently enjoy for television or print or radio ads. These are simple, straightforward steps we can and must take to protect the sanctity of our democracy.  We also know, based on intelligence assessments, that as part of Russia's larger hostile effort to interfere in last year's election, Russian actors targeted State election voting centers and State-level voting registration databases--the very heart of the infrastructure we all rely on for free and fair elections. In my view, these intrusions demonstrate a troubling vulnerability to potential future cyber attacks and manipulations by foreign hackers of our elections and our democratic process.  Our democracy fundamentally hinges on protecting the rights of Americans to be able to fairly choose their own leaders. That is why I am proud to be partnering with Senator Collins in introducing the bipartisan Securing America's Voting Equipment Act, or the SAVE Act, to provide increased security for American election systems. I am proud to join Senator Collins on the floor today to demonstrate our commitment to being able to move forward in a bipartisan and pragmatic way to find solutions to protect the integrity of that voting process.  Our bipartisan legislation would permanently designate State-run election systems as ``critical infrastructure,'' and it would require the Department of Homeland Security to create a Federal grant program to help States upgrade the physical, electronic, and even the administrative components of their voting systems and develop those best practices that Senator Collins mentioned in her speech earlier.  The SAVE Act would also require the Director of National Intelligence to sponsor security clearances to the officials responsible for the administration and certification of Federal elections in each State--usually our secretaries of state. The Director of National Intelligence would then share all appropriate classified information with those State officials to help them protect their election systems from these kinds of security threats.  Finally, the SAVE Act would create a Federal competition that would award computer programmers who discover vulnerabilities in nonactive voting systems so that the equipment and the software vendors can work to fix those vulnerabilities.  The SAVE Act does not aim to tell States how to conduct their elections or what policies or procedures or equipment is best where they are; rather, this bill is designed to facilitate information sharing with States, to provide guidelines on how best to secure those systems, and to allow States to access funds to develop solutions and implement best practices in response to these threats.  I consulted closely with my own Secretary of State from New Mexico, Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, in drafting this legislation to ensure that it provides the security measures State election officials need to keep our voting systems secure. I commend Secretary Toulouse Oliver for her tremendous leadership in the effort to safeguard election infrastructure at the State level.  We are at a critical juncture in the Russia investigation in which the public is beginning to see the tactical evidence of how the Kremlin sought to influence our elections and divide our populous. Until we set up stronger protections of our election systems and take the necessary steps to prevent future foreign influence campaigns, our Nation's democratic institutions will remain vulnerable. But we have the tools to fix those vulnerabilities. I look forward to working with Senator Collins and all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we do that.

26,topic-id,428,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the Catholic War Veterans of America's Our Lady of Peace Post 1947 in Las Vegas, NV, and Dennis DeGree, Post 1947 first vice commander and Vegas native.  Post 1947 exemplifies their motto of ``For God, country, and home.'' The group works tirelessly to help veterans, their families, homeless veterans, and active duty personnel. I am deeply appreciative of these veteran members' sacrifices and service, as well as the group's efforts to support Nevadans who have answered our Nation's call.  Founded in 2006, Post 1947 is Nevada's first Catholic War Veterans of America post and one of 215 posts across the country. The organization offers a number of critical initiatives to the veteran and Las Vegas communities.  The group's youth programs include poster and essay contests, letter writing and get-well cards for hospitalized veterans, and the Eugene Roark Memorial Junior ROTC Scholarship Additionally, Post 1947 maintains and operates a food pantry, participates in homeless stand-downs, and educates and assists veterans, their families, widows, and orphans in obtaining VA medical care and benefits.  At the 82nd Annual Convention of the Catholic War Veterans held in Louis, MO, Post 1947 of Las Vegas was awarded Most Outstanding Post of 2017 out of 215 posts. This award was given to the post by the national department for best overall programs provided to all veterans regardless of religious ethnicity. Our Lady of Peace Post 1947 has won this award 8 of the past 10 years.  Post 1947 was recognized because of a successful veteran service organization program they implemented called the National Veterans Service Since opening in 2013, the National Veterans Service Office has been successful in obtaining over $10 million in awards to veterans. Remarkably, Our Lady of Peace Post 1947 has been named the Most Outstanding Welfare Program 9 of the past 10 years by the national department.  Post 1947's major achievements do not end there. Dennis DeGree, first vice commander of the group, was deservedly named Most Outstanding Catholic War Veteran of 2017 by the National Catholic War Mr.DeGree received the award ``for being the individual who, in the opinion of the National Department, has contributed most to the betterment of the CWV.''  It is clear that Post 1947's contributions have made Las Vegas a better place for Nevada's warriors and their families. As a lifelong Nevadan and the senior U.Senator for the Silver State, I am honored to recognize both Post 1947 and Dennis DeGree for lending a hand to those who have made sacrifices in the name of this great country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-30-pt1-PgS6873-3.txt,1863,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017,30,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
345,topic-id,1589,"Mr.President, this week, we have the unique opportunity to move forward on promises we made to the American people last year, confirming judges and providing tax relief to hard-working The American people sent us to Congress to complete this critical work, and we must stop at nothing to do it. We have already taken significant steps to address both of these issues by confirming 13 judges, with 5 more this week, and passing a budget with instructions for tax reform.  There is still much more that we need to do, and I stand ready to stay here until that job is done. Most people can't go home until their work is finished; I don't think we should either. Imagine dropping your car off at the auto mechanic and, instead of staying to finish the job, they leave at 3 p.m. to go home because that is convenient for their schedule; yet you still have to pay them for a full day's work. That is effectively what we have been doing here in Congress, and that needs to stop. We need to work as much as possible to ensure that the Federal judiciary is filled with judges that will uphold the Constitution and bring us closer to providing tax relief for the American people.  We need to have a fully occupied, fully functioning Federal judiciary to ensure that Americans' constitutional rights are upheld. In almost 10 months, we have started to address the issue of judicial vacancies by confirming 13 judges, most notably Justice Gorsuch, who has already served as a strong, conservative voice on the Supreme As a fellow westerner, I was proud to vote for such a qualified judge to serve in our Nation's highest  Beyond the vacancy we filled on the Supreme Court, there are vacancies on all levels of our Federal judiciary. We cannot forget the importance of every single court that makes up the Federal system. We must prioritize confirming judges to fill these openings, especially those deemed judicial emergencies. The fact that we have so many judicial emergencies is incredibly concerning and should be a wake-up call to all Senators, especially those who are slowing down this important process.  The President is continuing to send us well-qualified nominees, and Chairman Grassley has done an excellent job of moving nominees through the committee process. I am especially encouraged that this week we are confirming five more judges, including four circuit court judges. This is the pace we need to keep. If that means working 24/7 to continue confirming these constitutionalists, you can count me in. Confirming Federal judges is a unique duty of the U.Senate, and we cannot allow obstructionism from the other side of the aisle to prevent us from filling vacancies throughout the country.  It is clear that when judges are brought to the floor for a vote by a healthy majority, the gridlock being caused is purely political. Because of this, leadership is having to file cloture on all of these judicial nominees, and some of my colleagues across the aisle[[Page S6990]]are just running the debate clock on these nominees instead of actually debating. We have what is known as a 1-hour rule in the Senate, and I think it is time to start enforcing it.  Members are entitled to their opinions, and, as the deliberative body, we should debate nominees. But if you are going to debate a nominee, I think you actually need to come here and speak about them. You can't just hide behind your desk and run the debate clock. If you have a problem with a nominee, then you should come to the floor and voice your concerns. If you are not willing to do this, then you shouldn't hold this nominee hostage to an artificial clock. This is what is wrong in We should use debate time on a nominee to debate the nominee, and if there is no more debate, then we should vote on that nominee and move on to the next one.  The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy trial. As the body that confirms judges to make that constitutional right possible, we have a critical responsibility, and we need to do whatever it takes to fulfill this duty. In order to deliver swift justice throughout the country, these seats need to be filled.  I am ready and willing to work day and night, weekends and holidays, to do what Nevadans sent me to Washington to do and to accomplish. As the leader mentioned last week, we should work through the week of Hard-working Americans don't go home until their work is complete, and neither should we. That work also includes reforming our Tax Code, providing desperately needed relief to the middle class.  Today Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means Committee released a draft of their tax bill, which is another enormous step forward in providing meaningful tax relief to Nevadans and other hard-working Americans across this country. Middle-class tax relief is particularly critical to the residents of my home State of Whether it is the single mother from Gardnerville who doesn't receive child support, works full time, and is simply trying to make ends meet or the entrepreneur in Elko who is fighting hard to get his small business off the ground and wondering whether he will ever catch a break and be able to afford his first employee, I continue to hear from diligent, hard-working Nevada families and small business owners who are struggling to cover their expenses and get ahead in life.  For too many people, the American dream--previously achievable through hard work, sheer determination, and playing by the rules--feels as though it is slipping away. That is in part because, for too long, Nevadans and Americans across this country have faced stagnant wages and slow economic growth.  Under the failed economic policies of the previous administration, we have suffered through 8 years of historically low economic growth. In fact, in those 8 years, we didn't have a single year in which the economy grew by 3 percent. As a result, wages and workers suffered. As a result, job creation suffered. And as a result, middle-class Americans like you and your neighbors suffered.  We still bear the scars of the Obama-era economic policies today. Median household incomes in Nevada are $7,000 lower today than they were 10 years ago. Nevada families are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck than families living in nearly every other It is fair to say--in Nevada at least--the recession has never really ended. To me, this situation is unacceptable. I am doing everything in my power to right the economic wrongs that have been committed by the previous administration.  Under the leadership of the new administration, however, we are starting to see our economy improve. There are positive signs everywhere. Last week, the Commerce Department announced that for the second quarter in a row, the economy had grown by at least 3 percent. This impressive growth occurred despite hurricanes that destroyed the homes and businesses of our good friends and colleagues in Texas and in Despite these natural disasters, if 3 percent economic growth is possible under the leadership of President Trump and a unified Republican government, just think about how much more we can add to this growth by passing comprehensive tax reform.  As a member of that tax writing committee, I have been working with my colleagues to craft a tax package that accomplishes three major goals: First, create more jobs; second, increase wages; and third, boost Americans' competitiveness worldwide.  What does tax relief mean to you, the average Nevadan who works hard and is trying to provide a better life for his or her children and save for a secure retirement? It means cutting your taxes so that you can keep more of your hard-earned money. It means a bigger child tax credit to help you confront the increasing costs of raising children. It means a simpler and fairer tax code that you yourself can understand. Lower rates for business mean more jobs, higher wages, and growth in our communities--all of which will benefit you. Taken together, all these things mean that you will have a profound increase in your take-home pay and your economic opportunities.  A recent study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers found that reducing the corporate tax rate by 15 percent alone would increase household incomes by an average of $4,000. A similar study by a Boston University economist put the increase at $3,500. I don't know about you, but I think the average American could do a lot with an additional $3,500 to $4,000 in his or her bank account.  As a son of a school cook and an auto mechanic, I understand the discipline and the hard work that go into every dollar and every paycheck, and I am working to see that you have more of it in your back pocket. I am confident that we will fulfill these promises, but that will take a commitment from our colleagues to stay here and work.  In addition to overhauling the Tax Code and confirming judges, we have many other significant legislative responsibilities to complete. I believe we must spend as much time as necessary, including working through the scheduled November constituent work period, to fulfill our commitment to the American people.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

299,topic-id,506,"Mr.President, the American people depend on the Federal judiciary to be fair and unbiased. A judge should decide a case based on the facts at hand and the law, not in service of a particular ideology.  Over the past 9 months, I have been deeply concerned that President Trump is nominating judges to lifetime appointments on the Federal bench, people who share his ideology rather than judges who apply the law fairly and follow precedent. President Trump has made his ideology very clear during his first months in office: He is anti-immigrant, anti-union, anti-worker, and anti-woman. He prioritizes the interests of corporations over the rights of individuals. I am not often given to hyperbole, but in this case I am so alarmed by Donald Trump's nominees to the Federal bench that calling them extreme is not extreme.  Congress has a constitutional obligation, through advice and consent, to fight back against these types of appointments. This is particularly important for circuit court judges, but under Republican leadership, the Senate is shirking its responsibilities. Too often, we are forced to consider too many judges at one hearing.  The Judiciary Committee has already had nearly as many hearings with two circuit court nominees on the hearing agenda in 9 months as the Obama administration had in 8 years. Sometimes they even add district court and Department of Justice nominees to an already crammed hearing agenda. That is not right. Each circuit court nominee should be considered in a separate hearing.  There was a time when there was consensus that controversial nominees needed more scrutiny. Apparently, this President is sending us who he deems the best and the greatest nominees, and we are supposed to trust him that they will safeguard our rights and treat all Americans fairly. In short, this I cannot do.  The Senate Judiciary Committee has an obligation to vigorously vet and question these nominees, and we expect them to be honest, candid, and complete in their replies. We have had a number of very frustrating exchanges so far at these nomination hearings.  On several occasions, nominees have disavowed direct quotes of their past writings and comments, even when members of the committee repeat them word-for-word and follow up with specifics to the contrary. Sometimes the nominees will acknowledge their past statements, but they think we are naive enough to believe them when they say that, if confirmed, they will ``follow precedent.''  Give me a break. As circuit court judges, they will be involved in setting or rewriting precedent if the judge goes in that direction--which a judge could very well do. Some have even written that they think that is what lower court judges are permitted to do. I am talking about district court judges.

739,topic-id,484,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, this bill that we are debating today has been touted as Congress' solution to the longstanding issue of fire borrowing that has plagued the Forest  I represent a district that has experienced a lot of wildfire. Thankfully, the recent devastating fires in the North Bay were not caused by this fire-borrowing issue. They did not involve Federal public lands. However, I have had a lot of wildfire in my district over the years, and fire borrowing is a top priority for me. Unfortunately, as it is currently written, this bill introduces more problems than solutions on this issue. Let me explain.  The title in the bill pertaining to fire borrowing repurposes the Stafford Act, which Congress enacted to provide assistance to State and local governments in case of emergencies. This requires Congress to appropriate the 10-year average for wildfire suppression before the Forest Service can access emergency funds. That is not the way to solve this problem. In fact, I saw that just yesterday the administration issued a SAP because of this problematic provision.  If Congress is serious about fixing the budget issue, we should be making funds available ahead of an emergency situation, and we should remove the cost of fighting catastrophic fires from the agency's base budget. That will enable them to invest in proactive measures to make our forests more resilient and healthy.  Although the Rules Committee added title XI to this bill, which increased the overall cap for disaster spending, the problems with using the Stafford Act approach still remain.  The second point. This bill, essentially, is a gutting of environmental protections and an attack on sustainable forest management that threatens equal access to justice. We should just call it what it is.  Title I of this bill allows intensive logging projects of 10,000 to 30,000 acres each. That is as big as the entire city of San Projects of that size can proceed on Federal public lands without any environmental review under NEPA, without any compliance with the Endangered Species  Title II of the bill eliminates the requirement that the Forest Service consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service and, essentially, let's the Forest Service decide for itself if it wants to follow the Endangered Species Act consultation requirements regarding any of its projects on public lands.  Title III further chokes judicial review by prohibiting the recovery of attorneys' fees for any challenges to forest management activity under the Equal Access to Justice Act, including meritorious successful challenges. This severely limits public review of logging projects on Federal public lands.  How would any of these measures promote forest health? It wouldn't. So let's call this bill what it is. It is an environmental wrecking ball that weakens standards and protections, limits public participation in the review of Federal agency actions, and won't make our forests any healthier or safer.

547,topic-id,536,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and emerging companies are what drive the American economy. We meet them in our districts and see firsthand the benefits that their dreams, their innovations, and their hard work provide to our constituents and to our communities.  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk takers are critical to our country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over the past two decades. Sixty percent of all of the new jobs over the past two decades come from these small emerging companies.  Their ability to raise capital in the private markets is critical to the economic well-being of the United  So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage the success and growth of our small businesses and our startups. It is this notion that brings us to this legislation that we are discussing today.  Under current law, accredited investors are allowed to purchase securities that haven't been registered with the Securities and Exchange These types of offerings carry more risks than public offerings. The thought is that individuals with enough financial sophistication or net worth can bear the potential losses that may be associated with these types of securities.  How the law works today is that this definition of an accredited investor is solely based on wealth.  The ability to participate in a private offering should not be limited to individuals that pass some type of Federal Government assets test. Instead, the ability to participate should be expanded to include all individuals who demonstrate that they have sufficient understanding of the offering. That may be a doctor who has gone through the training and has an idea that a new piece of equipment might work for them; or a scientist who has done research in the lab who says: You know what, this makes sense to me, and they understand the risk that they are entering into.  Well, H.1585, the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act, introduced by Representative Schweikert and Representative Hill, will expand the definition of an accredited investor in a way that will appropriately increase the pool of potential investors, thereby providing additional investment opportunities for more Americans and enabling the businesses they invest in to create more jobs.  The expansion of the accredited investor definition will enhance the ability of many companies, particularly small and emerging companies and businesses, to raise capital and grow by increasing the pool of potential investors. These are investors, again, that are very knowledgeable about that particular area.  This will both provide greater investment opportunities for more Americans and will enable these businesses to begin investing to create more jobs.  H.1585 is a bipartisan bill that will help create jobs and a healthier economy. The bill provides Americans with more investment opportunities and enhances small companies' ability to raise capital.  This legislation overwhelmingly passed the Financial Services Committee by a bipartisan vote of 58-2, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this particular bill today.

This demonstrates that the regulatory costs associated with going public is deterring new and emerging companies from making the decision to go public.  Now, you may ask: Why is this important?

The Democrats are forcing cloture votes on nominees who have well over 60 votes in support. Last week, we held a cloture vote on Scott Scott Palk is from He is a guy who everybody likes. He doesn't have[[Page S6962]]any enemies out there. In fact, he was actually nominated by President He was not even nominated by this He ended up getting 79 votes. Still, the stall was there, and we had to wait and wait and wait. Meanwhile, things are not getting done that should be getting done. Furthermore, the agency positions that we have hardly ever held rollcall votes on are being forced to occupy floor time. There is no reason for these votes except to delay the work of the courts and our agencies.  I am very supportive of the leader's commitment to our courts and how he has prioritized judicial nominees. These nominations are extremely important and will ensure that the rule of law is upheld for, possibly, decades to come, benefiting all                    Environmental Protection Agency  However, there is an Agency that is doing work that is also important to all Americans and needs appointments, and that Agency is the Environmental Protection If there has been one Agency over the last 8 years that has run around and expanded its authority beyond congressional intent, it is the Putting confirmed appointees in place at the EPA will allow the President and Scott Pruitt to be successful in their efforts to rightsize that He has talked about that quite a bit. It is a bloated Agency that needs to be rightsized, and he needs help to do that.  Last week, I highlighted the great things that Scott Pruitt is doing as I was able to visit with him yesterday at the EPA and witness firsthand the implementation of new policies that will bring about positive changes in an Agency that has run roughshod over the American people. With the repeal of WOTUS and the Clean Power Plan, with the implementation of TSCA, in reforming the Agency by ending sue-and-settle processes, and by creating greater transparency on the EPA's Science Advisory Committee, he is really doing a great job.  By the way, yesterday, we had this event over there which had to do with the scientists. There are three Scientific Advisory Boards in the These are supposed to be made up of scientists who advise the policymakers as to what they are supposed to be doing. During the last administration, we discovered in just one of these that six out of seven of the appointees were actually recipients of grants from the In fact, I was over there, and I gave a little talk about those six. They actually received $119 million, and they are supposed to be unbiased in making policy. Obviously, this is one of the many things that he is going to make sure will no longer exist.  He is making it impossible for anyone who serves on a scientific advisory board to receive any grants from the How reasonable is that? Yet that is still a practice they use and one of the many things he is cleaning up there.  There is a lot of work still to do. The Agency needs its Assistant Administrators, who will work to implement many of the initiatives I have worked toward for years. The Environment and Public Works Committee has now voted out five Assistant Administrators and General Counsel nominees, and I hope we can move swiftly to get these well qualified nominees over to the EPA to bring their expertise to an Agency that desperately needs them. Unfortunately, Democrats have targeted two of these nominees and have disparaged them, their work, and their backgrounds.                   Nomination of Michael Dourson  Michael Dourson will be an excellent Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and will bring much needed expertise and experience to the office in charge of the TSCA reauthorization law. The TSCA bill was a huge success last year. It was done on a bipartisan basis. It is the first major reform bill in 40 years, and we were able to get that through. Yet we need to have a person as the Assistant Administrator to make sure it is done right.  Dourson has endured a coordinated campaign against him that misrepresents who he is and his record. There are groups working to paint Dourson as an ``industry scientist.''  What you will not hear from these groups is that much of his career experience comes from the EPA itself, where he worked for 15 years. During his years at the EPA, Dourson helped establish the Integrated Risk Information System, which helps identify and document the potential dangers of chemicals found in the environment. He also has the honor of having received four bronze medals from the EPA for this commendable work. Dourson also served on EPA's Scientific Advisory Board for 6 years and has held leadership roles with a number of relevant toxicology organizations, receiving several awards from his peers.  Since his time at EPA, Dourson has devoted his career to protecting public health by founding his own nonprofit that works to develop, review, and share risk assessments on various chemicals. His nonprofit work is mostly on behalf of government, with a minority of the work done at the request of various industries--many of these industries are very pro-environmental industries--as well as providing pro bono assistance to those in need of help. In other words, he used his expertise to help people who needed help and were not able to get it in any other way.  Naturally, the industry work is the part that environmental activists have focused on to prove their claims that his research is a rubberstamp for dangerous chemicals. They hold the perspective--which is a myth--that working at the request of industry must mean that you are evil.  As always, the reality is much different. On many occasions the nonprofit has developed risk assessments that did not support the industry sponsor and were the same or lower than the safe levels set by government. Furthermore, he has provided expert testimony against industry on several occasions. Unfortunately, the coordinated attack on Dourson will persist and a good man's reputation will continue to be put at risk.  I ask that the leader find floor time for Dourson as soon as possible so he can get back to work at an agency that he served commendably for many years and ensure that those who seek to tear him down do not win.                       Nomination of Bill Wehrum  I also ask that the leader prioritize another nominee that has also faced unfair and false attacks. I have known Bill Wehrum for years, and I have no doubt that he is the best choice to head the Office of Air and I regret that his first nomination to the EPA back during the George Bush administration was blocked by Senate It is my hope that we can correct that wrong and confirm him as one of the Assistant He has served the public and is widely recognized for his knowledge of the Clean Air  The Clean Air Act has been very successful. In fact, I was one of the original cosponsors of the Clean Air Act It has performed very well. He was very much involved in that also. So there is no one more qualified to head that Office of Air and Radiation than Mr.Wehrum, and I am sure of that. He has been consistently recognized as a leader and top lawyer in environmental law by such groups and publications as Chambers USA, the Legal 500 United States, and Washingtonian magazine.  He, too, has worked at the EPA in the past and will once again serve the Agency and the American people with integrity. Mr.Wehrum is also under attack for working on behalf of industry. The environmental industry--and it is an industry, as they, too, are working to secure money for themselves by pursuing an agenda of their sponsors--is lobbying against Mr.Wehrum because he wants to make regulations workable within the scope of the statute for the regulated community.  This is very curious to me because we want environmental regulations to improve our air quality without putting entire industries out of business--a balance that is a part of the Clean Air Those words are used in the Clean Air Act: The rules need to be workable and implementable without undue harm to our economy.  It is time that we returned some common sense and rule of law to the Environmental Protection We have taken the first and only step with the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, and Bill Wehrum is the next step toward that goal. Right now there has only been one confirmation, and that is for Scott  With the repeal of the Clean Power Plan sitting before the EPA, I ask that[[Page S6963]]the leader prioritize Mr.Wehrum's confirmation vote so that we can give the Office of Air and Radiation the leadership it needs to make the important policy objectives of the President and a majority of our colleagues and States a reality.  Again, we have five EPA nominees that have been voted out of committee, and we are now into November and only have one EPA appointee confirmed. We need to do better than that, and I think this is going to happen.  Let me just repeat some of the things that are going on in the Environmental Protection Scott Pruitt in his meeting yesterday called this to the attention of the American people. We knew it all the time, but people on the outside didn't know it and they were shocked. They found out that in the Scientific Advisory Board of the Obama administration, six of the seven on the board were direct recipients of grants from the EPA and they were making policy decisions for the Now, how bad is that? In fact, we added it up. I would state to the Chair that it came to $119 million going to six people who are on the board making decisions that affected the grants to go out. That is the type of thing that he is cleaning up. He has the guts to do it, and he is doing it.  I am anxious to get these two confirmed, and I am hopeful that will take place.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

420,topic-id,1432,"Mr.Speaker, today, the Republicans released their tax plan. Unsurprisingly, it is a gift-wrapped tax cut to the rich. Christmas came early, Mr.From huge corporate tax cuts to the elimination of the alternative minimum tax paid by the wealthiest Americans, this tax plan will hurt our economy and prioritize the top earners of our country. But there is one person--maybe a group of people--who is very thrilled about this tax plan, Mr.Speaker, and that person is Mr.Money Mr.Money Bags is really going to benefit from this tax plan.  First of all, the President himself will greatly benefit from the tax plan. It is impossible to know exactly how much because we still don't have his tax returns. He has refused to release them. We would really appreciate, and we demand, frankly, that the American[[Page H8425]]people know exactly how much he is going to benefit from this tax plan.  Mr.Speaker, as the vice chair of the House Budget Committee, I saw firsthand how the Republicans rammed through a budget plan that paved the way for the massive Ryan-McConnell tax giveaway to the wealthy. Frankly, as a new Member, I find it an affront to the legislative process and an affront to families across the United States in red and blue States alike that we did not have hearings on that budget, that we are not going to have hearings on this tax plan, which is a complete rewrite of the U.economy that is going to be pushed through, apparently, in 2 weeks or less. We still have no score on this because we just saw the details of a tax plan today.  The Republicans have made this habit of relying on fake logic and faulty assumptions. They did it with healthcare and the budget, and it is safe to assume that is what we are looking at here.  These cuts do not pay for themselves. Despite the claims that this tax plan is really going to help middle class Americans, the reality is that it is going to hurt millions of American families just to fast-track tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations.  If the Republicans are so opposed to so-called government handouts, as we are always told they are called, then why is it that they seem to be more willing to hand out everything we have to the wealthiest people in this Nation?  Now, we are still exploring all of the details of this tax plan that was just released today, but there is no question that this bill is going to make sure that the wealthiest individuals and the largest corporations in this country get a tax cut of a million dollars. If you happen to be in the top one-tenth of 1 percent, then bingo, Mr.Moneybags is going to get a million dollars in a tax cut every year.  Consider this: if this tax bill lines up with the budget resolution, then 80 percent of the Republican tax cut goes to the top 1 percent by 2027; the average tax cut for the top 1 percent in 2027 would be $207,000; for millionaires, the cut would be $230,000; and, as I said, for the top one-tenth of 1 percent, you get to have a million dollars a year. For the middle class, on the other hand, 42 million middle class households would face a tax increase.  Let's not be fooled by this idea that the standard deduction is going up, and let me tell you what that means. It means that, along with the standard deduction going up, you are also getting your credits for individual children taken away, the itemization of it.  So if you have a family with several children, as many Americans do, you will actually end up probably being able to deduct less.  Let's also be clear that when you eliminate the deduction for property taxes and State and local taxes, and you cut all of the services that are going to be required to be cut if you are going to pay for this tax cut, then you will end up paying more in your States, both in terms of the SALT deduction, but also in terms of all of the increased taxes you are going to have to pay at the local level to fund things like infrastructure and education.  Let's be clear that this plan gives a $4 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent and largest corporations, taxes 42 million working families more, and borrows millions from the future to give those tax cuts.  Last week, in the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment to the Republican budget resolution that would have stopped some of the most egregious impacts of the billionaire's budget.  My amendment would have said that none of the tax cuts proffered in this plan should apply to households in the top 1 percent of income earners. It would have plainly said that the United States is not in the business of giving massive tax cuts to those who are already incredibly wealthy.  Mr.Speaker, I talked about some of the millionaires in my district, because I do have some. I am fortunate to have a good economy in Seattle, where we have a $15 minimum wage, where we have paid family leave for everybody, yet business is still booming, the economy is doing well. We have people who have done well, and they would like to pay their fair share.  For decades, Republicans have prioritized the interests of corporations and the wealthiest ahead of working class families.  What is being proposed in this budget, this tax plan, is exactly what Republicans in Kansas proposed in 2012.  In 2012, a Republican Governor and Republican Legislature in Kansas passed through the same thing. They said: Let's make sure that we have tax benefits for these passthrough corporations--by the way, Donald Trump owns 500 passthrough corporations; he will benefit greatly from this--and let's make sure that we reduce the tax rates on the wealthiest. In doing so, we will make sure that we are investing in the economy.  That meant, by the way, all those tax cuts had to be paid for. So there was a $700 million cut to the Kansas State budget, which resulted in schools not being able to operate full time, resulted in roads being in disrepair, and ultimately resulted in Kansas' bond ratings going down.  In the end, that GDP growth that we were promised, the economic growth that was guaranteed if you were to put the money into the top corporations and the top income earners that were supposed to somehow trickle down, that growth never came to be.  So, guess what happened, Mr.Speaker? The Republican Legislature in Kansas rolled back those tax cuts. They said: That trickle down thing didn't work.  The promises of economic growth didn't work, and ultimately they had to move it back. Finally, Kansas is starting to come out of that by investing in working families.  Ultimately, I believe, and I think Democrats believe, if you invest in regular folks, if you put the money into working families, you give them a tax cut and you make sure that they are actually paying less, not more, even if you say that you are giving them a deduction, in the end, they are paying more in this tax plan. But if you invest the money there, instead of taking $270 billion that is proposed by repealing the estate tax--which only a tiny portion of people pay, by the way; that estate tax--and 5,400 families are going to get $270 billion in this Republican tax plan. I say, let's take that money and give it to working families instead of those.  I think that we have a lot of different options. The Congressional Progressive Caucus has put forward our own budget, a people's budget, with our own tax principles. The bottom line is: we believe in ordinary We believe if you invest there and you give people the opportunity to work in good jobs, to earn good wages, and to really make sure that they have dignity, respect, and can save for the future and send their kids to college, that ultimately builds our economy.  So I am really honored to be doing this Special Order hour with my good friends and colleagues. We are going to do a little bit of a back-and-forth here.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.Gallego) to have him talk a little bit about what we are hearing. Is it true? Is it hypocrisy? What do you think about those debts and deficits?  ",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8424-5.txt,1E+14,SENATE NEEDS TO TAKE UP HOUSE BILLS,2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
422,topic-id,146,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Gallego for his incredible leadership. One of the things, when we think about this plan, there is really--it is a three-step plan.  Number one, transfer trillions of dollars of wealth and tax cuts from middle class working families to the top 1 percent.  Number two, explode the deficit, which we know is part of this deal. We are going to explode the deficit.  Number three, use that exploding deficit as a way to cut spending.  But most of all, I am not sure that the numbers add up. So I wanted to ask my good friend from the Progressive Caucus, Representative Ted Lieu from California, to just weigh in with his wisdom around what exactly is going on with these numbers and what are we seeing in this budget. Does it add up?  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.Ted Lieu).  ",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8424-5.txt,1E+14,SENATE NEEDS TO TAKE UP HOUSE BILLS,2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
423,topic-id,1175,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative  I wanted to just point out that there was a study that was done out of Wharton on the tax plan. It wasn't on this most recent version, but I think the majority of the things that are in this are still true in what they analyzed. What they came out with and said is that the assumption of 3 percent growth does not make sense; that, really, what they are looking at is 1.3 to 1.4 percent, ultimately, growth, and that it would create a $10 trillion deficit over time. I believe it was $3 trillion in the first 10 years. I have to go back and check that number.  Essentially, what they are staying is it doesn't work. The person who actually wrote the 1981 tax cut under Ronald Reagan, who was working for Jack Kemp at the time, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post, I believe it was, and said: ``This theory of trickle-down economics doesn't work. We were wrong when we did that, when we said that back then, and it is wrong to look at that same idea today.''  Now, Representative Lieu said Democrats are not opposed to tax reform. That is right if it was real reform. We do think that the Tax Code could be simplified, that it could be fair so that small businesses and working families and folks who are really investing in the economy are the ones to get the benefits of any tax reform, that we would close some of the tax loopholes. Unfortunately, this is not tax reform. What has been proposed is not tax reform. It is tax giveaways to the wealthiest.  I want us to be very clear about what the majority is trying to do here. They are trying to rewrite the U.economy with absolutely no hearings. It is, frankly, outrageous that we would not even have a hearing on a major tax bill that is going to affect every single person in this country.  We should have hearings. I don't know what happened to regular order. People talk about regular order, but as a new Member who was just elected last year for my first year in Congress, I can tell you I have not seen regular order. I sat on the Judiciary We don't have hearings in the Judiciary The majority of the bills that come to the floor are bills that we have never had an opportunity to have a hearing on. When you look at this tax plan, I believe we should be able to have more than 2 weeks to vote on it.  I think every single American should understand what is in the plan and at least have the opportunity to decide whether or not it is beneficial for them. Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, I don't think that is happening.  Let me just summarize what we think is happening in this current[[Page H8427]]version of the tax proposal that has been put forward.  First of all, it is a win for the well connected and the wealthy. That is what the Ryan-McConnell tax bill is. President Trump promised the tax reform would benefit the middle class, not the wealthy; but, unfortunately, rhetoric does not match reality. Instead, this bill that we are looking at now would create a new passthrough loophole that wealthy individuals would exploit to lower their own taxes.  Just as an example, a version of this loophole was used by University of Kansas Basketball Coach Bill Self to avoid paying more than $125,000 in State taxes in 1 year alone. The alternative minimum tax, which we call the AMT, which ensures that the wealthy at least pay more of their fair share, is eliminated in the Ryan-McConnell plan.  While little is known about President Trump's taxes, we do know that, without the AMT, the President would have paid $31 million less in taxes in 2005 alone. So you see why Mr.Moneybags over here is so important to this discussion, because that is ultimately who is going to benefit.  Now, Speaker Ryan also believes, as I mentioned, that we should give a windfall to the ultrawealthy by eliminating the estate tax. Again, that estate tax is paid by less than 5,400 families across the Nation, and in 2016, not one person paid the estate tax in seven  So what happens to middle class families? Because if all these wealthy folks are going to get all the money, then the question is: So what happens for middle class families? Because that is really where the attention should be. That was what was promised by Donald  Speaker Ryan and the Republican establishment have attacked commonsense policies used by millions of middle class families in order to pay for this tax giveaway to the wealthy. So Republicans have taken away the ability to write off your State and local tax bills, forcing millions of families to pay taxes twice on the same dollar earned, except for property taxes, up to a mere $10,000. That is the cap that they are proposing on property taxes.  Americans that are hit with significant medical costs, for example, those who have cancer or ALS or Alzheimer's, would lose their ability to write off these costs under the Republican plan.  The Ryan-McConnell tax bill also eliminates deduction for personal casualty losses. A big blow if you are a victim of crime, theft, or disaster. It also excludes--it eliminates the exclusion for dependent care assistance program, which is an incredibly important benefit for working families.  So in the end, you just have to ask yourself: In order to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts to the wealthiest and the biggest corporations, what does that mean for working families?  It means working families are going to foot the bill over and over again. I believe this is a bad deal for middle class families, for America, and for our economy.  One last thing I forgot to mention is that there is actually an incentive. After all of the talk of bringing jobs back to America, there is actually an incentive in this bill to take work and jobs to a tax-haven country because the amount of taxes that you would pay on that is actually lower than the amount of taxes you would pay if you were to start a factory here in Iowa or Kansas or somewhere in the United If you were to actually create jobs here, you would have to pay a higher tax rate than if you were to create that same factory in some tax-haven country in other parts of the world where you don't have to pay--you would end up not paying the same amount of taxes. So this is a bad deal for middle class families.  I don't know if my friend, Mr.Jeffries, would like to speak on the tax excellence, so I am really thrilled now to be able to turn this over to a member of the Progressive Caucus, a leader on our Judiciary Committee, Representative Hakeem Jeffries from New  ",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8424-5.txt,1E+14,ENCOURAGING PUBLIC OFFERINGS ACT OF 2017,2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
425,topic-id,109,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Jeffries for laying that out so clearly.  I don't know how he feels about the idea that we haven't had a single hearing on this bill. We are hearing that we are going to vote on it in 2 weeks.  What is his experience? Since I am a new Member--I just joined this year--I thought we had regular order, I thought we got to debate things, I thought the minority got to speak up, and maybe we got to take ideas from both sides. What does he think about the idea that they are going to try to ram this thing in in 2 weeks?

427,topic-id,921,"Mr.Speaker, what strikes me is, when you don't have a process, you don't have discussion and debate, and you try to jam something through, it means you are trying to hide a whole lot. So I just wanted to say that there is an article in The Washington Post today about winners and losers in the Republican tax plan, and here is what they say are winners.  This isn't a Democrat saying this. This is The Washington Post saying, big corporations--number one winner, big corporations. American megabusinesses would get a substantial tax reduction.  And, by the way, that is not just on one level, that is a number of levels. And my colleagues over here know that this is the number one plan here, because there is a clear difference of opinion. You all think that, if you invest in these big corporations and in the wealthiest individuals, you would rather put your faith into those folks rather than middle class families across the country who could actually build our economy.  So this bill cuts the top rate that large corporations would have to pay the biggest one-time drop in the big business tax rate ever; I repeat, the biggest one-time drop in the big business tax rate ever.  On top of that, you would get some new tax breaks if you are a corporation, so you would get to lower your bills.  What I have seen in the polling is that Americans across the country think that corporations are already getting too good of a deal and they should pay their fair share. And what millions of struggling families across the country want is for somebody to actually fight for them, somebody to fight for people who are going to work every day, who are doing everything they can to have an American life that pays them enough money to get a job to put food on the table, to send their kids to college, to retire with dignity, a better deal than the raw deal that they are getting right now. But that is the number one winner.  The second biggest winner, according to The Washington Post: the superrich. And that was the estate tax that I mentioned, which only benefits 5,400 families across the United States who pay that estate tax. But we are going to put hundreds of billions of dollars into repealing the estate tax so that those 5,400 families can continue to earn more and more money on the backs of the middle class.  And, of course, the third one is anyone paying the alternative minimum tax. That is Donald The biggest part of his tax bill that he paid, on the one tax return that he released, was from the alternative minimum tax. But that alternative minimum tax is now getting eliminated in this bill to benefit Donald And it forces people who earn more than $130,000 to calculate their taxes twice.  There is one more. They said, ``Hedge funds, doctors, and lawyers''--that is the fourth one that they mention--as the wealthiest hedge fund managers, who are going to, ultimately, get a sizable discount, while ``under the GOP bill, high-earning small-business owners will only pay a tax rate of 25 percent on 30 percent of their business income,'' the passthrough business rate.  The reality is that even though there are some small businesses that are passthrough entities, most of those small businesses do not get the majority of their income as passthrough income, they get it from other things. The only people who really benefit from that passthrough are those hedge fund managers and folks like that.  Who are the losers? Small-business owners. The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 325,000 small businesses said: Uh-uh, we are not supporting the GOP bill. Why? ``It leaves too many small businesses behind.''  So Main Street is hurting under this proposal.  Who else? Like you said, people in high-tax blue So say good-bye to most of the State and local tax deductions from States like California, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and my My home State of Washington is really going to be hurt by this because we don't have an income tax, so we have very high property taxes, and we have very high other sales taxes. None of that would be--well, property tax, according to this plan, you would get a tiny, little cap on it of $10,000.  And then who else is a big loser? The working poor. Here is what The Washington Post says: ``While the bill includes lots of tax breaks for big businesses and the rich, the bottom 35 percent of Americans do not get any extra benefits.''                              {time}  1815  So there is one more loser here, which is interesting. It says, ``charities.''  The National Council of Nonprofits says that charitable deductions, when Americans chip in to take care of folks who have been hurt by disasters across the country or they contribute to nonprofits or others, that those charitable deductions are likely to go down under this bill because, interestingly and ironically, the Republicans still enable ``the wealthy to continue deducting[[Page H8429]]their charitable giving.'' But most people would not be able to get the tax break because they probably stop itemizing their deductions, so you would actually lose all of that.

429,topic-id,788,"I thank the gentleman from New York for his thoughts.  Once again, I would just draw your attention back to who the real big winner is here in this Republican tax plan. It is Mr. So if you have got money in bags, millions of dollars, if you are a large corporation, if you are a billionaire, then you are going to benefit from this plan--yes, you will. And you know who is going to pay for that is middle class working families across the country who are going to see their taxes go up, who are going to see their services cut, who are going to ultimately be a part of the plan that has three parts.  The number one part for the Republican plan is transfer trillions of dollars of wealth from middle class America to the wealthiest in the country who don't need it; number two, explode the deficit, because there is no way to pay for this unless you cut a bunch of stuff; and then, number three, cut more. Use the exploding deficit as an opportunity to cut spending even more: raid Social Security; raid Medicare; raid  This is all part of the budget that was passed last week by Let me say, there were 20 Republicans who voted against that budget, and I congratulate them for their courage in voting against that budget. It was a close vote. If we had just gotten a couple more, we would have been able to defeat that budget, and we would have been able to at least require a more thoughtful process for how we move forward on tax reform, because part of what that budget vote did is to allow this process to move forward with less democracy, with less vetting, and with less knowledge for the American people.  Once again, I would say that the only reason to do this without a real debate, to rewrite the American economy without a real debate, is if you want to hide who is going to benefit from it. We know who is going to benefit. It is right here. Mr.Moneybags is going to benefit. Working people are going to suffer.  So I know that we Democrats are absolutely committed to making sure that working families across this country, the vulnerable, the low-income, the folks who are struggling every day, who are just making it, who feel like this economy is not working for them because it is controlled by corporations, by lobbyists, by folks who are here not working for the American people but working for their own special interests, we know that Americans want that to stop. Unfortunately, this plan does not do that.  So Democrats are going to fight every step of the way. The Congressional Progressive Caucus is going to fight every step of the way. We have our own People's We have a real proposal for how to invest in infrastructure, in jobs, in education, in healthcare to make sure that Americans across the country, whether you are in a red State or a blue State, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, whether you are in rural America or urban America--I actually believe we all want the same things, which is we want to be able to put food on the table; we want to be able to put a roof over our head; we want to be able to go to a job and feel dignity about that job; we want to be able to send our kids to college or to higher education so they can get the skills and training they need and not be mired in student debt--across the country, $1.4 trillion of student debt that we have, even larger than credit card debt--and we want to be able to retire with dignity.  So, ultimately, my friends, what we are going to have to do as Democrats--and I hope that there are Republicans across the aisle who want the same things and who know that this is a bad deal for middle class families, for working families, for folks who are just struggling to make it, who want to have that better deal, better jobs, better future, we Democrats are going to fight for that.  I hope that we have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who recognize that their districts in blue States, red States, urban, and rural will suffer if this plan goes through.

1044,topic-id,982,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today because we do have a gun violence epidemic in this country, and the time to act is now.  Exactly 1 month ago today, we witnessed one of the most horrific mass shootings in our country's history, and Congress has done nothing. One month later, legislation on bump stocks has stalled. There is a deafening silence from the majority on any responsible actions on this public health crisis, even though, Mr.Speaker, a majority of Americans, including responsible gun owners, support responsible gun safety legislation.  Today, Mr.Speaker, I rise to share a statement written by my constituent Zach Elmore, who is here with us this morning. Zach's sister, Alicia Johnson, was shot in Las Thankfully, she survived. This is what he wrote as he sat next to her hospital bed as she recovered:  ``My sister was shot in Las I have never been more afraid, more angry in my entire life. The problem with shootings around the country is that, unless you know someone directly affected, it is easy to say `what a tragedy,' and move on with your daily life.  ``It is not so easy when you are getting ready for bed and one of your sisters calls inconsolably crying to tell you that another one of your sisters has been shot. It is not so easy when you call your mother and she is terrified and crying and all you can do is try to calm her down while you figure out how to get to your sister as quickly as possible. It is not so easy to see your brother-in-law with blood still on his hands from doing whatever he could to keep your sister alive. It is not so easy to see your sister in a hospital bed, unable to move due to a gunshot wound in her back and staples in her stomach from surgery to check for organ damage. We are among the luckiest ones.  ``I am sick and tired of thoughts and prayers. If thoughts and prayers had any affect whatsoever, there would be a lot of people still alive today. All these thoughts and prayers would have miraculously pulled bullets out of victims and healed wounds, would have stopped these massacres before they started.  ``You know what is better than thoughts and prayers and lines around the block at blood banks and enormous relief funds for victims of tragedy? Creating a society where we don't have to do these things many times a year.  ``We waited so long to do anything after Columbine that Virginia Tech happened. We still couldn't talk about it when the Aurora theater shooting happened. That didn't change anything, and then 20 children were murdered at Sandy Even that wasn't enough to promote change. When Dylann Roof happened, still couldn't talk about it, and then San Bernardino happened. We still couldn't bring ourselves to discuss gun control, and then the Pulse nightclub shooting happened.  ``Lord knows we can't do anything about guns, and then Las Vegas happened. And we are still being told that now is not the time, let healing begin, don't politicize tragedy, but by all means send thoughts and prayers to all affected by `insert massacre here.'  ``There is no place in society for any weapon which has the singular purpose to kill people. The man who killed and injured more than any massacre in America's history broke the mold for who commits mass shootings. He would have easily passed a background check and psych evaluation. He was affluent and had no known ties to terrorist organizations, but he is certainly a terrorist. The system we have in place allowed him to accumulate dozens of assault weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition because, for all intents and purposes, he was not a risk to society.  ``Let's keep in mind, the Second Amendment of the Constitution was written over 200 years ago when a good gunman might get three shots off a minute with a musket. It is hard for me to believe the Founding Fathers envisioned a world where one man could or would fire 400 rounds a minute into a crowd of people.  ``This should not be difficult. How many people have to die before people will apply a little logic to gun laws? Do more children need to die? Does a hospital need to be attacked? What is your limit? Does it have to happen to you or a loved one before you start to think differently about gun laws?  ``The people of this country have so much power. We have protested, pressured our Congressmen and -women, and we have seen that work. Why can't we do the same to reduce and hopefully eliminate the insane amount of gun violence in America?  ``Excuse me for not being willing to wait to let healing begin, for not accepting that now is not the time to talk about a major problem in this country. There is never a wrong time to stand up for what you think is right.  ``My sister was shot in Las Vegas in the latest of a devastatingly long line of mass shootings in this country. We are luckier than 58 people and their families, and likely luckier than many of the over 500 other people who were injured. If I don't talk about it, if we don't truly take steps to effect positive change, everyone reading this will forget it happened because they will be sending thoughts and prayers to the victims of the next mass shooting in America.''  Mr.Speaker, that is the end of the excerpt of his letter. Zach's family's experience illustrates why it is crucial for us to take a hard look at gun violence policies.  Mr.Speaker, I hope that we will, across the aisle, in a bipartisan fashion, do what is right for the American[[Page H8302]]people and protect families like Zach's across the country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8301-2.txt,1E+14,PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

424,topic-id,1037,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Jayapal, my good friend and tremendous colleague on both the House Budget Committee and the House Judiciary Committee, the distinguished gentlewoman from the great State of Washington, for her tremendous advocacy, for anchoring this Congressional Progressive Caucus Special Order, and for addressing the American people on this critically important issue, so-called tax reform put forth by House Republicans today in a manner that is clear-eyed, that is authentic, that is comprehensive, and that will hopefully awaken the American people to the notion that this is an attempt by House Republicans to do nothing more than to jam tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires down the throats of the American people.                              {time}  1800  Now, I represent the Eighth Congressional District in Brooklyn and I am proud to be a Member of the House of Representatives, proud to be from the city of New And we are generous people in New York City; generous people in New York In fact, New York State regularly sends tens of billions of dollars more to the Federal Government than we get back in return.  The State of Connecticut sends billions of dollars more to the Federal Government than they get back in return. So does New So does So does So does And, for decades, we have allowed that generosity to continue to show itself in terms of the fact that we get shortchanged in homeland security dollars, transportation and infrastructure dollars, and a whole host of other Federal funds that disproportionately make its way to other parts of the country, often to States in the deep  We are generous people. But at what point is enough enough? And today, you have crossed the line by putting a target on the backs of people in New York, and New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and Illinois, and California, and several other States, including people who live in places like Charleston, South Carolina, or other cities that may have relatively modest State taxes, if any at all, but who are taxed at the local level, or who pay property taxes.  And so everyone throughout the United States of America, tens of millions of people, are going to be hurt by this Republican tax plan, because of the limitations on deductibility related to State and local taxes, because of the draconian limitations on deducting property taxes, and because of the limitations placed on middle class homeowners as it relates to the mortgage interest deduction. You can't make this stuff up.  The Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme to provide a windfall to millionaires and billionaires, the wealthy and the well-off, to special interest corporations, and to hide it in the notion that it is a middle class tax cut. The Republican tax plan won't help the middle class. It will hurt the middle class. It is a Ponzi scheme. It will undermine Medicare and It will impose billions and billions of dollars in additional deficit. It will force your children and grandchildren to shoulder approximately $1.5 trillion in additional debt. And this is all being done in order to provide massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, the overwhelming majority of whom will be the ones who disproportionately benefit from the so-called tax reform plan. Yes, it is a Ponzi scheme.  And why do I say that? Well, because what you are going to hear is that trickle-down economic theory; supply-side economic theory; or the latest word craft that they have come up with, dynamic scoring, will result in a situation where these massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, and for special interest corporations, will somehow magically result in unprecedented economic growth. Sounds good.  The only problem is that it is a failed, fraudulent, and fake argument. It is a fantasy that has no basis in reality.  When Ronald Reagan, in 1981, cut taxes for the wealthy and for the well-off, we didn't get unprecedented economic growth, we got massive deficits.  When George Bush cut taxes for the wealthy and for the well-off in 2001 and 2003, we didn't get unprecedented economic growth, we got a Great Recession--the worst economic crisis since the Great  When the Republican Governor of Kansas moved forward with what he[[Page H8428]]called the Kansas experiment, massively cut taxes for the wealthy and for the well-off in Kansas, so much so that the wealthiest 300,000 folks from Kansas didn't pay a single dollar in taxes at all--the people of Kansas were promised unprecedented economic growth, unprecedented job creation--this is the Republican Governor of Kansas--when he cut taxes, you didn't get unprecedented economic growth. What you got were prison riots, overcrowded classrooms, and crumbling infrastructure.  The Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. Supply-side economics has failed; trickle-down economics has failed; dynamic scoring is a fantasy. We would say in Brooklyn: Don't believe the hype. We will surgically communicate to the American people why the Republican tax plan will hurt the middle class, hurt working families, hurt children, hurt senior citizens, and hurt those who aspire to be part of the middle class.  And one last point that I would make: I am shocked that you would put a target on the back of people who are paying State and local taxes--presumably because you think this is a deduction that the American people no longer deserve--but then in your same tax plan you allow corporations and businesses, wealthy titans of corporate America who run these companies, to continue to deduct State and local taxes on their corporate tax returns. Seriously? You don't even pretend to have equitable treatment? Oh, I forgot: corporations are people, too.  This is an extraordinary scheme that they are going to try to jam down the throats of the American people. But we are here, as Democrats, to make sure that the American people understand that you are being offered a raw deal. We are going to present to you and fight for a better deal for middle class tax cuts, for tax cuts for small businesses, tax cuts for working families, and to make sure that people in America continue to pay their fair share.

428,topic-id,402,"Well, I appreciate you going through that important list. I think it can be distilled, you know, quite simply.  The winners of the Republican tax plan are the billionaire boys club; the losers are the American people, everyday Americans, all premised, again, on, and you are going to hear this over and over again, dynamic scoring--sounds great--trickle-down economics.  You know, I figured out that trickle-down economics essentially means, for the middle class, you may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay down, because there is no evidence--no evidence from the Reagan experiment, no evidence from the Bush experiment, no evidence from the Brownback experiment in Kansas, no evidence--that if you cut taxes for the wealthy or the well off, for special interest corporations, whether you do it directly or through passthrough entities, that when you cut those taxes, it results in strong, unprecedented economic growth. In fact, our history tells us precisely the opposite.  Bill Clinton raised the top tax rate on high-income earners from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. Did we suffer from a recession as a result of increasing taxes on millionaires and billionaires so that they would pay their fair share? No, quite the opposite--unprecedented economic growth, 20 million-plus jobs created during 8 years of Bill  Then George Bush comes into town, and we actually had a balanced budget at that time. What does he do? Deficits don't matter according to the Bush administration. We are going to stimulate tremendous economic growth by cutting taxes on millionaires and billionaires because of trickle-down economics, supply-side economics, dynamic scoring, lower the tax rate from 39.6 on millionaires and billionaires to 35.

We lost more than 500,000 jobs in 8 years of the Bush  Barack Obama comes into town and we had all of these doom-and-gloom projections from my good friends on the other side in terms of what was going to happen.

Twelve million-plus private sector jobs were created during 8 years of the Obama  That is why I say that the Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme based on a failed, fraudulent, phony theory of trickle-down economics that has no basis in reality.

501,topic-id,1299,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the Children's Health Insurance We all know that healthcare is the most important thing in any person's life and in their family's life, and there is probably no healthcare issue that is more intense than a parents' concern about the health of their children. I think all of the offices in this building have heard from parents about the health of their kids over the course of the number of months we have been debating what to do about the Affordable Care  I rise today to talk about another critical program, which I hope we will act in a bipartisan way to reauthorize: the Children's Health Program, or CHIP builds on Medicaid, and it gives families who earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid an insurance option for their kids. In talking to families who avail themselves of this option--in Virginia, years ago we didn't do a very good job of enrolling kids in CHIP, and we have become an awful lot better at it. It is interesting to hear the way parents talk about it. They will often talk about how important CHIP is to them when their child is sick or when their child is injured, but what is interesting to me is how important it is to them when their child is perfectly fine--not sick, not injured. But if you are a parent, you are going to have anxiety when you go to bed every night if your child doesn't have insurance or coverage: What if something happens tomorrow? This is a program that provides not just healthcare but peace of mind for parents and their kids.  Between Virginia's separate CHIP program and the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security and CHIP-funded Medicaid, the State provides coverage to nearly 193,000 children. CHIP alone--the specific CHIP program--covers 66,000 kids in Virginia and also pregnant moms; 1,100 pregnant moms are covered right now. The coverage is important. It includes doctor visits, hospital care, prescription medicines, eyeglasses--which are critical to being successful in school--immunizations, and checkups for kids up to age[[Page S6949]]19, with minimal cost sharing and without premiums.  In Virginia, since 2009, when I was Governor, we extended CHIP to also allow dental coverage. That has been really important to children and their families. The program is one of the success stories in this body because it has been strongly bipartisan in support since its creation in 1997. But as the President knows, this program expired on September 30. Despite bipartisan work on the Finance Committee, we still have not seen a reauthorization bill come to the Senate floor.  The uncertainty surrounding CHIP has already started to have an influence on my constituents and the constituents of every Member of this body. According to our Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, the State will be forced to send letters on December 1, 2017, notifying families that there is an impending loss of coverage. If there is not a reauthorization bill done by that time, imagine the anxiety of all these families in the weeks before Christmas getting a letter in the mailbox saying that this CHIP program, which covers 66,000 kids and 1,100 pregnant women, is about to expire. This will, at a minimum, cause a great deal of anxiety and confusion, even if we then come back and fix it. But if we don't fix it, obviously, the anxiety and confusion becomes much more catastrophic for the families.  After we send out letters on December 1 telling families that they have to prepare for the elimination of this program, enrollment will freeze on January 1. No new children can come into the program. By the end of January--and this differs in different States--Virginia will have insufficient funds to continue the program. There are some States that are already experiencing running out of the funds they have for the program. Virginia has a little cushion, but that will take us only through the end of January if we don't reauthorize.  Here is something that makes matters worse in Virginia, and I think it is the case in most Our legislature is a part-time legislature. The legislature is not in session. The legislature does not come back in until January, and that will make it really difficult. We can't find time for solutions before then because the legislature is not in session. When the legislature comes back, that would be a lot to face in 2 weeks, which is when this program is going to expire.  Needless to say, the kids who use CHIP in Virginia are in all parts of the Just to give you some examples, the Hampton Roads area, the second largest metropolitan area in the State--Virginia Beach, Norfolk, and the Northern Neck--has over 5,000 kids who rely on In far southwest Virginia, where my wife's family is from--Appalachia--nearly 6,000 kids rely on It is a high poverty area, and in those parts of the State where poverty is high, CHIP is used in a very important way by families. The Shenandoah Valley, an agricultural area in western Virginia, has about 6,400 kids who rely on There is not a county, there is not a city in Virginia where there isn't a child and a pregnant woman who rely on this program.  On September 18--now to the good part of my talk, the positive words from my colleagues--Senators Hatch and Wyden introduced the bipartisan Keeping Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act, which is a bipartisan compromise in the best traditions of this body, to extend the CHIP program for 5 years to give States sufficient time to plan their budgets and make sure that families don't face the uncertainty related to getting notice letters saying that the program may terminate.  I rise today to urge my colleagues to strongly support bringing this bill to the floor and providing certainty to the families and children who rely on The possibility of all these families getting letters on December 1 saying that the program is possibly going to expire is just a needless uncertainty, and we should try to avoid that if we can, not just in Virginia but in every  My senior Senator, Mr.Warner, is also a strong supporter of the program. I will give him some props. When he was Governor of Virginia--he preceded me as Governor--he was the one who focused on doing a better job of enrolling kids in the program. I give him credit for that, and I will take credit for my teamwork and for adding dental coverage to But he was a great leader. He and I have together sent a letter to the Senate leader, Mr.McConnell, asking if he would bring a bipartisan bill to the floor quickly on behalf of Virginia's children.  This bill was bipartisan in its introduction, and with the number of cosponsors and the historic, bipartisan nature of support for this program, if we can get a floor vote on this bill, I think we can pass it today and send it to the House and do so in a way that we would avoid the need to start sending out termination letters to families, needlessly increasing their anxiety.  I will conclude by saying that if we can bring this to the floor, I think we can get it passed. It is an urgent issue for children across the country--and even more than children in some ways. The children aren't wandering around every day thinking about their healthcare, but their parents are wondering every day, worrying desperately about their healthcare. This would be a bill that would help both children and parents.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1008,topic-id,2385,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on a topic I have often spoken about on the floor.  We have been at continuous war since September 14, 2001, when Congress passed an Authorization for Use of Military Force to go after the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. That was 16 years, 1 month, and 18 days ago as of today.  The war in Afghanistan is the longest armed conflict in America's history, and it shows no signs of abating, even 6 years after the death of Osama bin The conflict has been going on for so long that many are somewhat immune to it. I heard a high schooler recently say: War is all I have ever known. It is the status quo. It is the background music to daily life.  Yet only 0.4 percent of the population of the United States serves in the military. That is down from 1.8 percent in 1968 and 8.7 percent in 1945, so it is increasingly unlikely that many of us even know those who are deployed and fighting in this ever-expanding global conflict.  Sadly, last week, for tragic reasons, these issues were brought to the forefront with the death of four brave American servicemembers in Niger: Army SGT La David Johnson, SGT Bryan Black, SGT Jeremiah Johnson, and SGT Dustin  Two of those killed--the two Sergeants Johnson--were part of a 12-man patrol whose mission is not clear. We know that their trained military occupational specialties--vehicle mechanic and chemical-biological specialist--were outside traditional combat roles.  In a June war powers letter, the Department of Defense described the mission of over 645 military personnel in Niger as ``advise and assist,'' but none of the varying accounts of what took place in early October seem to support that seemingly benign summary of what occurred.  Frustration over this lack of understanding of that mission and the events that transpired were shared by everyone from Secretary Mattis to all the Members here. I can't imagine what the servicemembers on duty and their families must be feeling. We see the strain that an ever-expanding operational commitment is having on our[[Page S6895]]military, from our servicemembers relying upon foreign countries or contractors to provide critical air support where servicemen are stranded on the battlefield for over a day, to our warships, for which schedules have been so strained that their crews are unable to safely navigate international waters.  Being a Senator from Virginia, a State with one of the largest military presences that is home to tens of thousands of servicemembers and their families, I have a personal responsibility to ensure that these strains don't lead to any more tragic mistakes.  The attack in Niger has also laid bare other issues: how little information is provided to Congress about U.troops deployed abroad equipped for combat; how little Congress exercises the authority and oversight of these issues and demands information to debate before the public; and the possible ``mission creep'' and growth of military forces in Africa--an increase by a factor of 17 over the past decade--in which hundreds of missions are being run daily in over 20 countries where there is no specific authorization for use of military force provided by The Niger operation really identified a gray area between advising and assisting in combat operations, which keeps some deployments just beyond the tripwire of requiring congressional notification.  SASC held a briefing last week with the Department of Defense to try to understand the scope of the Niger mission, the reason for the escalation of our footprint, and why this surprising attack left our troops without support for so long.  But beyond the immediate tactical answers, we need a strategic and fundamental understanding of how and where this country engages in military operations and if the war on terror has become the ``forever war'' with ever-changing objectives and no end in sight, absolving the need for Congress to weigh in and speak.  Yesterday, in Foreign Relations, we held a much overdue hearing on legal authorization for military force. We heard solid testimony and straightforward answers by Secretaries of State Tillerson and I am encouraged that we had the hearing, and I am encouraged that our chair, at the end of the hearing, expressed the desire to move forward to finally, after 16-plus years, engage in a debate and a congressional vote on war authorization.  I was disappointed that the two Secretaries, who were being candid, took the position that the Trump administration needs no more legal authority to do what they are doing. But I have to acknowledge the position they take is actually the position that the Obama administration took, and it is exactly the position that the Bush administration took, so I was not completely surprised. In fact, we shouldn't be surprised when the administration says: We don't need any more authority. But of course, we are not playing ``Mother May I'' on this question. It is Congress's role, pursuant to article I, to declare war.  I disagree with the legal analyses offered by all three administrations. I was tough on President Obama about this, as well, that the 60-word authorization from 2001 covers military action all over the globe. But there is some legal dispute about the question, still.  Beyond the legal question, there are also questions of moral authority, political authority, and the abdication of responsibility in this body. Seventy-five percent of the Members of Congress today were not even here when the 2001 authorization was passed and, thus, have never had to cast a vote on it, even as our men and women risk their lives and, in some instances, are killed in action.  Simply put, the 2001 AUMF has become a golden ticket that justifies U.military action against terrorist groups all over the globe without the need for additional congressional approval. I am not surprised the Executive wants to keep it that way. Who wouldn't prefer such flexibility? But we have a job to do.  Here is what we need to do. This is what I think needs to happen. We need to end the legal gymnastics with the 2001 AUMF--a 60-word authorization against the perpetrators of 9/11. Applying that now to the fight against ISIL, Boko Haram, and others is a stretch. The AUMF outlines the focus of military action as follows: ``Nations, organizations, or persons [the President] determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.''  There were 19 hijackers for the 9/11 attacks, and we have now used the 2001 AUMF in 37 instances to send forces prepared for combat and engaged in combat to 14 nations, including Libya, Turkey, Georgia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, the Philippines, and  Were all of these instances and nations and places really associated with planning or support of the attacks of 9/11? These legal interpretations are in addition to now countless ``train and advise'' missions around the world, to include those that took the lives of the four servicemembers in  This was not an unforeseen combat environment. I found this interesting. In April of 2014, the U.Government--the Department of the Navy--solicited contractual bids for ``Personnel Recovery, Casualty Evacuation, and Search and Rescue,'' aviation support in ``at risk'' environments in the following 14 countries: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Chad, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Togo, Tunisia and as directed by operational requirements. Only 5 of those 14 countries have ever been notified to Congress, pursuant to war powers letters, but we are planning to engage in casualty evacuation in connection with high-risk activities in all of these countries in  I would like to have a process that informs Congress--and informs the public--that is equal in transparency to what we put in contracting documents to inform military contractors. So Senator Flake and I have introduced an authorization for military force intended to keep the Congress and the American people not only informed of our military operations but also engaged in carrying out our constitutional duty. The intent is to recognize the fluid environment in which our military must operate to implement the counterterrorism campaign.  Terrorist organizations don't necessarily operate in just one country. They don't follow Geneva It is a different kind of military action, but the requirement for congressional approval is no less important. We need to make our legal authorities, which are now dated, current and appropriately scoped.  I applaud my Foreign Relations chair, Senator Corker, who, after the hearing yesterday, said that we would move to a markup and clearly, I suspect, an amendment of the proposal Senator Flake and I have put on the table. We have done a lot of work on it. A war authorization should be bipartisan. If anything in this body should be bipartisan, I think a war authorization should be. We don't pretend that we have thought of everything; we don't pretend that the bill cannot be improved.  In conclusion, I want to make a few comments. This week, the New York Times reported that President Trump has approved--without providing Members of Congress any information on why these changes are necessary--changes giving the Department of Defense and the CIA more latitude in pursuing ``counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids'' against Islamic terrorist groups scattered across the world, all while using the 2001 AUMF as its legal justification. This expansion of war will only continue to magnify and mutate and will do so without public scrutiny, unless and until Congress steps up to provide the oversight and legal authority we are required to do.  I have come to the floor of the Senate since I came here in 2013 to speak about war powers, to speak about a need to revise the War Powers Resolution of 1974, to critique and challenge President Obama around the Libya mission, which had no vote from Congress, and to critique President Obama--who is a personal friend--over the offensive campaign against ISIL without requiring a congressional vote. Since I was clear and repetitive in my critiques of President Obama for using war powers without Congress being involved, I am going to do the same with respect to President Trump.[[Page S6896]]  At the end of the day, my critique is more about this body. An Executive will overreach. An Executive will act, but that does not excuse inaction in this body.  I do worry about a progressive loosening of the rules from the Bush administration to the Obama administration to the Trump administration, which eventually has turned the 2001 AUMF into a golden ticket that allows for action against nonstate terrorist groups anywhere in the world on a Presidential say-so.  We shouldn't take our institutions and, frankly, the fairly radical rebalancing of powers in the Constitution for granted. When Madison and the other drafters put the declaration of war authority in the hands of Congress, they knew they were doing something pretty radical. They knew the world of the day--1787, 230 years ago last month--was a world of Kings, Emperors, Monarchs, Sultans, and War was primarily for the Executive, but they decided they wanted to do something different. Ten years after the Constitution was done, Thomas Jefferson, as President, was grappling with a nonstate terrorist group in Northern Africa--the Barbary Coast pirates--and what could be done about them? He wrote a letter to James Madison and asked what was behind the war-making powers in the Constitution's article Madison described it very well. He said: Our constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrates, that it is the Executive most interested in war and, thus, most prone to war. For this reason, we, with studied care, granted the question of war in the legislature.  They were trying to change human history. They were trying to say that we shouldn't be at war unless there was a legislative, collective judgment--not 116 years ago by 25 percent of the people who were there then, but a legislative, collective judgment expressed in an authorization that we should be in war. We are lacking that now.  It is not hard to imagine a future President, whether it is President Trump in the remainder of his term or Presidents in the future, using the expanding war authorities to increasingly justify initiating war without the permission of  We asked President Trump for the legal authority justifying the Syrian missile strike on Syria that he made in March, and they have not yet provided an answer about their legal authority. What Congress has done is basically told Presidents: You can do whatever you want. That has a way of creeping and growing, and I think it already has. I think the American people deserve better, but, especially, our troops deserve better.  I have said it before; I will say it again. I can't think of anything more publicly immoral--public, civic immorality--than ordering troops to risk their lives and be killed, as the four were in Niger, while Congress is unwilling to cast a vote because this would be a politically difficult vote: I would rather not vote; I would rather make the President do it and blame the President if it works out badly. A political calculation has caused Congress to abdicate a responsibility while others are shouldering the burdens of responsibility--and even losing their lives in the process.  Finally, Senator Jacob Javits wrote a book in 1973 entitled ``Who Makes War'' after Congress passed the War Powers Resolution during the Vietnam war. He offered a very prescient commentary. I will close here:       Many advocates of presidential prerogative in the field of      war and foreign policy seem to be arguing that the      President's powers as Commander in Chief are what the      President alone defines them to be. The implication that the      Presidency is beyond the range of congressional authority to      check in the exercise of the war powers raises a serious      constitutional danger. If we accept such a view we accept a      situation in which the American people are dependent solely      on the benign intent and good judgment of the incumbent      We may not always be fortunate enough to see a      person with such qualities in the White  With that, I yield the floor.

215,topic-id,538,"Madam Speaker, earlier this week a driver whom law enforcement has identified as Sayfullo Saipov, violently rammed his pickup truck into a crowd in Manhattan, killing 8 people and injuring 11. Local officials called it the deadliest attack since September 11, 2001, in that city.  My heart breaks for those who have lost their lives--for their families, for their friends, and for their colleagues--due to this violent act. Two Americans and six of whom were tourists visiting our Nation and New York City to experience the wonders of America's largest metropolis met the crass act, the murderous act of a terrorist.  Our Nation's deep gratitude goes out to the first responders. Imagine these heroic Americans who intervened under very chaotic circumstances to bring down this criminal. Imagine yourself in that position.  This attack raises many questions about how this individual came to America and how he was allowed to stay. The President's tweets obliquely blame this person or that person, some in Congress, some not in Congress, but he misses the larger point: our Federal Government, the legislative branch--the first defined in our Constitution--the executive branch, and the judicial branch, need to work together to tackle our flawed immigration system.                              {time}  1030  How can we make it more secure while upholding our values as a nation of immigrants?

We are supposed to be the adults in the A true leader would convene a working group of both parties, along with other experts, to tackle these security challenges brought to light again by this tragedy. Wouldn't that be constructive? Instead, there is more division. That is not a recipe for success.  Let's not forget a comprehensive bill passed in the Senate in 2013, on a vote of 68-32 and a bipartisan House companion bill that had 201 cosponsors, but the Republican-controlled House here refused to bring that bill to the floor for a vote. That bipartisan reform bill on immigration eliminated the diversity visa lottery by which the murderer got into this country. Imagine if that bill had been passed. We would be in a different position.  We can work together, but we must move past the fear-mongering, the talking points, the cheap political stunts to appeal to a media that runs 24/7 and just looks for more fodder. Our job in Congress is to defend our Constitution and, in so doing, defend liberty. This includes our primary responsibility to work together to assure that our people feel safe and secure. We defend the Constitution by defending and protecting them.  The goal must not be division. The goal cannot be shallow attention and tweets on social media and cable news. Our people have a higher calling that our Constitution defines. The recent terrible tragedy in New York City reminds us that unity is always powerful, and it surmounts division.  It is time for that unity in this Capitol, and I look for the leadership in the Presidency, in this Chamber, and in the judicial branch to achieve it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8392.txt,616,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3922, COMMUNITY HEALTH AND MEDICAL",2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.425, the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation  Mr.Speaker, I can't speak to the subject of terrorism without condemning the senseless and heinous attack that took place yesterday in New York My prayers are with all the individuals and families that were affected. My utmost respect goes to the New York City community that, once again, stands strong, stands together, unintimidated.  Mr.Speaker, I introduced this important piece of legislation, H.425, together with Chairman Poe of the Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and  As we have discussed, this legislation works to strengthen the tools we have at our disposal for combating terrorism. Put simply, the Secretary of State can refuse to issue or revoke the passport to any individual the Secretary determines is affiliated with or has aided, assisted, or abetted a designated foreign terrorist organization.  The terrorist treats that we face today are complex. Our Federal, State, and local agencies are fighting terrorism at a time when ISIS and other terrorist organizations are able to use new technologies and means of communication to connect with individuals around the globe to fund, to direct, and inspire acts of terror.  Modes of international travel are more accessible and affordable than ever, and cross-border flows of people and goods have increased as we have become more connected in the global world. While these are very positive developments for exchange, competitiveness, and quality of life, we also have to be sure we are managing the risks that go along with this increased connectivity.  We have to make it harder for anyone supporting terrorism to benefit from the increased ease of global movement. That is why our legislation is important. We must ensure that the Secretary of State has the clear authority to refuse a passport to anyone affiliated with or supporting a designated foreign terrorist organization.  This legislation provides that specific statutory authority, as well as improved congressional oversight, are in place. It is also important that there are safeguards in place in order for any law to be successful. That is why I am pleased that H.425 also includes a right of review for anyone whose passport has been refused or revoked.  It is absolutely possible to fight terrorism while still upholding protections for individuals' rights and the rule of law, and it is critical that we do both. In fighting to protect our communities and our democracy, we cannot compromise these very things we are fighting to protect.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Poe for joining me in introducing H.425, the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation I would like to also thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their support with this bill as well within the Foreign Affairs  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I urge that all of our colleagues join together in support of this important legislation.

749,topic-id,382,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment strikes section 311 from the bill. This section would create a forced arbitration program for forestry management. This section of the bill, in my view, usurps judicial oversight. While many agencies conduct quasi-judicial proceedings, there are still agency actions that are appealable to the courts.  Judicial oversight and separation of powers is a core principle of our democracy. The arbitration would be binding, effectively making the Secretary of Agriculture the final judge and depriving the courts of their oversight role.  While the bill terms this as discretionary arbitration, the discretion ultimately lies only with the Secretary of The public has no discretion over whether to submit to binding arbitration or not.  The public's right to challenge an action or inaction in court is an important check on the executive branch. Shielding an agency from review by independent Federal courts could harm access to justice.  The Secretary of Agriculture can designate any objection for binding arbitration up to ten times per year in each of the nine Forest Service regions and each of the 14 State regions.                              {time}  1630  This allows the Secretary of Agriculture to effectively dismiss about 230 cases every year. According to the Department of Justice, in 2016, the total amount of civil matters and cases brought against the United States with an environmental or land cause of action was only 350. This overly broad power would allow the agency to dismiss some of the most problematic cases every year.  The process also likely violates the nondelegation doctrine. That doctrine prohibits the exercise of constitutional authority given to any branch of government by another branch or nongovernmental private party.  Under the arbitration program set up by this bill, a private party objecting to a management proposal and forced into arbitration would be required to write their own proposal. The appointed arbitrator could then select that private party proposal as the final plan to be carried out by the agency. The arbitrator is not permitted to modify the proposal, and the decision would be binding.  I understand the need to streamline the process, but I think the forced arbitration really deprives people of their access to the courts, and that is why, Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

I think this is really about the separation of powers. If there is reform needed in the judiciary, those reforms should be in our courts, but they shouldn't appropriate the power to the Secretary of Agriculture who may have his own or her own views and not give a fair hearing to the environmental groups.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory  This is another classic example of a solution in search of a problem. Of all the things that we should be working on in Congress in a bipartisan fashion to improve and to fix the problems that exist within our healthcare system, we have legislation on the floor before us today that calls for the repeal of a nonexisting commission, based on nonconsistent spending cuts being proposed for Medicare, based on a nonconsistent cost of rate of increase in spending under the Medicare program, all of which is going to add $17.5 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years because this bill isn't paid for. And the irony is they are coming forward with this legislation, which will add another $18 billion to the debt, on the same day they release a tax bill that calls for an additional $1.5 trillion worth of deficit spending because the tax bill hasn't been offset. At some point and at some time, we have got to take a bipartisan stand on fiscal responsibility in this place again because it is not happening today.  Instead, we should be working on short-term, practical solutions to stabilize and bring more certainty to the health insurance marketplace, in light of what the administration is doing to completely undermine the marketplaces today. We ought to be working on delivery system reform proposals that will emphasize the establishment of accountable care organizations and medical homes and value-based purchasing and bundling arrangements and different alternative payment models to get us to a system of value, quality, and outcomes, and away from the fee-for-service payment for the volume of services, regardless of results.  Let's be honest, the real cost driver in our Federal budget--and it is true at the State and local level--has been healthcare costs because we have an aging population. That is the work that we should be working on together, is the delivery system reform and the payment reform, so we are aligning the incentives in the right direction where we are telling our healthcare providers: You will be compensated based on good results, not on how much you do.  There is a lot within the Affordable Care Act giving our providers the very tools in order to accomplish that, and we ought to be enhancing that here today. Instead, we are wasting time on a commission that, according to the CMS's own actuary, says, at the very earliest, it might be comprised in 2021. But, even then, it warrants us, with the mission that we have given it, that: Hey, you have got healthcare spending within the healthcare system that, Congress, you need to deal with. And then come back with recommendations. And then it is up to us to make corrective action at that time.  So all this talk about unelected bureaucrats making these decisions belies what the legislation actually calls for in the establishment of the This was, however, another important cost containment tool that was put into the Affordable Care Act to try to restrain the growth of healthcare spending. We need more of those type of ideas, rather than efforts today to remove those tools and then possibly see just unbridled healthcare spending in the future.  What is really disturbing is I know there is a lot of common ground in this area, yet the American people wouldn't know it, with this political ping-pong ball on healthcare reform going back and forth and the chaos and the confusion that it is causing, and that is unfortunate.  So, instead, today, we ought to first take steps to stabilize the insurance exchanges, rather than an administration that is doing everything they can to limit the enrollment during the signup period, which actually started yesterday and lasts until December 15. They have cut by 90 percent funding for marketing of the exchanges. They have cut by almost 50 percent the funding for our navigators back home who are trying to help people get affordable healthcare coverage in their lives. They ended the cost-share payments, which only increases the cost for healthcare for everyone else because of the risk that the insurance plans now face.  The other segment of the population that we should be focused on in helping is that 5 or 6 percent of the population that are in the individual market who don't qualify for premium tax credits because they are getting hammered today. You would think that would be another area of bipartisan commonality that we can come together on[[Page H8416]]to provide relief for those individuals who are in the individual market experiencing these higher premiums, part of it being done because of the elimination of the cost-sharing reduction payments, but, instead, nothing is being done on that front.  My friend from Michigan also pointed out that we should be having hearings about the cost of prescription drugs in committee. That is one of the main cost drivers within the healthcare system, yet there is deafening silence in the Halls of Congress when it comes to taking measure on that front, even though President Trump promised during the course of his campaign and even earlier this year to try to take some action in a bipartisan way to address drug costs.

The MCEDV has helped ensure there are direct service programs, shelters, transitional housing, and court advocacy available to everyone throughout our Not only do they partner with the nine member-projects mentioned above, but they also coordinate efforts and give voice to the education of the public, lawmakers, law enforcement, friends, and neighbors to make domestic violence a community-State-national and global issue that each of us has a responsibility to confront.  It is not possible to put words to the significant impact the MCEDV has had, the lives that have been saved, and terrifying existences turned into futures of peace. However, it would not be fair to their work to not acknowledge the lives that have been lost to domestic violence. All genders, all ages, all[[Page S6967]]races, all socio-economics categories, domestic violence knows no boundaries, and fear continues to be a strong silencer. However, with the support and services provided by the MCEDV and its membership, many victims have found exceptional strength to tell their story, found their courage to name the abuse and the abuser and support others to shine a light on this pandemic of violence.  I cannot overstate how awe-inspiring the exceptional staying power and determination of this coalition of advocates is and how impactful their efforts are. They have not only mobilized a state-wide interest in the topic of domestic violence but have also inspired people to work with them to even further strengthen the message that there is no excuse for domestic abuse. It has been said that peace in the world starts with peace in the home. Thank you to the MCEDV for living those words and helping to change the world for the better.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6966-4.txt,1724,THE GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA HAS A HUMAN RIGHTS CRISIS,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

729,topic-id,196,"Mr.Chairman, the Resilient Federal Forests Act contains many provisions that will give the Forest Service additional tools to better manage our national forests.  To keep our forests healthy and productive, we must ensure we have skilled loggers to safely work in those forests. I thank Representative Westerman for including my bill, the Future Logging Careers Act, in his bill that is on the floor today.  My bill will allow 16- and 17-year-olds to learn the logging business by working in family-owned mechanized logging operations under the supervision of their parents. That will allow the next generation of loggers to learn valuable skills, prepare to take over family businesses, and provide the wood products needed to support our economy.  I learned of the need for this bill after meeting two Idaho loggers from third-generation logging families, Tim Christopherson from Idaho County and Tom Mahon from Adams  Mahon's 16-year-old son, J.T., was working under his father's supervision when a Forest Service employee sent him home.

730,topic-id,2197,"With help from the families and the Associated Logging Contractors of Idaho, we crafted a solution that is good for families, good for rural America, and good for the American economy.  I am grateful for the bipartisan effort on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the National Wild Turkey Federation and a letter from the National Association of Counties, Western Interstate Region, in support of H.2936.                              National Wild Turkey Federation,                                     Edgefield, SC, June 26, 2017.     Rob Bishop,     Chairman, Natural Resources Committee,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Raul Grijalva,     Ranking Democrat, Natural Resources Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Bishop and Representative Grijalva: On behalf      of the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) and its 230,000      members, we urge you to take swift Committee action on H.     2936 the Resilient Federal Forest Act of 2017. The NWTF is a      leader in wildlife habitat conservation in North America and      is dedicated to the conservation of the wild turkey and      preservation of our hunting heritage. We are currently      working towards our 10-year Save the Save the Hunt      initiative in which we aim to conserve or enhance 4 million      acres of critical habitat, recruit 1.5 million hunters and      open 500,000 acres for outdoor enjoyment       Active forest management is crucial to establishing healthy      and sustainable forests and decisions for forest management      should be based on sound science. As such, the common sense      solutions offered in H.2936 are imperative to the health      and future of our nation's forests and important to the NWTF      to help achieve our objectives. In total, H.2936 has many      reasonable solutions to the challenges that the managing      agencies face to increase the pace and efficiency of active      forest management on our nation's federal lands. We take this      opportunity to highlight those solutions that we believe will      make the most immediate difference and offer recommendations      as to how we believe the bill can be further improved.       We support increased availability for Categorical      Exclusions (CE) in order to deal more effectively and      efficiently with threats like pests and disease and for      addressing urgent wildlife needs like critical habitat for      endangered species. We are especially supportive of the CE      that will allow for activities that enhance early      successional forests for wildlife habitat. Unlike some      critics of CEs who will suggest, they do not exempt the      action from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),      rather they apply the NEPA review to like or similar actions      to expedite the process. These are administered under Council      on Environmental Quality regulations and other guidance.      Increased use of CEs is one of the best opportunities we have      in the short term to increase the pace of active forest      management.       Funding the cost of fighting catastrophic wildfires outside      of the agency budget is paramount to the agency's ability to      deliver on other aspects of their mission. We are supportive      of a fix that will allow catastrophic wildfires to be      considered a disaster. Until agencies are freed from the      burden of fighting catastrophic wildfires through their      annual budgets we will be unable to make meaningful progress      towards proactive forest management. We recommend capping the      firefighting budget at the current 10-year average to protect      further erosion of the U.Forest Service budget in other      important mission delivery areas.       We support the bill's provisions for large scale      reforestation on fire-impacted lands. While public input and      review is essential to public lands management, currently it      can result in delayed action and result in an inability to      accomplish the necessary objectives. We believe the deadlines      set for plan development and public input, as well as the      prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary injunctions      strike a reasonable balance. We recommend that this provision      of the bill clarify that proper ecological restoration is      allowed as a mechanism to salvage forests post catastrophic      events as reforestation may not always be the best action for      the ecological good.       The NWTF strongly supports arbitration as an alternative to      litigation. This will conserve valuable U.Forest Service      resources and expedite work getting done on the ground.      Additionally, we support the provision that does not allow      plaintiffs challenging a forest management activity to      receive any award or payment obligated from the Claims and      Judgment       We support the approach for allowing evaluation of only      action/no-action alternatives for collaborative Forest Plans,      Resource Advisory Committee and Community Wildfire Protection      Plan projects. Limiting the number of alternatives will      expedite the development of environmental assessments and      allow work to get done on the ground more quickly. We also      support the requirement to look at consequences of a no-     action alternative as a no-action decision would still have      an impact on the resource.       We understand budget concerns counties face and are      supportive of a portion of retained receipts from stewardship      contracts going to the counties. Stewardship Contracting is      an important tool for active forest management. Ultimately      this change will remove one impediment to utilizing      Stewardship Contracting and help garner support from the      counties. We recommend modifying this section to reflect that      payment should come only from retained receipts on completed      projects, versus strictly from timber value within ongoing      projects. This will maintain the ``exchange of goods for      services'' function of Stewardship Contracting while also      preserving the balance of timber dollars and the investment      of matching funds from organizations like the NWTF to expand      the scope and scale of projects, thus accomplishing more      active management and fire protection across the landscape      and within counties.       We appreciate the recognition of the importance of funding      planning activities for forest management. We are concerned      that the provision could potentially provide justification      for the U.Forest Service staff to refrain from fully      utilizing product value and[[Page H8332]]     partner match dollars for on the ground work. While we feel      the 25% threshold is too high, the provision of allowing some      of the stewardship project revenues to cover the costs of      planning additional projects could be beneficial and      incentivize project planning.       We also appreciate the common-sense amendments to the      Endangered Species Act (ESA) that will improve the process of      protecting endangered and threatened species and their      habitat. The bill overturns the ``Cottonwood'' court      decision, which directs that if additional critical habitat      is designated under an approved Forest Plan or Resource      Management Plan, a section 7 programmatic re-consultation of      the entire Forest Plan needs to be done. The U.Fish and      Wildlife Service and the Obama Administration argued that the      section 7 consultation needs only to be done on the portion      of the project covering the additionally designated acreage      of critical habitat. The remedy in this bill will greatly      reduce the debilitating process that the federal court      decision directs. The bill also affirms current U.Fish and      Wildlife Service policy that no ESA section 7 consultation is      required if the U.Forest Service or Bureau of Land      Management determines through informal consultation that the      proposed action will not likely have an adverse affect on      species or critical habitat. We further support the 90 day      threshold on a CE established by this bill because it will      conserve agency resources and expedite management activities      on the ground.       We commend Congressman Westerman, the co-sponsors, and      Chairman Bishop for their dedication to restoring and      maintaining our federal forests under management informed by      science, and offering the appropriate reforms to management      practices. We respectfully urge that you expeditiously report      H.2936 out of Committee and to the House floor.           Sincerely,                                             Rebecca Humphries,     Chief Executive                                  ____                                                    June 21, 2017.     Bruce Westerman,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Westerman: On behalf of the National      Association of Counties (NACo) the only organization      representing the nation's 3,069 counties, parishes, and      boroughs, and the Western Interstate Region (WIR), we write      to express support for H.2936, the Resilient Federal      Forests Act of 2017. Thank you for your leadership in      introducing legislation to promote the active management of      our nation's federal lands and forests, reduce the risk of      catastrophic wildfire and promote collaborative approaches to      address natural resource management challenges.       The legislation will improve the health and wellbeing of      forest lands and forest communities by: promoting      collaboration and streamlining regulations for forest health      projects, protecting communities through wildfire risk      reduction, improving flexibility and fairness in forest      revenue sharing, and delegating the authority for Resource      Advisory Committees (RAC) appointments.Promoting Collaboration and Streamlining Regulations for Forest Health                                 Projects       Counties believe that active management of federal lands      and forests must be done in a sustainable manner that ensures      the health of our federal lands for generations to come. One      way to help ensure a balanced approach to address natural      resource management challenges is by promoting locally driven      collaborative processes that promote consensus driven      decision making. Counties across the United States have      engaged in collaborative efforts to address their natural      resources challenges. By bringing a broad cross-section of      local stakeholders into collaborative processes, counties,      industry, outdoorsmen, conservationists and federal and state      land managers have built consensus on some of the most      complex natural resource management challenges.       By authorizing limited and reasonable categorical      exclusions for projects that improve forest health and have      been developed through consensus based collaborative      processes, H.2936 builds upon these successes and provides      additional tools to help ensure that collaborative efforts      continue to work, accelerate and expand. Streamlining the      regulatory review of proposed forestry projects will increase      project implementation and the number of acres that are      treated.         Protecting Communities through Wildfire Risk Reduction       For the 26 percent of counties across the United States      that are home to federal forest lands, the health of our      national forests has a direct impact on the health and safety      of county residents. Healthy forests are less prone to      disease, insect infestation, and wildfire. While the causes      of catastrophic wildfire are complex, the status quo of      inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now      present a great risk to both communities and the environment.      Your legislation would help to correct this by requiring the      costs and benefits of a proposed forest project be weighed      against the costs and benefits of doing nothing to address      wildfire threats, disease and insect infestation, and their      impacts on local water supply and wildlife habitat.       Provisions of the legislation expediting regulatory      analysis for timber salvage after major wildfires are also      crucial, and will provide the Forest Service with the revenue      it needs to execute critical and time-sensitive post-fire      reforestation work.     Providing Flexibility and Equitable Sharing of Forest Revenues       In addition to improving forest health and reducing      wildfire risk for forest communities, increased active      management will generate more revenue for the federal      treasury and critical services provided by counties, and      promote job creation and economic growth in counties across      the nation. According to the American Forest and Paper      Association, forest products industries account for 4% of      U.manufacturing GDP and over $50 billion annually in wages      for approximately 900,000 employees. These jobs provide a      direct economic impact to many rural and forest counties      across the country.       The growth in stewardship contracting in recent years has      shown that a market-driven approach to forest management      projects can work to achieve both forest management goals and      increased forest production. Counties support and are active      partners in stewardship contracting initiatives across the      United NACo and WIR support provisions of H.2936      that authorize the equitable sharing of stewardship      contracting revenues with counties consistent with historic      practices. Forest revenue sharing payments support critical      county services such as transportation infrastructure and      education. America's counties look forward to working with      Congress to further strengthen forest revenue sharing between      counties and the federal government.       Since 2000, due to sharp declines in forest revenues, the      federal government has provided payments to forest counties      through the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program. The SRS      program provides a critical safety-net for forest counties      impacted by declines in forest production and the loss of      forest jobs and it will continue to be a critical program      until the declines in forest production can be fully      addressed. H.2936 reforms Title III of SRS that provide      much needed flexibility for counties to use a portion of SRS      funding to support law enforcement patrols and ensure county      first-responders have the equipment and training they need to      provide high-quality emergency services on forest service      land to county residents and the millions of public lands      visitors each year.    Delegating the Authority for Resource Advisory Committee (RAC)                               Appointments       Finally, counties support legislation to ensure rural      counties can actively coordinate with federal agencies      through flexibility in RAC membership and appointments. NACo      and WIR support allowing the U.Secretary of Agriculture      and U.Secretary of the Interior to delegate the authority      for appointing RAC members to agency leaders, such as      Regional Foresters or Bureau of Land Management State      Counties should be included in the development and      implementation of public lands management plans, and RACs      allow county leaders to actively participate in this process.      Your legislation would allow the Secretary to delegate RAC      appointment authority, and ensure locally-driven efforts to      better manage federal lands can begin in a timely manner.       NACo and WIR stand ready to work with you to promote      locally supported, consensus-driven solutions to address      management challenges, reduce the risk of catastrophic      wildfire, and increase economic activity on our federal      lands. NACo and WIR encourage swift passage of the Resilient      Federal Forests Act of 2017.

1007,topic-id,1522,"Mr.President, I have the opportunity to speak to this body today about Amy Her nomination is currently pending to be a circuit court judge. There is a pretty high standard for those individuals because they handle some incredibly difficult constitutional cases. What is good about this is that Amy Barrett meets the high standard for those qualifications.  Professor Barrett received her B.in English literature magna cum laude from Rhodes College and her J.summa cum laude from Notre Dame University Law School, where she served as executive editor of the Notre Dame Law  She currently serves as a research professor of law at Notre Dame University Law Professor Barrett teaches and researches in the areas of Federal courts, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation, publishing scholarship in leading legal journals, such as the Columbia, Virginia, and Texas Law Those aren't easy areas to be able to publish in or an easy professorship to be able to land.  Before joining Notre Dame, Professor Barrett clerked for Justice Scalia of the Supreme Court of the United States and for Judge Silberman of the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Following her clerkships, she was an associate, where she litigated constitutional, criminal, and commercial cases both in trial and appellate courts. Professor Barrett also served as a visiting associate professor at George Washington University Law  She seems to be eminently qualified. Then what seems to be the issue? Interestingly enough, she faced a very odd set of questions during her confirmation process--questions not about her legal scholarship, not about her qualifications, but, oddly enough, about her Catholic faith. It wasn't about her temperament. It wasn't about her fairness. It wasn't about scholarship. It was whether her Catholic faith would get in the way of her being a good judge. Quite frankly, it wasn't about whether she had chosen a faith; it was the problem that she actually seemed to live her faith that became a big challenge during the questioning time period.[[Page S6894]]  It is odd for us as Americans because this seems to be an issue we resolved 200-plus years ago. We resolved it in article VI of the Constitution, which says that there is no religious test for any officer of the United There is no requirement to be of a certain faith or, if you are of a certain faith, to take that faith off if you are going to serve in the United We have in our Constitution a protection not of freedom of worship, which I hear some people say--they are free to worship as they choose--that is not our constitutional protection. Our constitutional protection is the free exercise of your religion--not just that you can have a faith, but you can both have a faith and live your faith according to your own principles. That is consistent with who we are as Americans, that we allow any individual to have a faith and to live their faith both in their private and public life or to have no faith at all if they choose to have no faith at all. That is a decision for each  But we don't ask individuals--as has been asked of this individual--whether faith will be the big issue and whether faith becomes a question in whether they are capable to serve other fellow  What is so dangerous, quite frankly, about her Catholic faith and her Christian beliefs as far as her being a judge? Are people afraid that she will actually live out what the Book of Proverbs says--to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, speak for the rights of all who are destitute, speak up and judge fairly, defend the rights of the poor and the needy? Is that what everyone is afraid of, that she will actually live out that Biblical principle?  I am a little confused why comments, such as ``The dogma lives loudly within you,'' were said during her questioning in the committee, and there were other questions to challenge her Catholic faith. Faith is a choice that each individual has, and it is an extremely personal but also extremely important choice.  Some individuals in America--myself included--choose to look past the mundane, day-to-day events and to think there is someone and something higher than us. We don't just look at the creation around us; we wonder about the Creator who made it. We don't just wonder about cosmic dust smashing into each other; we ask a logical question: If cosmic dust were to smash into each other in space and create all there is, who made space and who made the cosmic dust that smashed into each other, and how did that happen? Faith drives us to ask harder questions and to look a little longer at things that other people just see as plain in front of them. We ask what is behind it. A lot of Americans do. It is not irrational; it is a part of who we are and a part of how we are made.  It is a challenge to us as Americans to be able to challenge an individual and to say: That person is so radical that they believe in things like do not murder, do not steal, do not covet, honor your father and mother, or even things as radical as, in whatever you do, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  It doesn't seem that radical of a belief that we would have to challenge and wonder whether one was able to be a judge if they believe in those things. We dare to believe in something beyond us, as do millions of other  I really thought that our Nation was past this, that our Nation that speaks so much of diversity and of being open to other ideas is somehow closing to people of faith. People who say they want to demand that everyone be included are afraid of people who have faith and live their faith. Why would that be? If we are going to be an open society, is it not open as well to people of faith to not only have a faith but to live their faith?  We hit a moment like this in the 1960s, and I thought we had moved past it. There was a Senator at that time who was running to be President of the United We know him as John  Senator Kennedy was speaking to a group of ministers in Houston, TX, in the 1960s, and he had to stand before them and explain his Catholic faith because, quite frankly, there was this buzz: Could someone be a Catholic and be President? What would that mean? Would you have difficulties with that?  The questions that were asked of Professor Barrett were strikingly similar to the questions that were asked of Senator Kennedy when he was running to be President of the United Here is how Senator Kennedy responded:       For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the      finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been,      and may some day be again, a Jew--or a Quaker or a Unitarian      or a It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist      preachers, for example, that helped lead to Jefferson's      statute of religious freedom. Today I may be the victim, but      tomorrow it may be you--until the whole fabric of our      harmonious society is ripped at a time of great national      peril. . . . And in fact, this is the kind of America for      which our forefathers died, when they fled here to escape      religious test oaths that denied office to members of less      favored churches; when they fought for the Constitution, the      Bill of Rights, and the Virginia Statute of Religious      Freedom; and when they fought at the shrine I visited today,      the  JFK had visited the Alamo that day.       For side by side with Bowie and Crockett died McCafferty      and Bailey and But no one knows whether they were      Catholic or not, for there was no religious test at the       Then he made this closing statement:       If I should lose on the real issues [of the Presidential      race], I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied      that I had tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this      election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans      lost their chance of being president on the day they were      baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser,      in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world,      in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people.  This should be a settled issue for us, not a divisive one. We are a diverse nation--diverse in backgrounds, perspectives, attitudes, and yes, diverse in faith.  I look forward to supporting Professor Barrett in this position, and I look forward to seeing her decisions as they come out of that court, consistent with the law--as she is well trained to be able to do--and consistent with our convictions as  With that, I yield the floor.

Despite having one of the largest economies in the world, one in five Californians live in poverty. Yet Republicans in Congress are pursuing one priority: tax breaks for billionaires and corporations.  Their tax package is Robin Hood in reverse: it steals from the poor and gives to the rich. And it will decimate It will cripple many essential programs like the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit.  This billionaires-first plan will devastate many States, including my home State of California will suffer tremendously. The earned income tax credit and child tax credit really has saved more than 1 million Californians from falling below the poverty line. Undermining the earned income tax credit and child tax credit would push millions of Californians even deeper into poverty.  Americans should not be forced to pay more than their fair share in order to give tax breaks to the ultrarich. Any tax plan that pushes even one more American deeper into poverty and forces middle-income people to pay more should not even be on the table.  Mr.Speaker, we need to reject this plan that lavishes tax breaks on President Trump, his billionaire buddies, and giant multinational corporations.[[Page H8287]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-10-31-pt1-PgH8286-6.txt,1501,INDIANA DUNES NATIONAL PARK ACT,2017,31,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
665,topic-id,606,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this is really the question: Why in the world are we taking up a bill to terminate a board that does not exist? Why in the world are we doing so when premiums are rising and action should be taken to strengthen them? Why in the world are we passing a bill that would increase the deficit by $17.6 billion? Pay for CHIP, the Republicans say, but not this bill.  So however you feel about IPAB, this is the wrong time and the wrong bill for addressing it. The ACA enrollment period began yesterday, and because of actions of the Trump administration, consumers across the country face confusion and instability in the market.  Rather than addressing these urgent issues, we are engaged today in a political exercise to repeal IPAB, a board that has no members under a provision that has never taken effect and is not projected to be triggered before 2021, according to CMS actuaries.  In September, every Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee wrote to Chairman Brady urging bipartisan action to stabilize the insurance market. But after repeated requests, we never received a response from the chairman, and, to date, the House has taken no action on behalf of consumers.  In the meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to work to undermine the law and access to healthcare by: one, cutting off funding for cost-sharing assistance for moderate-income enrollees; two, slashing funds to navigators that help consumers enroll in coverage--the biggest navigator in Michigan had its funding cut by 90 percent; three, shortening the enrollment period; four, shutting down healthcare.gov on weekends; and five, proposing to chip away at consumer protections through executive fiat.  These actions have significantly contributed to insurers exiting the market and raising premiums. It is nothing less than direct and deliberate sabotage; so, instead, the Republicans today bring up a bill about a board that does not exist, and the latest is it would not until 2021, at the earliest.  There are simple actions that we can take today to repair some of the damage and, thereby, improve the insurance markets. Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray recently came to a bipartisan agreement that would provide funding for the cost-sharing reductions and outreach and enrollment activities that strengthen the risk pool in the marketplace.  Unfortunately, as we see today, my Republican colleagues continue to ignore these and other important issues, while allowing an administration, obsessed with repeal of ACA, to do so through executive action what could not be done legislatively.  What is more, they are bringing to the floor today a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will raise the deficit by $17.5 billion over the next decade. I repeat, raise the deficit by $17.5 billion over the next decade. And this is just a small preview of the coming GOP tax bill, which would increase our Nation's debt by $1.5 trillion according to the Republican's own budget resolution.  And whatever happened to the crocodile tears we used to hear from Republicans about the deficit? In terms of today's bill lacking any offset, how about at least starting to address the staggering cost of prescription drugs, a step that would save both senior citizens and the Medicare program money.  Mr.Speaker, the American people need Congress to take action to lower their healthcare costs and to stabilize the markets. They do not need today an irrelevant political bill such as H.849. If you support real steps to lower health insurance premiums now, vote ``no'' on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I want to say this to my colleagues, whom I very much respect, who signed on to this bill, many of them early on this year. There have been three changes of circumstance:  First, right then, it appeared that IPAB might come into existence in 2017. Now the actuary has made clear that will not happen under these circumstances until 2021.  Secondly, since the bill was introduced, circumstances have changed. The administration has taken steps to undercut healthcare for So because of cost-sharing and other issues, premiums have been rising. That is a second change of circumstance why this is the wrong bill at the wrong time.  Third, the last time it came up, it was paid for. In the Committee on Ways and Means, when we raised this issue, we were told, as always: Well, we don't have to pay for it in the committee, but it can be paid for on the floor.  This is totally unpaid for, zero, no effort to pay for it, and it would add $17.5 billion to the national debt. Already, it is at its record level with, now, the threat of $1.5 trillion more.  So I really urge, no matter what were the circumstances when you signed on, in almost every case they have changed, and so there is such good reason why this is the wrong bill at the wrong time, and I think to vote for this is really the wrong vote.

41,topic-id,1134,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus to speak on the issue of climate change. The caucus is a bipartisan group of members committed to implementing economically viable options to reduce climate risk.  The caucus has a ``Noah's Ark'' membership rule. Members can only join in pairs, one from each party. Under the leadership of co-chairs Mr.Curbelo and Mr.Deutch, the caucus is helping to break the partisan gridlock on this issue and show that promoting climate solutions can be truly bipartisan.  The formation and rapid growth of the Climate Solutions Caucus represents a recognition of both the challenges and opportunities and has demonstrated that there is bipartisan will to take action.  In recognition of the fact that 60 Members of Congress have come together to fight climate change in a bipartisan fashion, I organized this time for my colleagues to join me on the floor to let the American people know what we, as their elected leaders, are doing to address climate change.  We know, from scientific evidence, that our climate is changing. The global average temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 100 years. Sea levels are rising, the ocean is becoming more acidic, precipitation patterns are changing, and heat waves are becoming more frequent and longer in duration.  Each of these changes produces a cascade of effects that impact our lives and livelihoods, including flooding, changes in crop yields, power shortages, declines in fisheries, and increases in cardiovascular disease.  Recent events in our own country, such as devastating hurricanes in the Southeast and wildfires in the West have brought this issue to the forefront of everyone's minds. Now climate[[Page H8375]]change can't be directly blamed for all these problems, but the evidence strongly suggests that it contributes to each of them, and there are things that we can do to limit its effects.  Climate change also has a significant impact on public health. A groundbreaking study published just this week in a medical journal, The Lancet, unequivocally showed that climate change is a serious public health threat. The study involved 24 institutions from around the world and included staggering statistics, such as the fact that air pollution caused 1.9 million premature deaths in Asia in 2015, and that the range of common disease-transmitting mosquitoes increased 9.5 percent since 1950.  We know that high temperatures exasperate health problems and that burning fossil fuels creates pollution that causes cardiovascular disease. The National Academies estimate that air pollution causes around $120 billion per year in health-related damages, including healthcare costs, missed days of work and school, and premature death.  We also know that changing climate has altered the range, in some cases accelerated the spread of vector-borne diseases likes Zika and the West Nile virus. Responsibly transitioning to a clean energy economy will not only reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, but it will also reduce air pollution and help all Americans breathe easier.  What I want to talk about for a few minutes, before I turn to some of my colleagues, is a very common misperception about the relationship between implementing climate solutions and growing jobs.  Some people think that this is a zero-sum game. That is, they think if you have more of one, you get less of the other. But that is simply not true.  Implementing climate solutions can grow jobs, especially new high-paying jobs. The U.needs to take advantage of these economic opportunities. Regardless of what we do here in the U.S., the rest of the world has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reaching the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, as have many cities, States, and companies here at home.  To achieve that goal, significant technological development and innovation will be needed, as well as infrastructure, markets, and distribution channels to get that technology to the people and places that need it.  The national economies that produce this clean energy technology will benefit greatly. The U.still leads the world in technology and innovation. Countries around the world try to recreate the innovation ethos that exists in Silicon Valley and in other places across our  The United States also has the workers who are needed to build these innovations. So we have what it takes, and if we seize the opportunity to invest in clean and climate-resilient technologies, then our economy and the American people will benefit as the world adapts to climate change and America grows good-paying jobs all across our  But if we let this opportunity pass us by, then profits and jobs will instead flow to foreign countries that develop the technologies the world needs, and American cities and States will be forced to buy foreign products as they upgrade to climate-resilient infrastructure.                              {time}  2000  That is why I will soon be introducing a bill called Challenges and Prizes for Climate This bill will establish five or more prize challenges overseen by the Department of Energy to harness the ingenuity of the research community in the private sector to solve big, complex climate problems.  Challenges have been used in the past by a wide range of organizations, including the XPRIZE, who used the challenge to jump-start the commercial space transportation industry. This industry is now flourishing.  I was just recently at SpaceX in California and saw their impressive manufacturing facility they have there. The U.is now relying on SpaceX in order to bring supplies up to the International Space Station and their plans to soon be flying astronauts. This commercial space transportation industry began with those who reached to try to meet this challenge and get the  The Federal Trade Commission also used the prize challenge to help bring a robocall blocking service to the market, something that we can all very much appreciate. That is why I am going this direction.  My bill will create challenges that fall under five themes: carbon capture and reuse, energy efficiency, energy storage, climate adaptation and resiliency, and data analytics for better climate predictions.  Using authority from the America COMPETES Act, the Department of Energy will convene working groups from across agencies, universities, nonprofits and the private sector to help plan the challenges, and even to contribute to the prizes.  The goal of the challenge is not just to reward the winner of the best solution, but also to bring visibility to the range of innovations competing for the prize and to help society envision the future. This bill will help us see what our clean energy future will look like, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Speaker, I want to begin hearing from the bipartisan group of climate leaders who have joined me here on the floor this evening.

43,topic-id,901,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Fitzpatrick for his leadership and jumping in, in his firm term here in the House leadership, on coming to solutions on climate change.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.McNerney), my colleague who I have been working with for a number of years here in the House, a very dedicated Member, especially when it comes to issues of science and climate change.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Lipinski for his leadership on this.  Mr.Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about climate. We know that climate is changing, and we have seen it.[[Page H8376]]In California, we had horrific wildfires that claimed 40 lives and destroyed thousands of structures. We have seen hurricanes more frequently, more devastating, and more powerful than ever before. So the effects are there. We see it happening.  Now, the thing that we are faced with is that there is a significant section of people that deny climate change. You can sort of see why they are denying it. I mean, if something is in your interest, you are going to be able to talk yourself into just about anything.  The big benefit of denying climate change is that we can continue to use fossil fuels. If you are a company that uses fossil fuels or produces fossil fuels, yeah, this is what you want. But there are costs of denial, and the costs of denial are clear.  We are seeing weather. We just talked about that. We are seeing health effects. We have seen that both in terms of elevated temperatures, causing people to have heat problems. We are seeing disease vectors moving to the temperate zones from the We are also going to see significant infrastructure costs, like we see in Puerto Rico now. These are real costs that we are going to pay for the denial of climate change.  Now, what are the benefits of climate change?  Well, there are significant benefits, from my point of view.  First of all, we have been spending American taxpayer dollars to develop technology to fight climate change, or to reduce carbon emissions.  I will tell you a little story about my own career. I was working at a company called U.Wind With some amount of taxpayer dollars, we developed the leading technology for wind energy. Of course, what happened was that the funding stopped, tax credits ended, and that technology that we developed with taxpayer dollars went to They built thousands of windmills in Germany, and they made a lot of money based on that technology that we developed and paid for right in the United States of  We also know that renewable energy production creates more jobs than fossil fuel production for the same amount of energy. We are talking about a potential to create millions of jobs in this country. Not only that, but renewable energy has a stable price market feature. Unlike fossil fuels, which have highs and lows over a 10-year cycle, fossil fuels are going to be nice and stable, will be predictable. And businesses love predictability. So I think this is also another very good argument.  Lastly, if we reduce fossil fuels and go to clean energy, we are going to have cleaner air and cleaner water, a healthier environment, and we can reach sustainability. I think the benefits are pretty clear.  So where are we now?  Well, there are still significant resources out there determined to muddy the waters and confuse people about climate change. I have three publications here I want to illustrate. One is called ``Clexit for a Brighter Future.'' Now, the point of this is that we need to exit the Paris and United States climate treaties because fossil fuels are what we need to power the future.  Another one is called ``The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism.'' This one, if you look it up, is biased, and it seems to be paid for by oil interests.  The last one I want to show is a respected magazine that is called National And the cover page shows ``The War on Science.''  So I think we have a pretty good case to make for moving forward with action on climate change.  There will be significant costs if we don't. Renewable energy is more than cost competitive these days. As I mentioned, I worked in the wind energy business. We see wind and solar being more cost competitive--more than cost competitive, really--with coal and oil for energy production.  So we have the technology, we have the means, and we have the desire to do this, yet we are still hung up here in Washington in terms of following through with government support that is needed with the right sort of policies that will encourage us to reduce fossil fuel reduction.  Now, one of the great bright spots we see--as Mr.Lipinski, my friend from Illinois, pointed out--is that there is a bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus that has been formed over the last two terms. In order to join, you have to have a Member of the other party. If I am a Democrat, I have a Member of the Republican Party join.  What we are doing in that caucus is creating legislation that will help reduce carbon emissions in an economic and prosperous way. I think good things have a potential to happen. I encourage the caucus to continue, and I hope it continues to grow.  ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374.txt,1781,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,1,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1049,topic-id,307,"Mr.Speaker, November is Prematurity Awareness Month, and I rise today to discuss the fight to prevent premature births.  I remember my very first night alone at Bayfront Medical Center as a second year OB/GYN resident when I was summoned to the labor and delivery unit at 2 in the morning. There, I found a young lady who never had prenatal care, who literally was bleeding to death as her placenta was tearing away from her uterus. As we rushed her back to the operating room, I did a quick sonogram to figure out if these babies were viable. Just glancing at her, she looked like she was 22 or 23 weeks along. I quickly saw that not only was there one baby in this uterus, but there were two babies. Though we got the babies out in less than 30 seconds, both of those babies perished from their extreme prematurity.  That has been 25 or 30 years ago, Mr.Speaker, and to this day prematurity is still the number one cause of death for infants. One out of ten babies are still born premature, and one out of three of those still die. Though we have done a great job in treating these premature babies, we have done very little to lower the incidence of premature births.  That is why I rise today: to recognize this problem, and to tell everyone that the most important step you can do to prevent premature birth is early prenatal care. That is why, wherever I have been, whether it was a residency in Petersburg, Florida, or delivering babies in Great Bend, Kansas, I made sure that every patient, regardless of their ability to pay, had early access to prenatal care early on in their pregnancy that hopefully identified the risk that might lead to premature birth.

301,topic-id,1720,"Mr.President, there are few things we do here in the Senate that matter more or have longer lasting impacts on our Nation than confirming individuals to lifetime appointments in district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme  It is the Senate's duty, as Alexander Hamilton laid out in the Federalist Papers, to ``prevent the appointment of unfit characters.'' Hamilton thought that this power would be used rarely because a President would seek to make sure that he or she sent qualified individuals to the Senate for confirmation, but we are seeing something quite different today. We are seeing the President engaged in a zeal to pack the court with extreme rightwing ideologues and to ram them through this confirmation process without due review.  Just yesterday, the American Bar Association sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee saying that Leonard Grasz, President Trump's nominee to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, is not qualified to serve as a Federal judge. Yet his confirmation hearing is scheduled for this week.  Putting extreme and unqualified people on the court is a disservice to America's judiciary. It will impact the protection of fundamental American rights for generations to come. It is critical for us, therefore, to have a conversation about what is going on at this moment.  Just this week, we have four nominees for the court of appeals coming to the floor. Amy Barrett was confirmed just hours ago. There is another vote scheduled for tomorrow. These individuals, as I will go through in a moment, don't come here with the types of qualifications that really should allow them to be considered for lifetime appointments.  Time and time again, we have heard from our Republican leadership that Democrats are engaged in a massive, ``often-mindless partisan obstruction,'' in the words of the majority leader. From where comes this evaluation? Well, he wants to move judiciary nominees faster, without due consideration. And certainly he does know something about obstructing judicial nominations since he spent the entire 8 years of the Obama administration leading the effort to obstruct consideration of nominees here in this  Eighty percent of President Obama's nominees waited 181 days or longer. That is certainly far more than under President George Bush, President Clinton, the first President Bush, or President Reagan--obstruction taken to the maximum, 6 months or longer to work their way through the confirmation process.  Throughout President Obama's entire 8 years in office, just 55 circuit court judges were confirmed. That is the lowest number for any And by this point in the previous administration--in the Obama administration--just one nominee had been confirmed for a spot on the circuit court. But here we are taking a look at how in this time period just one had been confirmed for Obama, but we will have, at the end of this week--assuming each individual gets the full majority--eight circuit court nominees confirmed. That is one for Obama and eight for President That number wasn't reached substantially into President Obama's second year in office.  We can look at the average number of days that it has taken from committee report to confirmation for the first seven nominees. President Trump's first seven circuit and district court nominees waited 37 days for confirmation once they were reported out of the Judiciary Let's compare that to President Obama, where the Judiciary Committee held them up for 75 days. So once again Democrats in the minority are moving far, far faster to date than did our colleagues when President Obama was in office. Certainly by comparison, President Trump's nominees are sailing through at a rapid pace.  So let's not hear any more about the preposterous false news coming from the majority side about things being slowed down when the facts are quite the opposite. But why this emphasis on[[Page S6915]]creating this false narrative? Perhaps it is because right now there is a lot of pressure on the majority to show that they are getting something done, and not much is happening that will help anyone in this country. They tried to get something done by trying to strip healthcare from 20 to 30 million Americans in 5 different versions of the TrumpCare monster. They didn't quite get it done, thankfully. And I doubt that the American people--in fact, I know that they certainly would not have been appreciative of the bill in which my Republican colleagues said: Let's strip all this healthcare away from 20 to 30 million people so we can give massive, multitrillion-dollar tax benefits, tax giveaways to the very richest  That is certainly not a way to win the hearts and minds of Americans--attack working Americans time after time in order to deliver the National Treasury to the very richest Perhaps my colleagues will be glad they didn't succeed in that effort.  Now there is a tax plan on the floor--a tax plan being considered that will once again take $1.5 trillion out of healthcare to deliver several trillion dollars to the richest 1 percent of We see it time and time again--attack working Americans to deliver incredible gifts from the National Treasury--really a raid on Fort Has ever such an audacious theft been considered previously in U.history than the theft that my colleagues are trying to perpetuate both through the healthcare strategy and now through this tax strategy?  But there is a bigger purpose at work here, and that is a goal to rewrite the vision of our Our Constitution has this incredibly powerful, meaningful vision of government of, by, and for the people, but my colleagues don't like that vision, and they decided that the best way to change it is to put people onto the court who like a different vision--government of, by, and for the privileged and the powerful. We saw it in their healthcare bill, we see it in their tax bill, and now we are seeing it in their nomination strategy to the court--a GOP agenda that will tip the scales of justice to favor the powerful and privileged over working Americans; judges who want to legislate from the bench on behalf of the powerful; judges who want to legislate from the bench on behalf of the privileged, who want to support predatory consumer practices, who want to strip away individual rights of women to determine their own healthcare, who want to deny a fair day in court by allowing binding arbitration where the seller of the services gets to pick and pay for the judge. Judges, rather than pursuing neutrality, are pursuing government for the powerful--that is the radical rightwing agenda attack on working  We should do all that we can to stop it, including having opposition in this                     Nomination of Stephanos Bibas  This week, we will have Stephanos Bibas, President Trump's nominee to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, who believes that overincarceration in our jails has nothing to do with race or with mandatory minimums despite all of the research and data that show otherwise.  He takes on and disagrees with the experts on medical care, who understand the fundamentals of addiction. He says, simply, though drug addiction is painted as a disease that requires medical intervention, all of that is unnecessary. Drug addicts can just stop using drugs. If only it were that easy. He has such a profound misunderstanding of the basic healthcare issue. Person after person after person on both sides of this aisle has come to say that opioid addiction is an addiction that needs medical treatment; yet he is a nominee who does not understand any of that.  He also believes that when it comes to legal sentences, corporal punishment should be applied that is ``public, shameful, and painful.'' Perhaps the understanding of rare and unusual punishment was something missing in his legal education.  Let's look at his 2 years as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York--the notable case of United States v. Williams, which the New York Times described at the time as a ``legal legend in the making.'' They did not say that because of its being a wise or insightful decision. He was working as a prosecutor, and he wanted to really go after the little guy.  He used his position to marshal prosecutorial, law enforcement, and court resources to bring charges against a cashier at a veterans hospital who had been accused of stealing $7--not $7,000, not $700,000, and not the $700 million or $1 billion being laundered by a big bank but the accusation of a cashier who had stolen $7. Stealing is never acceptable and never appropriate, but it did not matter that the cashier maintained that she had given the seven crinkled $1 bills that she had straightened out or that the security cameras did not show her pocketing them or that the customer who was right there saw it and stated that she was innocent. It did not matter. None of those facts mattered. He wanted to go after the little guy rather than go after the big folks who steal us blind.  The morning of the trial comes around, and a detective testifies that he found those seven $1 bills in the cash register, just as the customer had stated. Meanwhile, this nominee saw fit to spend huge amounts of Federal resources in going after an individual who, by every form of testimony, had not committed a crime in the first place. It is easy to go after the little people, and if you believe in government by and for the powerful and the privileged, as these nominees do, then that is your mission in life--to go after the little people. Yet she lost out because, even though she was innocent, she lost her job due to her prosecution.  Then there is Joan Larsen, who is the President's nominee for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, a nominee who was added at the last moment to another circuit court nominee's confirmation hearing, which was against the Senate's practices and against minority opposition. Why do you add someone at the last moment? It is to ensure that the committee does not have enough time to adequately review her record. That is always a cause for suspicion--someone is changing the procedure so that a person's record cannot be reviewed before the committee sits down to the hearing.

525,topic-id,2055,"Mr.President, our Nation was founded on a powerful principle encapsulated by the first three words of our Constitution: ``We the People.'' We are meant to be a nation, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, ``of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' not a nation by and for the most powerful, not a nation by and for the most privileged. Yet time and time again, we are seeing a complete and total corruption of the vision of our  We saw this earlier this year with one TrumpCare bill after another designed to rip healthcare away from 20 to 30 million Americans to deliver tax giveaways to the richest in We have seen it just recently in the consideration of a budget that reversed that and said that in order to give $4.5 trillion of tax giveaways almost entirely to the richest Americans, we will take $1 trillion out of Medicaid and half a trillion out of We have seen this powerful conversion of standing our Constitution on its head, and now we have the Supreme Court fully participating in this effort in a case called Janus v. It is the very epitome of the principle of a nation so corrupted that it honors the opposite of what our Constitution stands for.  The sole purpose of this case, Janus v. AFSCME, is to undercut the ability of workers to organize. This is an assault on the freedom of working Americans to associate with their coworkers. It is an assault on the freedom of working Americans to negotiate a fair wage. It is an assault on the freedom of Americans to fight for fairer benefits and a safe workplace. Bottom line: It is an assault on the freedom of workers to participate in the wealth they work so hard to create.  In short, this is the right to exploit that our Supreme Court--majority of five--is so determined to elevate. I have read the Constitution, and I have never seen embedded in it a right to exploit, a right to cheat, a right to take advantage of. Yet here is the majority of the Court prepared to fight for exploitation on behalf of the 1 percent of Americans at the very top.  The key strategy in this case is to attack the finances of workers when they organize. Former President Jimmy Carter once said: ``Every advance in this half-century--Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, aid to education, one after another--came with the support and leadership of American labor.'' It has been workers banding together to say: We can create a better foundation for families to thrive. And that hasn't just created a better foundation for those who belong to unions; it has created a better foundation for all workers. We saw them successfully band together and fight for a 40-hour workweek, fight for minimum wage, fight for sick leave, and fight for healthy and safe working conditions--again, benefits that every worker enjoys because workers were able to organize and fight to receive and win these provisions.  What is really going in the Janus case? Any organization, in order to function, has rights and responsibilities. Rights are the rewards you get for participating, and responsibilities are the requirement that you be part of the team and you contribute to the effort.  When I was small, probably just 2 or 3 years old, my mother had a book she would read to me that involved the animals in the barnyard. Animal after animal was asked to participate in making the bread, and animal after animal turned it down, but when the bread was baked, they wanted a full share even though they had refused to participate in the effort to create it. This is what Janus is all about. It is about the right to the rewards, divided from any responsibility to get the work done.  When workers organize, they say: We are going to have to be able to have the finances to drive this organization, and to do that, we need to have every worker contribute a fair share. Those fair share fees mean that all the workers[[Page S6961]]are in it together, they are all contributing, and they all benefit from the rewards.  Forever, the courts have said: Yes, with the reward goes the responsibility. That is true of any organization. It is fundamental in how organizations work. If you don't show up here on the floor, you don't get to vote. Every organization has its responsibilities that go with its rewards. But the 1 percent have chosen a strategy that says: We will take one organization in America--and that is workers organizations--and we will drive an absolute wedge between the responsibility and the reward.  These fees that we are talking about, these fair share fees, are not fees that go to political purposes. They don't go to donations to candidates. They don't go to organizing campaigns walking door-to-door for candidates. They don't go to advertising on the television or the web. They are simply the cost of having a team that works to negotiate an agreement with a company.  I find it absolutely evil that a majority of the Supreme Court is excited about embracing this right to exploit other workers by saying in this one case in America, you get the rewards without the responsibilities. If the Court was applying that to a stockholder in a company, the equivalent would be to say that the stockholder doesn't have to contribute to the costs of the management of the corporation, so they can demand back their share of what the management spends on their salaries, on their office spaces, on their private jets, and on their trips to do whatever they do, of the time they spend negotiating acquisitions to build the size of the company or striking deals to sell their products. That would be the equivalent, that a stockholder gets the rewards of all of that negotiation without having to participate in the cost. But this is not a situation in which five Justices want to apply consistent principle because their goal isn't to honor the Constitution, and their goal is not fairness; their single goal is to demolish the ability of workers to organize, to get a fair share of the wealth they work to create.  We can see that already our Nation is in trouble on this principle. For the three decades after World War II, we had workers who had the strong ability to organize and demand a fair share, and we saw a revolution in the prosperity of workers in those three decades from 1945 through 1975. Individuals who had lived in shacks, individuals who had been wiped out by the Great Depression suddenly were able to buy, on a single worker's income--it didn't even take two incomes--a three-bedroom ranch house with a basement and a single-car garage and were still able to save money for an annual camping trip and perhaps to save some to help their children launch themselves into life. That is what we had when workers got a fair share.  Yet, in the midseventies, the multinational companies said: Do you know what? Let's undercut the American worker by making our goods overseas in China and importing them. That way, we will demolish the jobs here in America, and we, the company, will have made things at the lowest price in the world, have sold them at the world market price, and have made a lot more money. This strategy worked for the multinational companies. They made vast sums of money for their stockholders and for their executives.  This application of different rules for foreign workers and domestic workers really gave a huge advantage to our competitor overseas and to a company that spanned both shores and could move its production overseas. So we saw the loss of 50,000 factories; we saw the loss of 5 million factory jobs; we saw the loss of an enormous number of supply chain jobs; and we saw, without those payrolls being spent in the community, an enormous loss of retail jobs in the community, but it made the wealthy wealthier, and that was the goal of the strategy.  So here we are, facing this case that will come before the Court later this year, but the members of the Court have, essentially, already declared their positions. Four members of the Court were on the previous version of this when the Court tied 4 to 4, and Neil Gorsuch, who was added to the Court, has been very clear on which side of this he stands.  Should we put an asterisk by Neil Gorsuch's name? Should a 5-to-4 decision, with Gorsuch being in the majority, even carry weight here in our society? This is the seat that for the first time in U.history was stolen from one President and delivered to another. The majority of this body right here stole the seat, undermining the integrity, dishonoring the oath, the responsibility for advice and consent, and damaging the legitimacy of the Supreme It was done because it was a strategy to enable the 1 percent to rip off ordinary working The prize for that was a position on Citizens United that now allows the wealthiest Americans to continue to fund campaigns across this country to drown out the voices of ordinary people and a position on this case, the Janus case, that says that we will take one organization in America, that of the workers, and divide the rewards from the rights.  We know who is behind this strategy. It is the Koch brothers through their organizations, the National Right to Work Foundation and the Liberty Justice They were behind the strategy for the theft of the Supreme Court seat. They were behind the massive increase in third-party spending that polluted the campaigns across this country. They are behind this strategy to destroy the vision that is embedded in our  Eleanor Roosevelt once said: I am opposed to this legislation because it gives employers the right to exploit.

The right to exploit is not a right that any Member of this body should pursue, and it certainly should not be pursued by the Supreme  We know that there is a chapter 2 to this strategy. The first is to get the Supreme Court so that you can divide the rights from the responsibilities; therefore, you as a worker do not have to contribute to the cost, but you will benefit from the rewards. Pretty soon, very few people will be contributing; therefore, it will undermine the financial ability of the union to negotiate.  Then they have a second strategy. This fundraising letter was sent out last year by the State Policy By the way, the State Policy Network is an alliance of 66 State-based think tanks that are designed and funded by the Koch brothers and their friends to undercut the ability of workers to get a fair share of the wealth that they create. They said: Here is our plan to defund and defang our opponent, the unions--to deal a blow to the left's ability to control government.  Ah, they are fancy words, but what they really meant was our goal is to take and undo the ability of workers to organize so as to get a fair share of the wealth they create. It is one evil act after another that is funded by the Koch cartel.  In our Nation, we have stood up to this type of abuse time and again. The American historian who created the phrase the ``American dream'' said, in each generation, there is a group of Americans who rises up to take on the forces that appear to be overwhelming us. We need to call on the people of the United States who believe in the vision of our Constitution, to be that group to rise up and take on this effort to turn our Constitution on its head--to strip ``we the people'' out of our Constitution and replace it with ``we the powerful''--and to stand up against this type of right to exploit, whether it is a bill here on the floor of the U.Senate or it is a begotten majority of the Supreme  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945.txt,1900,CLOTURE MOTION,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

349,topic-id,2356,"Mr.Speaker, today is the early action deadline for many colleges in the United Thousands of students who are submitting their applications are anxiously hoping for entry into a college, community college, or postsecondary school.  As students try to determine what schools are right for them, it is clear they are missing some key information--information we all wish we had for our children: How likely are they to graduate? How long will it take to earn a degree or their certificate? How likely are they to find a job? How much money will they earn if they do find a job?  As a parent, I know this information will be helpful. That is why I introduced the College Transparency My legislation would utilize and make meaning out of the data we currently gather at the Federal level to enable students and parents to make informed decisions.  I have over 35 years in workforce development and postsecondary education. I understand the difficulties that people have in making informed decisions about what is best for their future career. I also understand the reporting expectations for career colleges and universities. I understand which institutions have the information available and how they provide it. I also understand the burdens that occur in providing that information.  Despite the incredible investment involved and the risk in pursuing a postsecondary education, we and students are left with too little information to answer the most basic questions: What can students expect to pay out of pocket? Can you imagine that really they cannot determine how much it will cost them to complete a postsecondary program? How do students fare in the labor market after leaving college? How likely are they to fare in order to enter into the labor market? How do students fare on other metrics of success we all consider important, like earnings, and loan repayment?  A prospective student doesn't have the information about which programs at which institutions provide an adequate return on their investment, and on their parents' investment.  As a consumer and a father, it is difficult for me to wrap my head around the idea that Americans have so little information about potentially what may be the largest investment they make in their lives, and certainly, the second largest. I am the father of six children. The reality is that we are investing and putting six children through a college or a postsecondary program. Think about how much money goes into that. Yet we operate in a vacuum on information.  When you shop online, you are able to compare products, you are able to compare costs, you are able to compare features, the value to the consumer. At this point in time, try to do that about programs at a college, university, or career school. Try to compare one university's nursing program to another; or the architecture program, or history program, or the nursing program in a college. Try to find that information. You won't find it online. Try to call the university. Good luck on that.  It is not that they don't try to provide it. In fact, they provide reams of data. The reality is that the current system simply doesn't gather that data in a manner that is useful to consumers, the people that ultimately pay the bill.  The College Transparency Act would enable students to answer crucial questions, such as how likely they are to enter the workforce successfully, or what their chances are of transferring from a community college to a 4-year college and being able to graduate.  Students past and present are owners of the $1.4 trillion outstanding Federal debt, and the clock is ticking. It is time for students, families, and guidance counselors involved in the college decisionmaking process to be able to assist students and have access to information that will make this huge investment make sense. Otherwise, we leave young people to make decisions based on: Well, those colors on the band uniform are really cool; or they have a good football team; or it seems like they have a really nice social life.  But, ultimately, what we are making is an investment into the future of our children and the future of this country. They have massive money invested, and let's be honest, we all do as taxpayers as well. We have a huge investment in the preparation of young people for the workforce.  It is time to streamline and update our higher education information system so that families and students can make better decisions on their path to long-term success. It is time to utilize and make meaning out of the data we currently collect to assist them in making the choice.                              {time}  1915  The question I am asked is: Why did I submit the College Transparency Act? I spent 35 years operating a private career school group and working in workforce development. I worked at Chrysler Corporation, moved to another company, and also retired out of that field.  The point is, I have worked in the field for 35 years. I understand the data that is reported. I understand the challenges that people have in trying to sort out what is the best career path for them, how likely are they to succeed in that career path, and what is it going to cost to go to school?[[Page H8370]]  This information all exists--and we will talk about that tonight--but it isn't made available in some coherent manner to students, and we need to fix that.  We also can't tell students how long, on average, it takes them to complete their program. It used to be the day where they used to call them 4-year colleges. The reality, as you well know, Mr.Speaker, is 4-year colleges are now a dream, 5 years is the norm, and 6 years is not uncommon, yet we don't talk about the cost it takes to do that. Again, we don't talk about the likelihood of completing even if you attend 6 years. The reality is we have to fix that.  In my 35 years of dealing with the system, what became clear to me is it is outdated, it is burdensome, it is unhelpful, and it conflicts. It led me to start working on the College Transparency Act as soon as I came to It was the first bill that I dropped and submitted in It is the one I spent the most time on. Why? Because we have a huge investment in postsecondary education, and, even more importantly, we have a huge investment preparing a labor force.  I have not gone to an employer since I was sworn into office that has not said to me: We can't find people with the skills to go to work.  Yet we have people who have graduated from college who can't find jobs that relate to their degree. We have people who will go to college for an extended period of time or to a postsecondary program who don't complete, but they meander their way through. They get lost. They don't have the information to make an informed decision, and then somehow, sometimes, frankly, we blame the consumer.  It is our fault. It is our fault here. It is our fault at the Federal We are making a huge investment, and we expect everybody else to cure the problem. Better information on outcomes in student success will certainly assist in closing the skills gap that we talk about nearly every day here in Congress and certainly every day in the Education and the Workforce Committee when we meet.  Senators Hatch, Warren, Cassidy, and Whitehouse share my concern. On the Senate side, they have introduced a similar bill--almost identical--to address this critical issue. I believe on this issue we can get bipartisan support to move forward with an approach to inform the public and the consumers about the decision they will make with their money and, to be honest with you, our investment in their future.  The current system is massively broken. This chart will show the current reporting system for higher education in the United States today. If you can possibly read it from there--and we will get it submitted for the Record--these are all the groups that gather data, all the places it goes, and all the information that is exchanged about students going to postsecondary education in the United  I ask you, Mr.Speaker, can you make any sense of that? I have worked 35 years in that field. I will tell you that a student enrollment for one system doesn't match the definition of enrollment in another system, it doesn't match the definition in the State system, yet we all report that information. Graduate information is all different depending on the system. None of the definitions match.  Now, if we can't get definitions to match internally in a system between State accrediting agencies and the Federal Government, how is it we expect students and how are parents to understand whether they are likely to complete the program? And, by the way, none of this information adequately reports student outcomes in terms of employment and doesn't provide them any information on what they are likely to earn. And guess what? Earnings matter in terms of their ability to pay their student loans back. News flash to everybody: it helps if they know what they are going to make.  A 2015 study completed by Boston Consulting Group indicated $11.1 billion is spent by institutions to comply with regulations specific to colleges and universities. We don't need more regulations. Good God, help us. We have plenty--we have plenty of reporting.  One of the most significant findings of the study was that small and medium colleges are disproportionately impacted by those Federal regulations with compliance eating up a much larger share of expenditures than the wealthier institutions.  While we say we need more options for continuing and postsecondary education, for career and technical education at the postsecondary level, we are killing those institutions with rules and regulations of reporting that give us that, that isn't useful to the public that has to make a decision. Imagine that.  We have an opportunity to fix that with the Higher Education We have an opportunity to fix that with the College Transparency We have an opportunity now.  There are three main goals of the bill. This chart will show you what the bill will collect. First and most importantly, the goal is to provide accurate and complete information that is searchable for students and can be customized. Think about it. How many people have shopped for an automobile? They have on the website a comparison of whatever vehicle to other similar vehicles sold by other manufacturers. You can compare them dealer to dealer. You can get an idea what features are there. Shop for whatever you want, and then tell me if you can find that about any educational program offered by postsecondary institutions.  This addresses that issue while reducing reporting burdens on institutions. I believe, and I think most of our party believes, that market competition works best when consumers can actually find out information and make rational decisions. They can compare complete information. They can compare the offerings, the costs, and the outcomes.  With that competition, we can, in fact, address one of the other concerns we have, which is: What is the cost of higher education? We can compare it not just on what you pay for tuition, room and board, but the return on investment. What do they get for their time and money in a postsecondary education program?  More importantly, choices will be made by consumers and not the Federal We have seen how that works in so many ways, and the Federal Government should not be making choices about the future of  If we arm consumers with that information to make informed decisions, then we can remove the Federal Government from the business of determining quality in education and let consumers and accrediting agencies address that.  The bill also replaces a number of reporting requirements that the Federal Government has, most notably what is called the IPED survey. I did them for years. Routinely, we get questions that don't match their definitions because their definitions made no sense for many institutions.  Thirdly, the bill aims to provide transparency to its students by requiring they be posted in a searchable database, and the costs would be identified there.  Let me go through real quickly in that chart the information that will be available that is not currently available on a searchable basis. You can get enrollment patterns, you can get progress to completion, and you can get completion rates. Do you graduate from a program? Imagine that. You can find that out, and it is the same definition whether it is the University of Michigan or Michigan State where I attended. Wouldn't that be a great idea?  You can find out about their postcollege earnings. It is really helpful. Most people go to college or a postsecondary school to find a job, earn some money, and support their family. Can they do that? What is likely to be the outcome?  The cost of the program? I mentioned that a couple of times. It is not just tuition and room and board. The reality is that, depending on the program, your costs are significantly different. My 18- almost 19-year-old stepdaughter attends an art school. Well, beyond tuition and room and board, there are huge costs for art supplies. Now, we knew that. I have experience in education. There are a lot of people who start these programs who don't understand there are other costs and what those may be. This process requires reporting of that from the colleges.  Also, information about financial aid that is available for those institutions[[Page H8371]]so they can compare program to program, institution to institution, and make a decision that is best for them and their family. That is what we are trying to achieve here. It is achievable.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Garrett) who will speak for a few moments on the bill and its advantages.

354,topic-id,869,"I appreciate the gentleman's notation of the groups that support this bill. I was surprised, frankly, with the number of groups that stepped forward--as I said, over 90--to support the College Transparency Some of the groups I would like to stress today include veterans groups.  The Student Veterans of America and Veterans Education Success, among others, have endorsed the bill because it helps veterans determine which institutions and programs best serve their unique needs and improve their ability to make progress in the workforce to be successful, something that, frankly, we owe them as part of their service to our country.  As Chris Cate, vice president of research at Student Veterans of America, said: ``Based on recent research, the value of the Post-9/11 GI Bill is clear, as student veterans across the country succeed at rates higher than traditional students. Yet, determining these outcomes is currently a significant effort and not easily accomplished without abundant resources. Basing policy on research and data is imperative, and it shouldn't take as much effort as it does today, as we have the answer to this challenge staring us in the face.'' It is the College Transparency  We currently collect the data that people are begging to get to make informed decisions for themselves and, frankly, in this case, to assist veterans in making wise decisions on their GI bill.  Let me talk a little more about some of the groups that support the bill, and then I will yield to another colleague of mine.  Colleges, universities, and postsecondary institutions support this bill, which sometimes surprises me, given what we are trying to do, which is remake a reporting system and make transparent their performance. Think about it. They support the bill without exception. These institutions want more comprehensive information on student progress, completion, and outcomes so they can better understand and evaluate how well they are serving their students and identify areas for improvement.  Institutions also know best student-level data collection will decrease the reporting burden and the financial and human resources necessary to report and complete the requirements of the Federal Government, State government, and accrediting agencies.  Associations representing institutions serving the majority of college students support lifting the ban on connecting student-level data to help build evidence and improve the quality of the program.  As my colleague Mr.Stivers indicated, as well as others, this information is disseminated and developed only at the metadata level. It is not like we are going to send your Social Security number out and post it on a Facebook page with your employment status; although, in your case, Mr.Speaker, everyone knows well your employment status.  According to the Michigan Association of State Universities, which serves as the coordinating board for Michigan's 15 public universities in my home State: ``The College Transparency Act of 2017 represents a much-needed modernization of the Federal Government's college reporting system for postsecondary data. The current ban on student-level data in the Higher Education Act represents a gross injustice to students and families who require and deserve more accurate data on postsecondary institutional outcomes in order to be adequately equipped to make one of the most important decision in one's life--whether and where to attend college. By providing more accurate information about institutional graduation rates, salary levels, and other employment outcomes, and additional information on how students fare at individual institutions and in academic programs, the College Transparency Act will enable the creation of an essential resource for student and consumer information.''  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Michigan Association of State                                           Michigan Association of                                           State Universities,                                       Lansing, MI, July 10, 2017.     Re Endorsement of College Transparency Act, H.2434/         1121.     Paul Mitchell,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Mitchell: On behalf of the presidents and      chancellors of the 15 public universities of Michigan and the      nearly 300,000 students they collectively enroll, I write to      express strong support for the College Transparency Act of      2017, H.2434, which you have sponsored, and its companion      bill in the Senate, 1121.       The College Transparency Act of 2017 represents a much      needed modernization of the federal government's college      reporting system for postsecondary data. The current ban on      student-level data in the Higher Education Act represents a      gross injustice to students and families who require and      deserve more accurate data on postsecondary institutional      outcomes in order to be adequately equipped to make one of      the most important decision in one's life--whether and where      to attend college. By providing more accurate information      about institutional graduation rates, salary levels and other      employment outcomes, and additional information on how      students fare at individual institutions and in academic      programs, the College Transparency Act will enable the      creation of an essential resource for student and consumer      information.       Introduced in both Congressional chambers, this bipartisan      legislation will also serve as an indispensable tool in      helping institutions assess and enhance their academic      programs. Michigan public universities rely heavily on data      to inform institutional policy and to better serve our      students.       We commend your leadership and those co-sponsoring the      College Transparency Act and offer our support in advocating      passage of the legislation. America's students, families,      taxpayers and postsecondary institutions will all benefit      greatly from its enactment.

357,topic-id,1897,"I thank my colleague, Mr.Smucker, for taking time out of his busy schedule to come here tonight to talk about the act and its importance nationally and in his district.  He made reference to something I wish to stress, Mr.Speaker, which is that, annually, at the Federal level, we spend $160 billion a year on student aid. We currently spend it into a vacuum, into a giant black hole, in which we hope we get outcomes and which students hope they get outcomes. Certainly, parents hope they get outcomes so they don't continue to live at home. We all hope that we can get success for our young people, and we don't have the information to determine that.  Let me also stress that, beyond educational groups, veterans, the U.Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have both endorsed this bill as being critical to the success of our Nation going forward.  I want to stress for you and everyone in this Chamber, when you get the level of support from such a broad range of people, we have to start asking ourselves: Why have we not already moved on this? Why has it not already taken place? We need to move on this issue sooner rather than later. We can't afford not to.  Let me talk about one other group that supports this bill passionately. Students want to know which schools are best fit for their needs. Deciding where to spend their time, their precious dollars, and incur debt is critically important to them.  Surprisingly enough, these folks want to do more than go to college, meet new friends, and have a little party every now and then. The vast majority--85 percent--of college freshmen rate getting a better job as very important in their decision to go to college; yet the day-to-day need, as we have talked about repeatedly tonight, to discern which program's institutions will best address that objective is lacking.  The ability to provide that information is at our hands. We have the technology. We have the data. We just don't provide it in a usable format.  Groups that support this bill include the Big Ten Student Association, Campaign for College Opportunity, Young Invincibles, Institute for College Access and Success, the United Negro College Fund, Achieving the Dream, Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education, Institute for Higher Education Policy, and the National Association for College Admission They support the College Transparency  I would ask: How many more groups do we need to gather before we decide to act here in Congress?                              {time}  1945  In the time I have left, I want to address some myths. And if my colleague, Mr.Smucker, who is still here, wants to weigh in on this, I invite him to join at any point in time he wants to weigh in, because we heard a number of myths put forward about the terrible things that the College Transparency Act may arise.  One that amazes me is that while the bill requires institutions collect and report tons of new information on students--well, can we bring that chart back up of what we already collect? Let's look at that gem of what we collect currently. We are doing this now. Institutions are doing this now.  So tell me, how are we going to collect tons more? In fact, every student who attends a postsecondary education institution in the United States has information reported on them now, whether they take student financial aid or not, because a 1098-T is filed by that institution with the IRS so, in fact, if they claim credit for going to school, tuition tax credit, they can claim that.  There is no information that is not currently with one agency or another. The astonishing thing is the discussion that somehow there is some secret about whether someone is attending a postsecondary institution. It is astonishing.  College universities, also, because of this reporting, hold the student-level data. They report much of it to the Department of Education, to NCES, and to the State Department of Education to accredit the agencies in a variety of formats. The number of formats, the array of those, will totally amaze you. If you would like, I can get those reports for you. You can spend the afternoon looking through the joys of reporting on educational activities in a postsecondary institution, and none of it makes any sense to anybody that isn't actually in the system, and I will admit, that data doesn't make any sense to me either.  Colleges and universities also don't know if their graduates actually get a job, unless half the students come back happily and say they went to work and how much they are making. They don't get that information. They couldn't assist the student with that information if they tried in any accurate basis other than anecdotally. So they don't try. Why would you? You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't make that mistake.  That information exists. Why? Because the IRS has a 1098-T on everyone who went to college or a postsecondary institution. That data can be matched by the Treasury Department to whether that student is employed, what they are making, and they can report that, as was noted earlier, through metadata to the Department of Education for development of reports without reporting one individual student's information.[[Page H8374]]  So I am lost in understanding how it is we lose our minds around here about student information being disseminated. It exists. It can be protected.  Let me talk real briefly about another myth that exists, that somehow tracking the student data will lead to a Federal rating system, the Federal rating system of educational programs of institutions.  Well, first, the Department of Education has tried a number of rating systems over there, all with mixed success, at best, and I am trying to be polite. It is late in the evening. Let's not be too blunt. But they failed miserably in doing so. They tried to rate institutions based on cohort default rates, and those are being repealed by many as being inaccurate.  They tried to rate institutions on something called gainful employment, but they only do gainful employment for career schools, because, hey, you know, no one goes to a university for gainful employment. I assure you, my guess is the Speaker did as well, you went to the university hoping for gainful employment. I doubt there is anyone in the room who didn't go to a college or university in hopes of gainful employment.  The reality is the Department of Education, as they have implemented this, has tried to create these Federal rating systems and failed miserably. So I tell you what, we did something unique. The College Transparency Act explicitly prohibits the creation of a single database by the Department of Education and expressly prohibits using that database for a Federal rating system.  I give up. I don't want the Department of Education telling us what a good education system is because look how well they have done so far. We will let consumers decide. We will give them information so they can decide. They can make a wise decision rather than thinking that Big Brother can make that decision for them.  If the government were doing so well with it, why is it that every Member in this room has heard from their employers the terrible shortage we have of people in current technical education, of workers? If they were doing such a great job of ratings and informing people what their opportunities were, why are we currently struggling with the workforce we have?  It is a disaster. Let's stop thinking we can fix it, and let's let consumers have the information they need to fix it.  The bill enables the NCES to aggregate student information from relevant agencies with the responsibility that they had to protect that data, which they have done for years.  So now they are doing--not create some massive Federal database in which everybody's name, Social Security number, is accessible so we can determine whether or not you are a successful student. It doesn't do that, not even close to that, never has. It provides information on an accurate basis by a program institution of what your likelihood of success is.  Last but not least, I talked a little bit about it, is keeping personal information private, the fears about privacy, and that somehow we can't achieve that under the College Transparency  The College Transparency Act requires that data collection should be led by the National Center for Education I apologize. I have been using the abbreviation NCES because it has been burned into my memory over the years. It is a statistical agency with strong protocols for securing data and protecting student privacy. It has an excellent track record for doing so.  They have consulted with the private sector, pretty good folks, about how to continue to work on student privacy in that data. NCES is already required by law to develop and enforce standards to protect individual level data. As added protection, the act requires, the College Transparency Act requires, an institute utilize the latest Federal data security standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and We require that they implement those on an ongoing basis and they maintain those.  I have to tell you, Mr.Speaker, that is not commonplace in the Federal Government at this point. We are going a step beyond what happens every day in many agencies.  Further, your personal information, Mr.Smucker's or anybody else's, will never be available to the Department of Education or to the public. Your employment status will never be available. What will be available is whether all of us who took a program in Michigan State University--come on up, you would love the school, some time--whether or not you graduated, you got a job, and whether you are gainfully employed and making money. Now, wouldn't that be a great idea for the money you put into a college education? All the aggregate information is available on the programs and institutions we are talking about here.  The data developed by the Treasury Department on income and employment, once it is transmitted to NCES, is literally blown up. The file no longer exists. You can't hack what isn't there.  So I would ask, at this point in time, rather than continue to extol the virtues of the College Transparency Act, I would ask all the Members to look at the act. We have a number of cosponsors at this point in time that I am very proud of. It is a bipartisan bill. I would ask them to look at the act, look at what it is achieving, and if they have questions, let's hear those questions, and let's make an effort to move this forward.  We are already well into the decisionmaking process for young people to go to a postsecondary education program next year. It is too late for them to get this information, but, you know what, we can get it the following year. And the question I would ask is: How long are we going to wait while we are spending $160 billion in direct student aid alone hoping to get an outcome when we can do better and the ability to do that is at our fingertips?  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2.txt,1E+14,FTO PASSPORT REVOCATION ACT OF 2017,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1031,topic-id,547,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today under the ``E Pluribus Unum'' to give voice to the elderly, the children, the disabled, the most vulnerable who are once again facing your proposal, Mr.Speaker, to rip healthcare and the safety net from them.  Is this the best you can do, Mr.Speaker, to once again, over and over again, propose this legislation to cut trillions of dollars from Medicaid and Medicare to fund tax cuts for corporations and for billionaires, and to do this, to slam this through the House without transparency?  Mr.Speaker, Republicans like to call me a ``tax and spend liberal,'' but today we see this GOP fiscal plan as another ``borrow and spend to pay for billionaires tax cuts.''  Now, the Wharton School and the Goldman Sachs studies both show that, at best, this plan would produce a paltry one-tenth, maybe two-tenths of 1 percent growth, but we all know that it will increase the national debt by trillions of dollars.  This is a horrible investment, a horrible return, a negative return on investment. It is a terrible process. This is terrible legislation. It will produce terrible results for the overwhelming majority of Americans, especially the millions who rely on Medicaid and  Now, here is the deal, Mr.Speaker, that you are trying to push: if Americans are willing to give billionaires[[Page H8300]]windfall tax cuts today and also trade their health security and safety net, then you, Mr.Speaker, will give average Americans the empty promise of wage growth tomorrow and you will be able to file your taxes on a postcard.  I say ``empty promises'' because studies and our experience have shown that this unicorn of wage growth from tax cuts will never, in fact, happen. It is reminiscent, Mr.Speaker, of the gluttonous Wimpy in the ``Popeye'' cartoon: ``I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.''  Now, this is a great plan if you are rich. It is dollars for fool's gold, but the American people are not fools, Mr.Speaker, and that is why the Republicans want to rush this through with minimum transparency.  This is madness. Trickle down has not worked, it does not work, and it will never work. We have got deficits under Reagan and under George Bush to prove it.  The tax cuts will not pay for themselves, Mr.The tax cuts won't magically produce increased salaries for workers. The tax plan will not lead to these claims of economic growth.  Mr.Speaker, we have all lived long enough to know that these are all lies. It is not even wishful thinking anymore, because we know better.  Congress should not be considering tax cuts for the rich and opening up even more tax loopholes. Mr.Speaker, we cannot spin gold out of straw, and that is what we have here.  This plan will make most Americans poorer and sicker, if not dead. I urge all my colleagues to reject this bill.  Instead, Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to fortify our election system from Russian further interference; build new infrastructure, that is what creates jobs; fund the Child Health Insurance Program that Republicans let expire; ensure that all 3\1/2\ million American citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands can have access to water, power, and healthcare this holiday season.

1004,topic-id,1969,"Mr.President, last week, we voted on a judge who felt it necessary to sign up for a lifetime membership with a political organization in order to get his nomination forwarded back before this body.  The judge we voted on last week became a lifetime member of the NRA in between his appointment by President Obama and, then, his appointment by President Trump--a signal, apparently, to the new Republican White House that he would align with their interests and views on issues related to the regulation of firearms in this country.  We are going to see a parade of very interesting choices for the Federal judiciary come through this body, and they are going to be moved in rapid succession, as they are this week. I have been told that never before have we taken four votes on appellate nominees in a single week. Of course, that stands in contrast with the Republican Senate that refused to give even a hearing to one Supreme Court Justice over the entirety of 2016. I think it is worth noting that this body can move fast when it wants to, and yet we watched a Supreme Court seat be stolen by this Senate from a Democratic President who, by constitutional right, had the ability to make that appointment.  I bring up the lifetime membership in the NRA because it is increasingly clear that you have to signal a level of extremism on issues like firearms in order to get your name brought before this body. That signal is wildly out of step with where the American public is on many of these issues.  I have come to the floor over the course of the last 4 years every few weeks in order to talk about the fact that there is no other country in the world where 80 to 90 people every single day die from guns. The numbers are just absolutely stunning. Some 2,800 people a month die from guns, and 33,000 a year. The majority of those are suicides, but there are record numbers of homicides and accidental shootings in this country. Americans by and large don't accept this rate of slaughter. Americans want us to change our laws, and they don't want a judiciary that is going to stand in the way of Congress's ability to follow the wishes of our constituents.  I have been coming down to the floor to tell the story of the victims. My hope is that, although the data hasn't moved this Congress--90 percent of Americans want stronger gun laws--the data incontrovertibly shows that in places that have universal background checks or laws requiring you to get local permits before you buy a gun, there are less gun crimes.  Maybe if the data doesn't move my colleagues, the story of the victims will. Deon Rodney was shot on October 14 of this year, just a few weeks ago. He was working at Just Right Cutz, where he was a barber, in Bridgeport, He was the 22nd homicide victim in Bridgeport this year.  He had just finished cutting a young boy's hair in a chair when a masked gunman chased somebody else into the barbershop. Police said Deon was protecting the young boy, shielding the young boy from this intruder who came running in. He jumped out of his chair to try to get in between the boy sitting in the barber's chair and the gunman, and the gunman shot him.  The owner of the barber shop said:       Deon had just finished his haircut and the boy was getting      ready to go outside when the gunman came in. He saved      everyone in the barbershop.  Deon was 31 years old. He left behind his wife, his mother, plenty of other family members, and an 8-year-old daughter.  Speaking about their daughter, Deon's wife said:       He loved her endlessly, unconditionally.  His mother said:       Deon is a part of me. He was my son, but he was also my      friend.  His cousin said:       I know that everyone is recognizing his heroism now, but he      was always like this. Always a role model and always willing      to give. Always willing to go out of his way to help a      stranger. Nothing has changed all these years. I guess I'm      glad that the masses can now see this.  The owner of the barbershop went on to say of Deon:       He's dead because of these people running around with guns.  There are guns everywhere you look in cities like Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford, New York or People say: Why is that? Why are there all these guns--many of them, if not most of them, illegal guns--if you have strong gun laws in places like New York, Illinois, and Connecticut? The reason is that gun trafficking doesn't recognize State boundaries, and the guns used to commit crimes in places like Connecticut come from outside of  A comprehensive, groundbreaking survey of gun crimes in New York City found that 75 percent of the guns that are used to commit crimes in New York City come from outside of New York They come from States with looser gun laws, where you as a criminal can easily buy a gun without having to prove you are a responsible gun owner.  How do all these illegal guns get into Bridgeport such that somebody can turn a corner and walk into a barbershop with a weapon in their hand? It is because criminals with criminal records go into gun shows in States that don't require background checks at those forums, buy up dozens of weapons, load them into their cars, and then drive up to States with tougher gun laws and sell them on the black market.  Congress willingly allows this to happen because we have not moved our mandatory system of background checks to the places in which gun purchases are made today. Data is a little bit hard to pin down, but anywhere from 25 to 40 percent of gun sales today don't involve a background check. You can understand why. Sales have migrated to online. They have migrated to gun shows. They have gone to places where background checks aren't required.  I mentioned what the data tells us when it comes to background checks. The data tells us background checks save lives. Here is one slice of the data. In States that have universal background check laws, 47 percent fewer women get shot by an intimate partner than States without universal background check laws. That is because, in the heat of passion, domestic abusers often go to get a weapon and use it to perpetuate a domestic violence crime. You can't do that if you have a domestic violence history in a State with a universal background check law because wherever you go, you are going to be prohibited from buying that weapon.  Since November of 1998, more than 2.4 million gun sales to prohibited purchasers have been prevented because of background checks; 2\1/2\ million people who were criminals or who were addicts or who were seriously mentally ill were stopped from buying guns because of our background check laws. Because we now have at least one-quarter of all sales happening without background checks, that means there are hundreds of thousands of criminals,[[Page S6892]]hundreds of thousands of people with serious mental illness who are able to buy guns. It is not surprising that 90 percent of Americans, 90 percent of gun owners, 90 percent of Democrats, and 90 percent of Republicans support expanded background checks.  I would argue there is not another issue out there in American politics today that enjoys 90 percent support amongst Republicans and Senator Durbin corrected me the other day and said the latest survey states that the number is actually 94 percent support from Republicans and The only slice of the American electorate that you can get under 90 percent support of background checks is NRA members. NRA members support universal background checks at a 75-percent clip. Background checks save lives, they are supported by the vast majority of the American public, and yet we can't get it done.  This month, I, along with a couple dozen cosponsors, introduced a new version of legislation allowing for background checks to occur in every commercial sale that is conducted in this country, with commonsense exceptions, making sure that when you are gifting a firearm to a family member or you are loaning a gun to a friend who wants to take it to go hunting, you don't have to conduct a background check under those circumstances, but if it is a traditional arm's-length sale, then you have to go through a process, which normally takes 10 minutes in order to prove you are not a criminal. Again, this proposal is supported by 90 percent of It is time we recognize that it is directly connected to this epidemic of gun violence that plagues the country.  Let me close by making another argument to you. I know a lot of my Republican friends talk a lot on this floor and on the cable news shows about the threat of terrorism to this country. When the terrorists decided to use planes as their weapon of choice to attack our country, we changed the way our law protects us from attacks by airplanes. We made sure we screened individuals before they got on these planes to make sure they don't have weapons or bomb-making material that could ultimately threaten the rest of us. We now all take off our shoes every time we get on an airplane because we recognized that we needed to change our laws to understand that these planes were being used to attack American citizens.  These terrorist groups have recognized that it is now pretty hard to get somebody with a weapon or an explosive device on a plane so they are now directing would-be attackers to a different forum. An issue of Rumiyah, which is Isis's propaganda magazine, encouraged recruits in the United States to take advantage of our loose gun laws. It specifically told people go to gun shows where you will not have to present identification or submit to background checks in order to buy military-style weapons that you can use to kill dozens of ISIS and al-Qaida are telling their potential recruits in the United States to go to gun shows so they don't have to submit themselves to a background check and so there is no paper trail of the gun they are buying in order to kill  Why wouldn't we adjust our laws to recognize that the new weapon of choice of terrorists is not an airplane, but it is today a tactical weapon bought outside of the background check system. I have a million more reasons why we should do what 90 percent of the American people want, and someday maybe we will get there.  So 33,000 people a year, 2,800 a month, 93 a day--that is a rate of gun violence that is not twice that of other industrialized nations. It is not 5 times, it is not 10 times, it is 20 times higher than the rate of gun violence in other industrialized countries in this world. It is not because we have more people who are mentally ill, and it is not because we spend less money on law enforcement. It is, by and large, because we have a set of gun laws that allow for illegal guns, dangerous weapons to flow into the hands of very dangerous people.  I hope my Republican colleagues will take a look at the new background checks legislation I have introduced with many of my colleagues, and we can finally get to a place that 90 percent of our constituents want us to be.

512,topic-id,380,"Mr.President, I want to thank my colleague Senator Brown for leading the effort on the floor to speak out against the latest attacks on union rights that are in front of the Supreme Court right now. I am very proud to join him to highlight the contributions unions have made to our middle class, to the economy, and to our country. I want to express my commitment to stand up against any attempts to undermine workers' rights to join a union and bargain collectively.[[Page S6955]]  Since day one, President Trump has broken his campaign promise, which was to put our workers first, by rolling back worker protections and putting corporations and billionaires ahead of our working families, and now we are seeing corporate special interests doubling down on their attempts to undermine the rights of workers to band together. So it is critical now more than ever that we are committed to protecting our workers and their ability to advocate for safe working conditions, better wages, and a secure retirement.  Unions helped create the middle class in this country and helped a lot of our families in the last century become financially secure. But over the last few decades, as workers' bargaining power and union density have declined, we as a country have seen a decline in the middle class and a rise in income inequality in this country. As we all know, too many families today are struggling to make ends meet. Meanwhile, corporations' profits are at an alltime high.  I will continue to fight back against any attempts by this administration and by special interests to rig the rules against the people who go to work every day. I will keep fighting for policies that will help families save just a little more in their bank account, whether it includes raising the minimum wage or fighting for equal pay for equal work or strengthening our workers' rights to seek out and join a union and bargain collectively.

589,topic-id,1178,"Mr.President, since day one, the President of the United States has made it clear that his top priority, when it comes to healthcare in our country, is to score political points by attacking He has even said repeatedly that healthcare in our country will ``implode,'' but this was not just a prediction that President Trump made, it was his goal, and he has tried virtually everything he can do to make that implosion a reality.  In January, he abruptly pulled funding for outreach days before the end of the 2017 open enrollment period without any analysis of how that might affect patients and families, and he signed executive orders specifically designed to inject uncertainty and increased costs into the healthcare system.  President Trump then dedicated the spring and summer to attempting to jam partisan, extraordinarily destructive legislation through the House and Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite one independent analysis after another showing that each version of TrumpCare would cause premiums to spike, take coverage away from millions of people, rip protections away from patients with preexisting conditions, and gut  This fall--after TrumpCare failed another time in the Senate--he slashed by 90 percent the investments that help inform families about their coverage options and followed through on his year-long threat to discontinue payments designed to lower out-of-pocket costs for low-income enrollees.  This is a scenario that healthcare experts said would cause mass consumer confusion and anxiety, one that insurance companies planned for by shifting that burden of uncertainty to patients and taxpayers in the form of higher premiums and fewer options in State marketplaces.  Now, this is by no means the full list of ways President Trump has attempted his healthcare sabotage, but it does explain why we are here now. Today is the first day of the open enrollment period for 2018, and as a direct result of this President's actions, families are going to see higher premiums, more out-of-pocket costs, and fewer coverage options. Many families will have to change their coverage if they want to avoid paying hundreds of dollars more in premiums.  At a time when we need to continue to do more to bend the healthcare cost curve in the right direction, taxpayers are being burdened with higher[[Page S6942]]healthcare costs to the Federal Government--not because of any improvement in quality or comprehensiveness, just because of the chaos this administration has caused.  In fact, just last week, the Trump administration proposed a rule to double down on the sabotage in 2019 that would let insurers cover fewer services in addition to raising costs. I have to say, I just truly never imagined that a President of the United States would so openly and uncaringly root for the people of this country to be worse off. But that is exactly what President Trump is doing. It needs to be said, and it needs to be stopped.  What makes this even more frustrating is that a lot of it could have been stopped months ago if Republican leaders hadn't insisted on trying to help this administration carry out its partisan, wrecking-ball healthcare strategy.  Back in September, Chairman Alexander and I were very near agreement on a bipartisan bill to stabilize healthcare markets and protect families from higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs through regular order, through a process that actually engaged over half the We were on the verge of reaching an agreement when Republican leaders froze our negotiations. Why? In order to jam TrumpCare through the Senate one more time.  Let me repeat that. Republican leaders hit the pause button on a bipartisan process that could have lowered premiums and stabilized markets, exposing our patients and families to the full impact of President Trump's sabotage.  That is the bad news, but the good news is that the legislation Chairman Alexander and I ultimately agreed on can and will still have an impact--not just a few years from now but in 2018--if Republican leaders don't stand in the way again. Our bill would, among other priorities, continue out-of-pocket cost reduction payments and make sure that patients and families, not insurance companies, see the benefit of that certainty in the form of rebates next year. The legislation Chairman Alexander and I have proposed, with 12 Democratic and 12 Republican cosponsors, would do a lot to help us get things back on track. It would tie President Trump's hands on sabotage, and it would send a very powerful message that elected officials in Congress can work together to get things done when we focus on common ground rather than scoring political points.  I would once again urge the majority leader to allow our legislation to get a vote. It has the support of 60-plus Senators, and it is growing. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that it provides billions in savings and would stabilize the markets this year and lower premiums in 2019. And the President told Chairman Alexander that he supports this process moving forward.  There is no reason to wait. There is absolutely no excuse for inaction, and I am going to continue doing everything I can to make that clear until Republican leaders finally listen to the patients and families they serve.  Mr.President, while I am here today, I also want to take a few minutes to speak on another way that I believe President Trump and Republicans are taking our country in a direction that is deeply harmful; that is, by stacking our courts with extreme conservative judges.  The Senate this week is going to vote on four judicial nominees who each have the far-rightwing seal of approval. Two are on President Trump's short list for Supreme Court Justices, meaning they would automatically vote to overturn Roe v. Unfortunately, their views on many things--LGBTQ rights, sexual assault, criminal justice, and corporate interests--are just as deeply troubling. One of the nominees we are considering this week advocated for using electric shocks for criminal punishment, and two--Amy Barrett and Stephanos Bibas--were nominated only after Republicans blocked the nominations of Myra Selby and Rebecca Haywood--both who happen to be African-American women--to the respective benches.  It is clear that as Republican leaders' list of legislative failures grows longer, their effort to enact their agenda by administrative action and by stacking the courts is only going to accelerate. That might appeal to extreme conservatives--in fact, I am pretty sure it does--but the truth is that whether it is healthcare or infrastructure or taxes, most people across the country really want to see Congress working together.  I am going to continue doing everything I can to speak out and fight back against extreme, harmful steps that are being taken by this administration and allowed by Republican leaders here in Congress and also to show there is a better way to get things done--by working under regular order, across the aisle, and putting people, not politics, first. That is what families rightfully expect, and that is what we all should be focused on.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

828,topic-id,526,"Mr.President, everybody in Washington now knows that the special counsel has announced charges against two of President Trump's former campaign aides in connection with the ongoing investigation into whether Russia interfered with the 2016 election.  After painstaking investigations in the intelligence community, we now know that, in fact, Russia did interfere in the election. Since they have continued this pattern in other countries' elections, what many of us are concerned about is the fact that they will interfere in the next elections coming up. We have already seen attempts in the special election down in They have been trying to increase the number of hits going to a Facebook or Twitter account. So they interfered.  We also learned this morning that a third former Trump campaign aide has pled guilty to lying to the FBI in January when he was asked about his interactions while he was with the Trump campaign.  These are very serious charges, and we should be united against any individual who helped further Russia's interference in our elections. Yet, sadly, the response to these indictments has been seemingly split along partisan lines. That doesn't make sense. Defending America isn't a partisan issue. In fact, everyone in the Senate--all of our Democrats, Republicans, our two Independents--has sworn an oath to do exactly that, to defend the Constitution against all enemies, both foreign and domestic. So charging these individuals shouldn't be seen as a victory for one party or another. It shouldn't be seen as a defeat for a party. These individuals are charged with crimes against the United States, crimes against all of us  The fact is that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in our election, and in so doing, he has attacked the very foundation of our constitutional democracy. We know that, and we also know that we are not the only country he has attacked. According to the U.intelligence community, he will continue this type of behavior unless he is stopped, and that is why we have such a heavy responsibility to defend America from these kinds of attacks and to defend our American constitutional foundations that are built on a process of free and fair and unfetterred elections.  It doesn't matter whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, it should be clear: If you help an enemy of the United States meddle in our democracy, you will be held accountable.  Here in this Senate and throughout the country as a whole, too often we find ourselves suddenly divided on issues because of party politics. That shouldn't be the case. There should be no disagreement when it comes to protecting America because we should be Americans first--not Democrats or Republicans first; we should be Americans first.  We must continue to be patient with the Mueller investigation and allow it to follow the facts wherever they may lead because finding out what happened is the only way we are going to be able to prevent this from happening again, and it is the only way we are going to be able to keep our country safe.

If you lived in a mobile home, if you lived in a low-lying area, your home was destroyed. It is uninhabitable. The ceiling is collapsing. The mold and the mildew, because of all the water which has now accumulated, makes it an uninhabitable home.  FEMA, through individual assistance, is supposed to provide temporary housing. This is the law. That is what the people of Florida are entitled to--just like the people of Texas are entitled to in the Presiding Officer's State--but it is not happening in Why? Because they get on the telephone, and they have to wait up to--documented--4 hours to get somebody on the phone from FEMA or, for home inspections, it takes 45 days before they can get an inspector to come out and see the home so they can be declared eligible for individual assistance. That is just unacceptable.  If they don't have the means--especially if they don't have a job as a result of the jobs being destroyed in the hurricane--where are they going to be able to get temporary assistance for housing?

175,topic-id,948,"Mr.Speaker, on Tuesday, just yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 595, providing for consideration of an important piece of legislation, H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017.  The rule provides for consideration of H.2936 under a structured rule, with four Democratic amendments made in order and two bipartisan amendments and one Republican-led amendment made in order.  Mr.Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, a bill that is critically important to my district in central Washington State and to rural, forested districts like it across the United States who continue to face devastation from catastrophic wildfires as we have seen, just this last year, a great example of.  This bipartisan, comprehensive legislation is aimed at addressing the disastrous consequences of wildfires by utilizing the tools the Forest Service and other agencies have to reduce the threats posed by these wildfires, by insects, by disease infestation, and by dangerous old forest overgrowth that serves as a literal tinderbox for wildfires. This legislation will expedite and improve forest management activities in Federal forests to counteract these threats.  This legislation, spearheaded by my friend and colleague from Arkansas, Representative Bruce Westerman, who is a trained forester himself, is comprised of a truly comprehensive effort developed here in the people's It is bipartisan. This bipartisan support demonstrates that the threat of catastrophic wildfires does not just impact a red or a blue district, but, rather, it poses a threat to communities across the United States.[[Page H8310]]                                {time}  1230  H.2936 would provide Federal land management agencies immediate tools to increase the pace and the scale of forest management projects to dramatically improve the health and resiliency of our national forests, ensuring robust protection of the environment. Active management leads to healthier forests. It is that simple.  This legislation also allows expedited review for collaborative projects in Federal forests and removes incentives for special interest groups to file frivolous lawsuits. By requiring litigants opposing active management projects to propose an alternative management option, we can instill accountability into a system that is wrought with litigation.  Additionally, the legislation bolsters locally led forest management and hazardous fuel reduction projects to improve forest health.  By engaging local stakeholders, we can lessen the severity and the costs of wildfires, while protecting the communities and the environment.  Mr.Speaker, another major component of our Nation's wildfire crisis is the broken system with which we fund firefighting suppression. When these firefighting costs exceed the existing budget, the U.Forest Service transfers funds from other vital forest management program accounts in order to pay for wildfire suppression. I and a lot of other people in this Chamber have been outspoken critics of this dangerous broken cycle known as fire borrowing. That also is a very bipartisan position that is taken. H.2936 provides a major step forward in ending this cycle. By raiding accounts that provide for forest management programs which help prevent wildfires, we tie one hand behind our back in an effort to both prevent and suppress these catastrophic wildfires. This legislation will help to put an end to this longstanding problem.  Mr.Speaker, my constituents know as well as anyone the immense threat that wildfires pose to local communities. In just the past 4 years, the fourth district of my State, my district, has seen the two largest fires in Washington State's history. We have lost hundreds of homes and businesses and structures. My constituents are still struggling to recover from the Carlton Complex Fire of 2014 and the Okanogan Complex Fire of 2015. We lost three firefighters that year. That truly is a high cost.  Active forest management is a matter of saving lives and livelihoods, of protecting our communities, and ensuring our constituents' health and safety, which is why I am proud to support this rule and the underlying legislation that it represents today.  Mr.Speaker, as I have often said, we cannot continue to limp from one devastating fire season to the next. We must take significant steps toward reforestation, rehabilitation, and overall forest management. This legislation will allow us to do just that. We must begin to prevent, to suppress, to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, and the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 will be a momentous opportunity to turn around our diseased and overgrown Federal forests. This legislation is essential and desperately needed to change the current path of forest management on public lands. It is outdated, unsustainable, and dangerous.  Mr.Speaker, this is a straightforward rule allowing for consideration of this critical piece of legislation that will help protect our rural communities and ensure that we are prepared to respond to devastating and catastrophic wildfires that have plagued many areas of our country in the last few years.  Mr.Speaker, I support the rule's adoption, I urge my colleagues to support both the rule and the underlying bill.  Mr.Speaker, before I yield to my colleague from Florida, I would like to share one last note. Just a few weeks ago, the new chief of the U.Forest Service, Tony Tooke, came to Capitol Hill and briefed some of my colleagues, including me, regarding this year's devastating wildfire season.  He reported to us that over 8 million acres, just this year, have burned. We have also lost dozens of lives, thousands of homes. Chief Tooke left us with the stark fact that while more than 8 million acres burned this year, another 80 million acres across the United States are at high risk of catching fire--80 million acres. Mr.Speaker, if that does not show how dire this problem is, then I certainly can't tell you what does.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

201,topic-id,1244,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the newspaper article from the Methow Valley News, dated October 27.              [From the Methow Valley News, 27, 2017]              Smoke Is a Year-Round Problem in the Valley                           (By Ann McCreary)       Autumn in the Methow Valley brings cool, crisp weather,      bright days and colorful foliage. And smoke. Just like every      other season of the year.       The Methow Valley's clean, clear air--one of its key      attractions--is anything but clean and clear for extended      periods of the year. In fact, the Methow Valley has four      seasons of smoke, said Liz Walker, head of the Methow Valley      Clean Air       And it is not insignificant amounts of smoke, Walker said.      Air pollution in Twisp is among the worst in the state, based      on data from the Washington Department of       Each season in the Methow Valley brings its own source of      air pollution. In recent years, the all-too-familiar pall of      wildfire smoke has hung over the valley for days or weeks      during summer. As wildfires are put out by cooler, wet      weather of fall, the valley enters another phase of smoke      produced by prescribed burning in national forests, outdoor      burn piles and wood stoves for home heating.       In spring, prescribed burning begins again, as well as more      burn piles. ``Maybe a respite in June and early July, and      then wildfire season will be upon us,'' Walker said.       Although wildfire season can bring health-threatening      amounts of smoke to the valley, like last summer's Diamond      Creek Fire, poor air quality is a real concern in winter as      well, Walker said. ``We're susceptible to inversions and      stagnation in the winter months'' that trap wood stove smoke      on the valley floor, she said.       Smoke is the air pollutant of greatest concern in the      Methow Valley, and is monitored by the Department of      It is known as PM2.5, which means particulate matter that is      2.5 microns or smaller. These tiny particles are most      frequently caused by incomplete combustion, and can stay      airborne and can travel long distances, increasing the      likelihood that humans and animals will inhale them.       Data collected by a Department of Ecology air monitor in      Twisp ranked air quality at that site among the eight most-     polluted places in the state in 2016, Walker said. ``By      several of the measures the Department of Ecology uses to      look at PM2.5 pollution reported at air quality monitors      across the state, Twisp ranks among the worst in air      pollution--worse than metro Seattle or This is even      after PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is subtracted out,'' Walker      said.       There was insufficient data from the air pollution monitor      in Winthrop to assess air quality there last year, ``but it      is typically only slightly better than Twisp,'' Walker said.                              Public cost       ``Our valley cares a lot about this, and we're working      together to improve it. There's a real public health cost to      air pollution. Anyone who has sat around a campfire, or gone      for a strenuous hike on a smoky day has had a firsthand      lesson in the toxicity of smoke,'' Walker said.       Walker's concern about health impacts come from her      training as an environmental health toxicologist. Harmful      effects range from the inability to exercise outdoors, to      respiratory distress and infections, to increased risk of      cancer.       ``For vulnerable populations--babies, children, pregnant      women, elders, and anyone with heart or lung issues--bad air      days can mean serious health repercussions. For everyone,      chronic exposure to high levels of PM2.5 can potentially      trigger or exacerbate conditions such as headaches, asthma,      bronchitis and cardiovascular disease.''       There are economic costs of air pollution in the Methow      Valley as well, she said. ``We're a tourist economy,      dependent on the natural beauty of the valley,'' Walker said.       The Methow Valley Clean Air Project was launched in 2015 by      Raleigh Bowden, a local physician, after she saw people      suffering health effects of poor winter air quality, Walker      said. A key goal of the project is improving air quality      during the home heating season, October through       ``Due to our valley's frequent winter inversions, smoke      from woodstoves and outdoor burning pollutes our air to      frequently unhealthy levels,'' Walker said. ``We've focused      on the home heating season because this is when we can make      behavioral changes to improve our air quality. This is a      controllable source of pollution, as contrasted with      pollution from wildfires.''       The Clean Air Project outlines measures residents can take      to reduce pollution from wood stoves, including: Properly      season wood so that it is dry and burns cleaner; clean      chimneys yearly; build small, hot fires and don't damp them      down; comply with burn bans; upgrade to certified stoves or a      wood-burning alternative; weatherize homes.       The organization is also working to reduce outdoor burning      of yard waste and provide alternatives, including      ``vegetation drives'' sponsored by the Clean Air Project,      Walker said.                           Successful drives       Vgetation drives, supported by grants and partnerships,      were held in the fall of 2016 and spring of 2017, and another      drive is scheduled next spring. Past drives have collected      about 20 tons of vegetation, which prevented hundreds or      thousands of hours of smoke, Walker said.       The yard waste was dropped off by residents and hauled to      the county landfill during the first drive, conducted over      two days. During the second drive, conducted over eight days      in partnership with the Town of Twisp, residents delivered      vegetation to a site near the Twisp wastewater treatment      plant, where it was chipped and offered free for landscaping      and mulching.       ``The most unusual community participant brought his load      strapped to the back of his bicycle--now that's commitment to      clean air!'' Walker said.       The Clean Air Project also partnered this year with the      Pine Forest Homeowners Association to provide support for      chipping branches and slash created when underbrush and trees      were thinned and limbed as part of Pine Forest's ongoing      Firewise efforts. The debris would otherwise have been      burned.       Next spring's vegetation drive will be conducted in      partnership with the Okanogan Conservation District, Walker      said. She suggested that residents who have been accumulating      yard waste cover their piles this fall instead of burning      them, and haul them to the vegetation drive in the spring to      be chipped.       Walker acknowledged that it takes extra effort, and a      different mindset, to participate in a vegetation drive      rather than burn yard waste. ``It's hard. Our valley is long.      It requires a truck, loading it up and hauling it in,'' she      said. ``People have been outdoor burning in the valley      forever. It's how you get rid of your stuff when you live out      in the country.''       However, Walker said, many valley residents have been      supportive of the vegetation drives. ``People really      appreciate this as an option. They don't want to impact the      health of families and the community,'' she said.       For people who want to continue the longstanding local      tradition of burning yard waste, the Clean Air Project      suggests ``best practices for burning outdoors in the most      safe and clean way,'' Walker said.       ``Make sure the pile is as bone dry as possible. Make sure      you know what is a good day, with good ventilation, but not      too much wind. We've interacted with Fire District 6 and      smokejumpers. There are lots of folks with tons of knowledge      about how to build a hot, clean pile,'' she said.       The Clean Air Project is overseen by a volunteer advisory      group. The Methow Valley Citizens' Council is fiscal sponsor      for the organization. More information is available on the      Methow Valley Clean Air Project Facebook page.[[Page H8316]]    ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309-3.txt,2275,SENATE NEEDS TO TAKE UP HOUSE BILLS,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
202,topic-id,1243,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Florida for today's debate.  The issue of proactive management of our Nation's Federal forests is critically important to the future and economic well-being of our whole country as well as to the health of our Federal lands and safety of our rural communities.  Let me say that, if you have never been through a rural community that has had to face the devastation of a catastrophic fire, you are welcome to come to the State of Washington and see firsthand exactly the kind of damage that these fires can do.  This is of the highest priority, and I urge all my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying bill in order to combat these catastrophic wildfires and reform the way in which we manage our forests.  This rule provides for consideration of H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. This is bipartisan, it is comprehensive, and it aims at addressing the disastrous consequences of catastrophic wildfires by utilizing the tools the Forest Service and other agencies have to reduce the threats posed by these fires, by insects, by disease infestation, and by dangerous old forest overgrowth.  As I said, my district in central Washington and millions of acres across our great country continue to face this threat. We must take steps to prevent and address these fires, which this bill will do by reforming the way we prepare for, respond to, and fund wildfire response and mitigation efforts. These threats will only continue to worsen not only for my constituents, but for people all around the country.  We are recognizing sustained drought conditions. Mismanagement and failure to conduct maintenance of our forests on Federal lands will continue to plague this issue. The underlying legislation is essential and desperately needed to change the outdated, unsustainable, and untimely dangerous system of Federal forest management on these lands.  Mr.Speaker, this is a straightforward rule allowing for consideration of a critical piece of legislation that will help protect our rural communities and ensure we are prepared to respond to these devastating, catastrophic fires.

Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.3440.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

460,topic-id,843,"Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the Rules  I just want to express the tremendous frustration that I have and that Democrats have in general with the way the Republican leadership has handled the CHIP bill, IPAB, and community health centers, the legislation we are considering today and tomorrow.  First of all, I need to point out that it was over a year ago when I asked[[Page H8407]]leadership of our committee to try to come up with bipartisan legislation with regard to community health centers and SCHIP, the children's initiative, and all they wanted to do from January until September--9 months--was repeal the Affordable Care                              {time}  1330  That is all they were interested in. They didn't want to hear anything about CHIP or community health centers, just repeal the Affordable Care  My colleagues on the other side suggested that somehow, because of CHIP, they are very concerned about kids. Well, the fact of the matter is, if you repeal the Affordable Care Act, children--everyone--and community health centers would suffer such damage because they would lose their health insurance or the underpinnings of the community health centers, which have been financed with the Affordable Care Act, that any suggestion that somehow because you are concerned now about CHIP or community health centers is belied by the fact that you spent the last 9 months, through September, trying to repeal the Affordable Care If you really cared about these things, then you would not have sought that repeal.  Once that repeal seemed to be over in September, then the Republicans on the committee and the leadership were willing to talk about CHIP and community health centers. But mind you, the authorization for those two programs ended September 30. So it was literally too late.  Now my colleagues on the other side say: Oh, well, we are bringing this bill up today because we really care about kids and community health centers.  Exactly the opposite. If you did care, in the sense that you wanted to get legislation passed, then you wouldn't bring this bill up today. We all know that if the bill is not bipartisan, which it is not, it will never pass the What is going to happen is these bills will pass on a partisan vote on Friday and, as a consequence, they will go to the Senate and there will be no action and we will have to deal with this at the end of the year as part of some larger omnibus spending bill or whatever we do at the end of the year.  So anyone who tells you that the Republicans, in trying to pass a partisan bill, are actually moving forward on CHIP or on community health centers, that is simply not true.  Now, what are we facing here with these three bills? And I include IPAB, CHIP, and community health centers. What we are really facing is another effort on the part of the Republican leadership to repeal or sabotage the Affordable Care  All these things are part, in some fashion, of either pay-fors or authorization of the Affordable Care The fact of the matter is, we are now seeing what I would call piecemeal repeal.  You couldn't repeal it outright, so you do a piecemeal repeal. You repeal You basically use funding from the Prevention Fund and you gut that so you can pay for the CHIP funding. You change the grace period so something like half a million people lose their health insurance. Meanwhile, the President of the United States is out there every day issuing executive orders to get rid of cost-sharing subsidies to cut back on the outreach program.  If you look at all this, it is nothing more than a piecemeal repeal of the Affordable Care It is sabotaging the Affordable Care  This has not changed. The first 9 months to September, outright repeal. Now, between now and the end of the year, piecemeal repeal. Every day, a different bill.  The real inconsistency, which is the best I can say about what is going on, is to say that we have to come up with offsets to pay for the Children's Health Initiative Program and the community health centers, but we don't have to do it for $17.5 million is what it is going to cost, according to the CBO, to repeal If you use that money, it would almost pay for the CHIP and the community health centers bill that will be considered the next day.  So, again, we have this total inconsistency suggesting that somehow we care about one thing. What is really go on is robbing Peter to pay The way that you pay for the community health centers and the CHIP bill, basically, sabotaging the Affordable Care Act, is you shorten the grace period from 90 days to 30 days, when people, if they don't pay their premium, will lose their health insurance. We know that maybe almost 688,000 people, according to the CBO, will lose their health insurance.

These are going to go away in order to pay for CHIP and community health centers.  What is going on here is unbelievable. I just say to my colleagues: look at what is actually happening. We had a Democratic substitute and the Rules Committee wouldn't even let us consider it.  So it is not just the underlying issue of what is actually happening here in terms of the substance of the bills. It is also the process that is being used. That is why I am glad I am talking during the Rules Committee time.  We had a Democratic substitute that would have had a great piece of legislation that paid for the community health centers, paid for CHIP, without sacrificing other healthcare programs that help kids and other They wouldn't even let us consider it here today.  So I say to my colleagues: basically, vote ``no'' on the rule. Turn down this rule and let us have another opportunity to actually do something that is important and that is meaningful.

688,topic-id,344,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.849, the IPAB repeal.  Mr.Speaker, Republicans have spent the last 9 months trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and they have failed, but instead of working with Democrats to improve the ACA, they will stop at nothing to repeal the law piece by piece.  The Republicans' partisan bill to reauthorize CHIP, community health centers, and other public health extenders is paid for on the back of Medicaid recipients, Medicare, low- and middle-income families with the Affordable Care Act health coverage, and the Prevention Fund, but yet they will not bother to pay for the $17.5 billion it will cost to repeal  IPAB was enacted as a backstop to the other cost-saving and quality-improvement efforts in the ACA, such as accountable care organizations, patient-centered care models like Medical Homes, programs that pay for quality, not quantity and value-based purchasing.  Because of the Affordable Care Act and these programs, Medicare spending growth has slowed and Medicare solvency has been extended.  According to the CMS actuary, IPAB will not be triggered until 2021, so the[[Page H8418]]timing of today's repeal is premature and politically motivated.  IPAB repeal would increase the deficit by $17.5 billion. This is fiscally irresponsible of Republicans, especially as they prepare to announce a tax package that will saddle our country with $1.5 trillion of debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations.  IPAB repeal is not about helping seniors. Don't let the Republicans kid you. Contrary to what the Republicans say, IPAB is prohibited from sending recommendations to Congress that would harm seniors by increasing their out-of-pocket costs or cutting their benefits. In fact, it is the Republican ACA repeal efforts that would cut nearly a trillion dollars from Medicaid and Medicare, harming seniors and other vulnerable Americans, which would have truly led to the rationing of healthcare.  So for all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.849, the IPAB repeal.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

697,topic-id,800,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I can't help but put what is happening today in terms of the Republicans putting up this bill on the IPAB and what is happening tomorrow with the Republicans putting up a CHIP and community health centers bill but point out that collectively what they are trying to do is what they were not able to do in the first 9 months of this session when they sought very hard and pushed very hard to repeal the Affordable Care  What is going on here today and tomorrow with the IPAB and community health centers and CHIP is essentially an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act piece by piece, in my opinion.  What do we do?  We see the IPAB, which is part of the Affordable Care We see the pay-fors for community health centers and the CHIP tomorrow, taking away money from the Prevention Fund from the Affordable Care Act, limiting the grace period when people will lose their insurance that they have under the Affordable Care  This goes along also with what is happening with the President as well. The President has, in the last month or so, said that he is not going to pay the cost-sharing subsidies. He has cut back on the outreach so that people don't know what is in the Affordable Care He has cut back on the period when people can sign up and get their insurance in half.  What we are seeing, in my opinion, is the Republicans sabotaging the Affordable Care They couldn't repeal it, so now they are doing whatever they can to sabotage it. It is really ironic or inconsistent, however you want to put it. On the one hand they are insisting that when it comes to kids and community health centers, which is a group of people you would think they would be most concerned about, they insist on paying for it by taking money from other healthcare programs. We are asked to take money from the Prevention Fund, which pays for vaccines for children, which pays for the children's lead poisoning program, which is a major part of our opiate prevention program. This is the money that comes from the Prevention Basically, they are taking that money and using it to pay for the community health centers and the Children's Health Initiative, which means that that money is lost. That money is lost for those other purposes.  With regard to the grace period, they are saying, well, if you fail to pay your insurance, it used to be 90 days before you lost it. Now it would be 30 days before you lost it, which means that you end up with about 500,000 or 600,000 people who have insurance now under the Affordable Care Act that would lose it, according to the  Yet, at the same time, with the IPAB repeal, which we are considering now, which costs $17.5 billion, and which, as my colleague from Vermont said, is a mechanism to try to save costs, they are saying: Well, we don't have to pay for that. We can just repeal it. We will forego those additional costs, which become part of the deficit.  Mr.Speaker, for all these reasons, the bottom line is, what the Republicans are doing is not fair. It is not fair to the kids. It is not fair to the people who are going to lose their health insurance.  I will say as the last thing that this is going nowhere. One of the reasons why Democrats have been urging the Republicans with regard to the CHIP and community health centers to work with us on a bipartisan basis is because we know if this bill passes today on a partisan vote, because we can't support it for the reasons I explained, then that means that it is going to go to the Senate and it is going to die because there is no reason to believe that the Senate is going to take up this partisan bill.  I think it is just a huge mistake on the part of Basically, what they are signaling today is that they don't really care about this. They wanted to stick around until the end of year, which means the community health centers and CHIP just basically wither on the vine for lack of funds. That is not fair. It is not fair to the kids. It is not fair to those who use community health centers.  Mr.Speaker, for all these reasons, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the bill today, the IPAB repeal; and I will also ask for a ``no'' vote tomorrow on the CHIP and the community health centers legislation.

56,topic-id,1315,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate Mr.Lipinski's kind words, but I[[Page H8380]]think he and I know best that we had good teachers to help us understand what it takes to get things done here in the United States Congress, and, most importantly, that is the ability to work together.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud to stand here today with all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, who are on the Climate Solutions As you have heard tonight, and as we know, the Climate Solutions Caucus is a bipartisan caucus that gives Democrats and Republicans the opportunity to sit down and to discuss ways not only to protect our environment, but to protect our homes, our Nation's economy, and our Nation's security.  Yes, this caucus consists of people from separate political parties, but all of us are united in our belief that we must have this dialogue to defend our future.  Being from the central coast of California, where we have over 120 miles of stunning coastline in my district, we understand the vulnerability that comes with rising sea levels, something that can impact our economy, our security, and, of course, our daily lives.  The co-chairs of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Florida Representatives Carlos Curbelo and Ted Deutch, they understand and they appreciate that threat, for earlier this year Florida was pummeled by Hurricane Irma and the subsequent severe flooding, a storm that affected the lives of millions of Americans and cost billions in recovery and cleanup efforts.  We have seen that at times of crisis like that, despite the damage and despite our differences, our government and even this Congress can come together and put back together those communities. That is our government during an emergency, and at times where there are storms, where there is damage, we are motivated to come together and govern.  This year, my district saw this type of governing due to damage it suffered during the major winter storms earlier in 2017.                              {time}  2045  Every county in my district saw devastation. One county in particular, Monterey County, suffered an extreme amount of damage--the town of Big Sur, along the coast of California, in particular. The northern route of Highway 1, going into Big Sur, suffered a knockout of a major bridge. The southern route had a major landslide, leaving that community isolated.  But I can tell you, 2 weeks ago, I stood on the brand-new bridge that was built. And as I was standing there, to me, it was a story of the people of Big Sur, very resilient, always coming back from these types of situations. But it was also the story of government working, people and government coming together, getting things done to help people.  Now, just prior to that, I had read a New York Times editorial, where the title of that editorial was, ``We Used to Build Things.'' And it was by David Brooks, and he talked about this big fire called the Big Burn, back in the early 1900s, that started in Washington and Oregon and spread throughout the upper West, all the way into And from that devastating fire arose something, and that was the U.Forest  When I read that article, it reminded me that, throughout the history of this Nation, we have always built things to help people. We have engineered infrastructure to energize our economy, and we have expanded agencies to embolden and to empower our communities and the people who live there.  So now, after the storms on the West Coast, after the flooding in the Midwest, and after the hurricanes on the East Coast, it is our turn. It is time for this generation, our generation, to build things in a smart and resilient fashion, so that future generations are secure and safe in their homes and in their communities. And we need to start by focusing on and building infrastructure that is strong and stable to sustain the inevitable intense storms of the future.  Now, we know, and what has been confirmed by the nonpartisan Federal Government Accountability Office, that extreme weather events are already costing U.taxpayers billions and billions of dollars each year. According to that GAO report, the Federal Government spent more than $350 billion over the last decade on losses to private property and disaster assistance programs from natural disasters.  Now, that amount doesn't even include the massive price tag on the recovery effort from this year's hurricanes and fires that are expected to be amongst the costliest in our Nation's history. And we know that it is going to get worse as storms are more intense, and recovery efforts are going to cost more. So we need to recognize and we need to realize the need for smart rebuilding.  Now, after the 2012 hurricane up in New York, Hurricane Sandy, there was a Rebuilding Task Force that was put together, and it recommended that Federal flood protection measures should entail that projects receiving Federal dollars, they should comply with elevation and flood-proofing measures to avoid rebuilding them after future storms. The report wanted to ensure that we do not need to pay multiple times to repair for flooding damages in flood-impacted areas.  In 2015, the administration put forward the Federal Flood Risk Management That was a standard that set out that federally financed infrastructure projects must be built to withstand future storms and flooding. That standard was meant to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and communities are protected.  However, in August, this administration decided to roll back the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, a decision that was compounded by its poor timing, as it was announced 2 weeks before the hurricanes that ripped apart Houston, Florida, and Puerto  So last month, Congressman Curbelo and I introduced the Federal Infrastructure Flood Resiliency Act, a bipartisan bill that ensures that Federal agencies complete implementation of a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard; such a standard that will not just benefit our coastal communities, it will help our government, and it will help our country, because we know that every dollar that is invested in flood mitigation efforts results in $4 in saved flood recovery costs. This is something that Republicans and Democrats understand.  After Hurricane Harvey, the Governor of Texas, Mr.Abbott, stated: ``As we go through the build-out phase, and rebuilding Texas, part of our focus must be on rebuilding in a way that will prevent a disaster like this from happening again.''  Mr.Speaker, by investing in more resilient project designs, our communities will be able to recover quickly, and they will be protected against any future flooding. Taking these prudent steps will save taxpayer dollars and prevent future loss of life and property. It is a commonsense step that we can take toward responsible, bipartisanship governing; and it is this type of governing that needs to happen all the time.  Now, when I stood on that bridge, and I was there celebrating the reopening of that bridge, the reopening to Big Sur, I also thought that this was government at its best, where the government came together, it responded, it reacted in record fashion, and it reconstructed a major bridge.  So yes, it made me proud, but it also made me realize that we need to stop just governing by crisis. We need to start governing with leadership. We need to come together to get things done, not just in emergency situations, not just for natural disasters of today, but we need to start governing for tomorrow.  The Climate Solutions Caucus understands and believes that we, in Congress, need to lead. We need to do that by coming together. We do that by talking about the effects of climate change. We do that with Flood Risk Management Standard legislation, and we don't necessarily do it for us. We do it for our children.  That is leadership, and that is why I am proud to be on the Climate Solutions  ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374.txt,1E+14,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,1,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

664,topic-id,373,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H.849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare This discussion is not new. Republicans and Democrats came together to pass this same bill back in 2015. This year there is, once again, strong bipartisan support with 45 Democratic Members and 225 Republican cosponsors. It passed out of the Ways and Means Committee last month with bipartisan support, too.  This bill will repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, created in ObamaCare, the Affordable Care The IPAB puts 15 unelected bureaucrats in charge of Medicare spending with significant unilateral powers to slash payments to providers, forcing them to stop seeing Medicare patients without any accountability, judicial review, or transparency.  The board's unprecedented authority to alter Medicare policy could ultimately reduce seniors' access to healthcare and put the government, rather than the patient, at the center of the healthcare system.  Putting Medicare on a sustainable financial footing is a top priority for all of us here in Congress, but passing the buck to a handful of unaccountable bureaucrats is not the right approach.  Last year, the Medicare Trustees Report stated that this was to be the year that the IPAB's authority to make cuts would be triggered. Fortunately, this year's Medicare Trustees Report has given us slightly more time, but next year, they can come back and move that date up once again. This is a cloud that will hang over providers and beneficiaries, unless we act and pass this bill today.  Now some have stated that this bill does not solve any immediate problem, and they have questioned the need to act on the bill today. I believe that our seniors and our healthcare providers are a priority. Why should we kick the can down the road when we can stop this today?  There are letters of support from over 700 bipartisan groups representing patients, employers, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals all voicing strong support for IPAB repeal.  They believe that the threat of this board is enough to warrant repeal and to place the decisionmaking back in the hands of elected Members of Congress, and I agree.

763,topic-id,814,"Mr.Chairman, our national forests are overgrown, and the thinning projects which would restore them to health are delayed by lengthy and costly regulations and litigations. In New Mexico, it takes a look like this: the top picture is a picture of one of our national forests, and the bottom picture is a picture from an area that has been thinned.  Now, take, for example, the Lincoln National Forest near Ruidoso, the Mescalero Forest is butted right up against it, so we are able to get a good comparison.  Now, typically, the forests in the West look like this: widely spaced trees and mostly grass in between, so when the fires came, they were grass fires. The tree rings show us that every 8 years a fire occurred, and it would keep the small underbrush and the small diameter trees, the small, unhealthy ones, it would keep those burned out and our forests, again, looked like this.  But because all of the thinning projects and all of the timber projects have been canceled for decades now, our forests, instead, look like this. When wildfires happen, they burn catastrophically and burn everything in their sight.  So my amendment today simply allows the Forest Service to move forward on balanced thinning programs in large scale. Typically, they do all of the paperwork, all of the studies for small acreage, maybe 30 acres or 50 acres. Since the forests are about a million acres, you would never get through and never get the forest restored to its health, and that is the problem.  The Forest Service has been working with me on the language for this amendment and submitted almost exact language that we have put here on the floor today. They agree with us that they should restore the forest to its health, but the environmental groups and the outside litigation have stopped the programs completely.  Now, in New Mexico, this means jobs, but it also means the health of our environment, and it means the destruction of endangered species, because when the fires burn through, we get the effect on the next page; again, this is that same Lincoln National Forest that we were looking at just a second ago. This is after the Little Bear fire, which burned 255 homes and almost 40,000 acres.  We almost lost the entire town of If the fire had just capped over the mountain, it would have burned straight down the side. The winds were exactly the direction which would have caused that.  So the Forest Service is agreeing with us that we need to do some thinning, and we are not going to be able to do it without legislative language, so this amendment is being offered here today.                              {time}  1700  We used to have 123 mills working in New Mexico clearing timber, processing it. We have got vast national[[Page H8355]]forests, and all of those have been shut down. The spotted owl came along in 1993, and the findings from the Fish and Wildlife Service was that logging was the reason that the spotted owl was going extinct.  Over 20 years later, Dan Ashe, the head of Fish and Wildlife Service, said: Oops, we made a mistake and we burned down the West, and we have ruined our forests over a mistake. There was actually another predator out there. We still have the problem to go in and clean up these forests before they burn and before they look like this.  Another real problem that exists is when we burn our national forests, then the watersheds are going to be choked up with mud, with ash, and with everything else.  This is Bonita Lake there in that same Lincoln National Forest near It provides the drinking water for several major communities in the southern part of the That lake was about 75 feet deep, pristine water, had fish in there. It was a recreational area right in the middle of the national forest.  The Forest Service was alarmed at how much damage was going to occur to this lake if they didn't log above it, so they put in a project. They were sued and work grounded to a halt. They did not get to thin that area above the lake. A fire occurred, this fire that you just saw in the previous slide. Now, that 75-feet-deep lake is filled with 50-feet of mud and ash. It killed all of the fish. It is not suitable for drinking. The community does not have the money in order to drain that lake and to refill it.  So that is what we find in the West because of these forest management processes. My amendment would simply allow the Forest Service to move forward on large-scale projects. They would still have to do all of the studies, everything. They would just be expedited.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

They burned human life. They burned animal life. They burned habitat and they contaminate our waterways.  Those are the problems that we are trying to solve. The Forest Service agrees with us that the restrictions are too great, and they have worked with us on the language, understanding that they must go through the studies, they must do the work that is required, but we can expedite those in order to do larger-scale thinning projects.

296,topic-id,2025,"Mr.President, since 2001, the Federal Government has exploded in constant dollars from $2.4 trillion in 2000 to last year almost $3.9 trillion in costs. Those are constant dollars. In September of this year, just a few weeks ago, our national debt surpassed $20 trillion for the first time, and no one in Washington blinked an eye. If that is not enough of a wakeup call, this debt is projected to increase over the next 10 years, according to the budget we are operating under now, by another $11 trillion. If that is not enough, over the next 30 years alone, it is projected that over $100 trillion of future unfunded liabilities--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, pension benefits for Federal employees, and the interest-only debt--are coming at us like a freight train. These are unfunded liabilities.  Today, with $20 trillion in debt, we are only paying about $270 billion every year in interest only. I say that because just in the last year, we have seen four increases in the Federal funds rate, which fundamentally increases our interest by 100 basis points. That 100 basis points over the next few years will grow our interest on the debt by more than $200 billion on top of the $270 billion. By the way, today that is almost 25 percent of our discretionary budget, already, just at the $270 billion. If it doubles, it will be almost half of our discretionary budget. If interest rates just go back to their 30-year norm--between 4 percent and 5 percent--we could be paying as much as $1 trillion on our Federal debt. That is almost equal to today's discretionary budget.  It is going to take a long-term fix. We can't tax our way out of this problem. We can't cut our way out of this problem, and we can't just simply grow our way out. It is going to take a multifaceted approach. There are five interwoven imperatives that are at work in solving this problem. It is one thing to call the crisis, but it is another to call out the ways to fix it, and they are all within our grasp today.  1, we need to fix Washington's broken budget process.  2, we need to root out all the wasteful spending in the Federal Government today.  3, we have to grow the economy by repealing and pulling back on a lot of regulations that are unnecessary, by revamping our tax structure and by unleashing our energy potential.  4, we have to save Social Security and Medicare, of which both trust funds go to zero in 14 short years.  Lastly, we finally have to get after the real drivers of spiraling healthcare costs.  As we are working to change our archaic tax system to become competitive with the rest of the world and to get our economy rolling again, I want to talk about two things today. One is[[Page S6909]]this wasteful spending, and two is economic growth. These are two of the five imperatives that I just outlined.  According to the General Accountability Office, today and also every single year, this Federal Government wastes hundreds of billions of dollars. It is estimated today--and this bipartisan organization has identified this--that we are overspending about $700 billion a year.  Let's put that in perspective. As I just said, we spent $3.9 trillion running the entire Federal That is about $1 trillion for discretionary spending and about $3 trillion for mandatory spending--so almost $4 trillion. Of that, over $700 billion has been identified as wasteful spending. I will describe those in a second, but to put it in perspective, that is almost 20 percent of everything we spend as a Federal It is a larger number than what we spend on the national security of our country. Let me say that again. The number identified by the General Accountability Office of wasteful spending is larger than what we spend on our military.  There are three facets to this as they outlined. 1 is redundant agencies. These are agencies targeted to do exactly the same thing that one administration or another has come in and added and that basically do the same things. That costs about $135 billion every year.  Just since 2003, we spent $1.2 trillion in improper payments. That is about $144 billion every year. These are overpayments--improper payments. This is not fraud. This is not anything like that. It is basically an administrative error, where the Federal Government has made a mistake and made improper payments--Social Security Disability, SNAP overpayments, unemployment insurance, and others. This is outrageous.  The third item is that it is estimated that we have a net tax gap of $406 billion. This is a 17-percent error rate in the IRS Tax That means that people are underpaying or not paying what is calculated, according to the General Accountability The Federal Government last year took in almost $3.5 trillion of taxes. Yet we had this $400 billion. That is a 17-percent error rate. I don't know what else to say. Those three things add up to about $700 billion of wasted spending. We have to get to the bottom of this. Let me also put it in perspective another way. That $700 billion every year is $7 trillion over the next 10 years.  This tax package we are talking about has an initial cost of about $1.5 trillion, as identified by both sides, before you get to the economic growth that more than pays for it. A 0.4 percent of growth pays for this tax package that we are working on. But this $7 trillion of wasted spending is overspending by the Federal Government, unnecessarily. Nobody in this body--no Democrat, Republican, or Independent--has voted on this spending. This is spending in error. These are just common mistakes made by an oversized bureaucracy. It is not a partisan talking point. Both sides bear responsibility in this debacle.  Again, these are numbers from the nonpartisan Government Accountability I am apoplectic that I even have to be here bringing this to the attention of my colleagues. Washington knows about these problems and has known for years--decades. Yet nothing is done. A former Member, Senator Tom Coburn, actually worked hard on this. There are others who are beginning to pick up this mantle here, as I am.  But as we talk about the tax package changes--the tax changes that will get this economy growing again--I wanted us to reflect on the opportunity we have right here that can more than pay for what we need to do to give the middle class a tax break and get our economy growing again. There are things identified in this report by the Government Accountability There are recommendations that can get at most of this $700 billion of wasted spending.  Let me give you a couple of examples. If the Department of Defense just manages commissaries more effectively, there is a $2 billion opportunity there over the next 5 years. If the Department of Defense weapon acquisition programs were more effective, it is estimated that tens of billions of dollars over the next 10 years could be saved in terms of purchasing the same level of equipment and machinery. If the Department of Defense simply completed an audit, we believe it would identify further opportunities for wise spending of our taxpayers' money.  But since coming to the United States Senate, I was shocked to understand that the largest line item on our budget has never been audited. It is high time that we complete that audit. By the way, there is a law that was passed in this body in 1991 requiring the Department of Defense to submit an audit. Here we are in 2017, and we still don't have that audit.  In my opinion, as hard as it is for the American people to earn their salaries and to pay their taxes, it is unconscionable that I am standing before the U.Senate tonight reminding us all that there is $700 billion a year that we spend in error--just bureaucratic error. Because of that and because of this financial intransigence, we have built up a debt that has created a crisis in our country. Because of these years of fiscal intransigence, we are losing the ability to fund our government the way it should be funded.  We are losing the right to do the right thing when it comes to funding things like emergencies and disaster relief efforts. Just a couple of weeks ago, we passed a $15 billion relief package for two hurricanes. Last week, we passed a $36 billion supplemental, as if nothing had happened. Every time we do that, it is borrowed money. We can wait no longer to solve this debt crisis. It is going to take tough decisions to solve the debt crisis, and we are going to have to be making these very quickly, but eliminating redundant spending, improper payments, and eliminating this tax gap are at the top of the list.  Along with reducing our spending by almost 20 percent each year, we need to grow the economy to solve this debt crisis. The single most important thing that we can do to grow the economy this next year is to change this Tax  Let me remind this body that so far this year, under this President's guidance, we eliminated over 860 rules. These were rules made by the Federal Government that were choking the very life out of our free enterprise system. The result of that this year alone is that in the third quarter we have now achieved a 3-percent growth again. This is not the Holy  Who knows what this economy should be growing at right now if we just get Washington out of the way? Part of the way to do that is to correct this archaic tax policy. Changing the Tax Code will mean more jobs and higher wages for the American worker. For example, if we eliminate the repatriation tax on our corporations--again, we are the last country in the world to have a double tax on U.profits made overseas--it is estimated by independent, nonpartisan groups, that this would mean $4,000 to $9,000 of annual income for the average worker in the United  I don't know what else to tell you, except that we are not competitive today. We have to become more competitive. What we are talking about here should not be partisan issues. America needs to be competitive. We all know that.  The idea that bigger government will create more jobs has been proven not to work. Look at the last 8 years. We have had the lowest economic growth in the history of the United  As we debate how to fix this archaic tax system and become competitive with the rest of the world, I am reminding us tonight that we also need to get serious about cutting this wasteful spending. This spending is not benefiting anybody. It is not providing for national security. It is not taking care of people who need help. These are just simply overpayments, mispayments, and they are creating problems that should not have been created. Changing the Tax Code, as I said, is a historic opportunity to generate growth and make us more competitive. Eliminating this spending, which amounts to 20 percent of what we spend as a Federal Government, is absolutely mandatory. People back home should be demanding that.  There is a lot of heavy lifting to dig out of this debt crisis, but these two things I am reminding us of tonight should be at the top of the list. We simply cannot fail the American people to get this done. I am committed to that.[[Page S6910]]I urge my colleagues to take seriously this opportunity we have of changing our Tax It is historic. At the same time, we have to get serious about eliminating our redundant, outrageous, and unnecessary spending.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The clerk will report the pending nomination.

322,topic-id,595,"Mr.President, today I wish to observe the 50th anniversary of Detroit's tumultuous summer of 1967, widely known as the 1967 Detroit Riot or the 12th Street The events of 1967 made a tremendous impact on the city and coincided with multiple incidents that took place across the country during that historic summer.  On Sunday July 23, 1967, patrons of an after-hours club were celebrating servicemembers coming home from Vietnam, above the Economy Printing Company on Clairmont Avenue and 12th At 3:30 a.m., police officers raided the club, which was within a mostly African-American business district with an active nightlife, arresting 85 people.  While the police arrested each person inside of the establishment, a crowd formed on the outside. Those who were gathered began reacting to the escalating discord between those who lived in the neighborhood and the police department. As time elapsed, a rise of arson and looting began to erupt. By 8 a.m., the number grew to an estimated 3,000 people who assembled in protest. As the Detroit police force struggled to contain the crowd, Mayor Jerome Cavanagh and Governor George Romney agreed to deploy the Michigan National Guard that afternoon; paratroopers joined 2 days later.  Just over 7,200 arrests were made between July 23 and July 27, 1967. As tensions began to subside, community members and government officials surveyed the aftermath. More than 1,600 buildings were destroyed, and the cost of damage to commercial and residential property totaled an estimated $132 million. Beyond property damage, the community suffered the loss of 43 citizens and hundreds were injured.  Detroit's 1967 unrest was not an isolated event; urban centers across the country were experiencing similar instances of civil disturbance. A day after the conclusion of the unrest in Detroit, President Lyndon Johnson sought out to investigate the cause of the phenomenon, establishing the Kerner The Commission concluded that the riots that took place between 1965 and 1968 were due to racism and frustration at lack of economic opportunity. From these findings, the Commission suggested economic, social, and housing reform to quell tensions.  The events of that summer were seen through countless eyes. Many Detroiters saw the unrest as a rebellion against the systemic oppression that plagued the African-American community, who had no voice or adequate representation in government or in the police force but accounted for one-third of Detroit's population. Various government agencies painted the events as an insurrection, war, or riot. Regardless of how the events were characterized, there is no denial of the real emotional and physical toll the summer had on citizens. The countless stories of people in their homes watching tanks roll down the very streets children once played in or the visual of soldiers with rifles on their backs juxtaposed to mothers walking along the same sidewalk with their babies in strollers, illustrated the surreal nature of the unrest and the response.  I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating an event that affected not only the city of Detroit and the State of Michigan but was a pivotal moment in our Nation's history. Detroit stands as the birthplace of Motown, center of the automotive industry, and the ``Arsenal of Democracy.'' It has been and continues to be a city of innovation and promise. I am proud of its resilience and the grassroots efforts contributing to its resurgence. The 50th anniversary of the civil unrest is a great opportunity to reflect and learn from the events of the past, celebrate progress, and to continue to support community partnerships that influence future success that is inclusive of all neighborhoods.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-30-pt1-PgS6872.txt,2113,ENCOURAGING PUBLIC OFFERINGS ACT OF 2017,2017,30,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

520,topic-id,837,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in proud support of America's workers--the men and women who build our cars and our homes, who move American-made products across oceans, lakes, and highways, who teach our children every school day, who take care of our families when they get sick, and who keep us safe in our communities. I have seen firsthand the importance of unions, both in my home State, where I grew up, and across the country.  This is deeply personal for me. My father Herb was a public school teacher and an active member of the Michigan Education My father-in-law Raul was a proud member--and continues to be a proud member--of the United Auto  My mother Madeleine found economic opportunity as a nurse's aide. As part of providing the best care possible to patients, she fought for a better workplace for her colleagues, and then she went on to help organize her workplace. She later served as a union steward with the  My parents raised me in a middle-class, union household. They instilled in me the need, both, to stand up for rights and to never take those rights for granted.  Standing together for fair wages, safer workplaces, and better hours, Michigan's strong labor movement built the American manufacturing sector and a middle class that made the United States a global economic powerhouse.  My parents and their fellow union members embraced the union values that built Michigan: the ability to earn a good life where you grow up, hard work, fairness, and looking out for your neighbor--whether it is your neighbor on the assembly line or in your neighborhood. These are not just union values. These are American values, and I learned to cherish them at a very young age. Now, I am sorry to say, these values are under attack, and I can't help but to take it personally.  This year we have seen new and unprecedented attempts to undermine our Nation's workers and their ability to collectively bargain. Earlier this year, my Republican colleagues passed legislation to repeal Federal rules that simply required businesses to disclose previous workplace safety and fair pay violations before they could contract with the Federal The reason for this rule was fairly straightforward: We should not be sending taxpayer dollars to employers that can't keep their employees safe or that cheat them out of their hard-earned dollars. Yet Republicans repealed the rule.  Now, across the country, we are seeing a wave of so-called right-to-work legislation, which in practice means you can work more hours for less pay. In Michigan we are seeing the impact of this misguided legislation.  Supporters of these policies told us that wages and job growth would increase if Michigan just passed laws to crack down on union membership. Well, Michigan has the law, but workers and their families aren't seeing any of the promised benefits.  In the years since passage of the law, the economic data clearly shows that, yes, corporate profits are up but not wages. In fact, when comparing Michigan to States that haven't attacked union membership, studies suggest that we have fallen behind pro-union States when it comes to worker pay.  I am deeply concerned by the ongoing efforts to implement national anti-union laws, including the Janus v. AFSCME case that the U.Supreme Court will rule on in the very near future. A negative ruling in this case would be a huge loss for American workers and would undermine the right to collectively bargain.  We should be doing everything we can to support American workers and their right to fight for better working conditions, fair pay, and the ability to care for their families. Instead of attacking our Nation's labor unions, we should be celebrating them.  For generations, unions have helped America build the world's most robust middle class and a powerful economy, second to no other nation. Unions have not only helped workers to take home more pay and have a safe place to work, but they have also built communities. Unions teach their members valuable skills and help them earn a secure retirement and have quality healthcare.  Big corporations are not trying to undermine unions because they are looking out for newly hired employees. They are fighting against unions because of what unions stand for--the right to collectively bargain for better pay, increased workplace safety, hard-earned retirement benefits, and quality healthcare.  I ask my colleagues to take a moment to consider our history and the hard-working men and women who built this great Nation of ours. Union members are our neighbors, our firefighters, our police officers, our teachers, our nurses, our brothers and sisters, our moms, and our dads. They build our cars, our homes, and our infrastructure.  I urge all of my colleagues to honor these men and women by opposing any and all efforts to expand harmful policies designed to undermine American workers.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

599,topic-id,618,"Mr.President today, I wish to recognize a crusader and legal titan, the Honorable Damon Keith of Detroit, MI, for his legendary 50-year career as a Federal judge.  Judge Keith's career in public service began during World War II, when he served in a segregated military where he faced discrimination as he served his The injustice he experienced led him to dedicate his life to equality for all  Judge Keith received his law degree from the prestigious Howard His professor and mentor was none other than the Honorable Thurgood Marshall, who argued the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education and the first African-American Justice to serve on the U.Supreme Just like his mentor, Judge Keith would go on to make groundbreaking rulings.  While African-American citizens in the South suffered through the institutionalized practices of segregation, Michigan was not immune from racial discrimination. After his 1970 decision in Davis v. School District of Pontiac, allowing busing to help integrate schools, Judge Keith faced threats of violence from the Ku Klux Despite threats placed against his own life, Judge Keith stood firm. Judge Keith continued his fight for civil rights in 1971 when he found that the city of Hamtramck practiced discriminatory community development which largely displaced African American residents. He ordered the city to replace the homes that were demolished. After the civil unrest in Detroit in 1967, actions were taken to improve racial inequality in the city. African-Americans accounted for one-third of Detroit's population but were underrepresented in its government and police force. Judge Keith ruled to uphold the city of Detroit's affirmative action plan and its good faith effort to promote diversity in its police force.  Judge Keith heard cases that presented new questions and challenged long-held interpretations of the In the 1971 landmark case, United States v. United States District Court, widely known as the Keith Case, the Supreme Court upheld Judge Keith's ruling that the Nixon administration could not wiretap citizens without a court order, even in cases involving domestic terrorism. This ruling protected Fourth Amendment rights for all Americans and enforced the boundaries of warrantless surveillance, paving the way for the U.Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, of 1978, which provides judicial and congressional oversight of the government's foreign intelligence surveillance activities.  After the tragedy of the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent war on terror, we once again faced circumstances that tested the balance between the power of the government and fundamental civil liberties. Judge Keith found himself ruling against another administration in the 2002 case, Detroit Free Press v. Attorney General John Ashcroft and Chief Immigration Judge Michael Creppy directed that hearings regarding immigration and deportation cases, deemed to be of interest to the investigation of the September 11, 2001, attacks, be closed to the public. When this case came before Judge Keith, he affirmed that the directive was unconstitutional and that deportations should not be shrouded in secrecy, famously proclaiming that, ``Democracies die behind closed doors.''  It is my pleasure to recognize the Honorable Damon Keith for his incredible half century on the bench and as one of the most influential jurists in American history. Judge Keith has a heart of gold and a will of steel, showing great courage in the face of danger and injustice. In his relentless pursuit of equality and justice, he has garnered many honors and admirers. In his life, Judge Keith not only witnessed some of the most critical moments in this Nation's history, but he has also contributed immensely to making America a better and more fair place.

From May 13 to 15, 1969, then-PFC McCloughan repeatedly put himself in the line of fire to extract and treat his fellow soldiers.  Specialist 5 McCloughan was born in South Haven, MI, in 1946 and spent his childhood in Bangor, He became a four-sport varsity athlete at Bangor High School and would go on to play football, baseball, and to wrestle at Olivet Three months after accepting a teaching and coaching position with South Haven Public Schools, McCloughan was drafted into the U.Army in 1968.  McCloughan's superiors took notice of his knowledge of sports medicine, and he was assigned to Fort Sam Houston, TX, to report for advanced training as a medical specialist. Upon his completion of training, McCloughan was assigned as a combat medic with Company C, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 196th Light Infantry Brigade, American Division, and was deployed to  On the morning of May 13, 1969, two American helicopters were shot down near Tam KY, and one crashed 100 meters from McCloughan and Charlie A squad was sent to rescue the downed crew and found a wounded soldier too injured to move. McCloughan ran 100 meters through an open field, dodging crossfire between Charlie Company and the NVA, reached the wounded soldier, and carried him back to the company and successfully saved his fellow soldier from being captured or killed.  Later that same day, McCloughan displayed another act of heroism in the midst of an American airstrike against nearby NVA targets. While in a trench, he saw two U.soldiers huddled together without weapons in the midst of an ambush. McCloughan dropped his weapon and rushed into the ambush to check on his comrades. While inspecting them for wounds, he was hit with shrapnel when a rocket-propelled grenade exploded nearby. McCloughan pulled the two soldiers back to the trench and would go back into the ambush zone four more times to extract wounded comrades. Wounded and bleeding himself, McCloughan refused to evacuate and remained on the battlefield to treat the wounded and prepare them for extraction.  The next day, Charlie Company engaged NVA forces near Nui Yon Similar to the day before, McCloughan again went into the crossfire zone numerous times to treat and extract wounded soldiers. He was wounded again by RPG shrapnel and small arms fire. McCloughan again showed his heroism when he volunteered to hold a blinking light in the open while bullets and RPGs hit around him so his company could be resupplied.[[Page S6919]]  McCloughan continued to fight throughout the night and into the morning, knocking out the RPG position and treating numerous soldiers.

Now, logging is a very big business in the State of About 90 percent of our State, Mr.Speaker, is forested, and we have generations and traditions of logging in the State of Logging is often a family-run business where the practice and the technique of harvesting and then transporting saw logs to mills are passed down from one generation to another.

607,topic-id,810,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to talk about a job-killer tax bill that is coming to Congress this week, and if you don't watch out, it could be coming to your hometown soon.  Up until yesterday, Mr.Speaker, I thought the new GOP tax plan was just run-of-the-mill, upside-down class warfare waged by the wealthiest people in the country against everybody else. I knew 80 percent of the windfall of the tax cut would go to people making $912,000 a year or more--the richest 1 percent of the country. I knew it would repeal the alternative minimum tax, the only reason that Donald Trump paid any taxes at all in the 1 year we know he paid taxes over the last few decades in 2005. I knew it would repeal the State and local income tax deduction, which would be terrible news for tens of millions of middle class people in States across the country, including mine in  I knew it would repeal the estate tax which only affects the wealthiest one-half of 1 percent of the country. All of these provisions would help to create a[[Page H8305]]hereditary oligarchical elite like the hereditary oligarchical elite in Russia today.  This huge penthouse suite party will be paid for by the rest of us and blow a record-smashing $2 trillion deficit hole into our economy and programs like Medicare and I knew all of this. It is predictable enough.  But then I noticed a provision yesterday that is absolutely gobstopping, shocking, startling, eye-popping, unbelievable in the GOP tax blueprint. It is called the territorial system, and what it means is simple. We will tax American businesses only when their operations are here in Here is what that means: if I am a businessman and I am going to set up a manufacturing plant on main street in my hometown, I have to pay the full freight of taxes. I pay everything.  If I set my business, my new manufacturing plant, up in Mexico, or Bangladesh, or Ireland, I pay zero taxes. Let me repeat that: if I decide to set up my business in America, I pay 100 percent of the taxes I am going to owe. If I decide to relocate my business and all of the jobs abroad, I will pay zero taxes. That works even if I have already got the business in place here and I decide to ship everything overseas. Suddenly, I get a 100 percent tax break for all the profits that I earn overseas.  Mr.Speaker, perhaps I misunderstand it. I am not a professor of tax law. I am a professor of constitutional law. So maybe I am not interpreting it right. I would love nothing more than for one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle to get up and tell me it is not true, and correct me, and explain what I have got wrong.  But if I have got it right, this shocking provision tucked into the bill that we are about to see is a job killer, a national emergency, and a dagger pointed at the heart of the American economy and our jobs. It is only a few, small, big businesses, a few big businesses that will benefit.  Small businesses are not going to be benefited at all. The small businesses do not set up tax-dodging corporate subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, or the Bahamas, or in They don't ship overseas. So this is for a tiny percentage of the largest corporations in America, leaving the small businesses behind and taking millions of American jobs with them.  Why would the majority do this to us when Donald Trump campaigned on a platform of putting America first and promising to bring American jobs back home--not export millions more with a devastating tax plan?  Now I see why they are hurdling this through In 1986, with the tax reform plan, there were 63 days of hearings, and more than 450 witnesses in Ways and Means and the Senate Finance It took 2 years and 10 months. This plan they want to slam through Congress in less than 2 weeks, with barely any witnesses, maybe no hearings, maybe one or two hearings; and you know why? Because they are tucking the most massive job-killing provision anyone has ever seen into this bill.  If anything, we should be imposing higher taxes on those businesses that ship our jobs overseas--not lower taxes--or they should pay the same. But this plan would wipe out any taxes at all, and it is dumbfounding that they would think this is something that Congress would put up with--just like they tried to slam through Congress the ACA repeal and we stopped it when people got the word.  We have got to make sure, Mr.Speaker, that every American understands what is really in this tax bill coming our way.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8304-2.txt,1E+14,40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAINE COALITION TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,2017,1,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1065,topic-id,5907,"Mr.President, a few weeks ago, I traveled to South Korea to better understand the threat posed by North I would like to share my impressions from the trip and how I believe we should be positioning ourselves to better deal with this current crisis.  I want to recommend to my colleagues and the administration that the time for debate on this issue is now, before the crisis comes to a head. We need to have a clear strategy and increased cooperation with South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia to contain and to deter the nuclear threat posed by North I have significant concerns that we are not doing everything we can right now to improve our bargaining position with North I am convinced we must try to find a diplomatic solution to this problem because the alternatives are extraordinarily costly. While we should always remain prepared to go to war and never take that option off the table, I believe as long as there is a possible diplomatic solution to this crisis, we must make every effort to make it a reality.  I would like to spend some time talking about the threat posed by North Korea and then review the history of our diplomatic negotiations since the early nineties.  North Korea voluntarily joined the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, NPT, in 1985. It was clear only a few years later that it was in violation of the  Our first crisis occurred when Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, refused inspections required under the treaty in 1993. Since then, North Korea has engaged in the illegal production of fissile material and nuclear devices, and has conducted six nuclear weapons tests. The latest test occurred just last month on September 3.  The threat we face from North Korea is not just a nuclear weapon aimed at New York City or Washington, This regime has proven over and over again that it will not hesitate to proliferate weapons of mass destruction for financial gain. The proliferation threat is a global one. We can all imagine the consequences of a nuclear weapon in the hands of al-Qaida or ISIS that can be deployed anywhere in the world.  North Korea poses not only a nuclear threat to the globe but also a conventional one. In 2010, the regime torpedoed and sank a South Korean warship, and 46 South Korean sailors lost their lives. Later that year, the regime killed four South Korean citizens when it shelled Yeonpyeong Once this regime achieves its goal of developing a nuclear weapon that can hit the continental United States, we may see increased kinetic attacks against South Korea and Japan and possibly other countries in the region.  North Korea has repeatedly engaged in cyber attacks over the last decade and uses them as an asymmetric weapon against companies and governments alike. It has been attributed with sweeping attacks against the financial industry's Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication or SWIFT protocol to enrich itself to the tune of millions of dollars. This SWIFT protocol is the backbone of the world financial system.  It orchestrated the DarkSeoul cyber attacks in 2013, attacking South Korean news stations and financial institutions, and it was responsible for the destructive and coercive attacks against Sony Pictures, a successful American entertainment company, because it didn't like a movie's depiction of the current leader.  Let us not forget that North Korea engages in horrific human rights violations against its own people. It maintains a system of brutal prison camps that incarcerate thousands of men, women, and children who live in atrocious living conditions under the constant fear of rape, torture, and arbitrary execution. It keeps its civilian population isolated from the rest of the world without access to current news and information that would undermine its propaganda to brainwash its population into believing in and revering their leader and demonizing the Western ideals of freedom and democracy.  I think it is important for us to remember the long and torturous diplomatic path we have walked with North Korea for the last 25 years and recognize the wasted opportunities by past administrations that could have prevented or reduced the threat we face today.  After we realized that North Korea had failed to meet its obligations under the NPT in the mid-nineties, we almost reached a crisis point in the late spring of 1994, as the Clinton administration considered striking the Yongbyon nuclear facility. The crisis was resolved when former President Carter traveled to Pyongyang that summer and brokered the outlines of a deal. North Korea would freeze its plutonium production program in exchange for a light-water nuclear reactor. A final deal was brokered later that year called the Agreed Framework, under which North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium production programs and to eventually dismantle them in exchange for two nuclear reactors and the prospect of normalization of economic and diplomatic relations.  How did we get from that agreement to today? For starters, in 1998, North Korea tested its first long-range ballistic missile, and that began to unravel the deal. The Clinton administration attempted to salvage the Agreed Framework by negotiating additional terms to stop its missile program but was unable to conclude arrangements before President Clinton left office. After President Bush took office in 2001, the new administration wanted to distance itself from Clinton's policies and stopped negotiating the Agreed Framework in earnest. North Korea, reacting to the Bush administration's new hostile tone, also stepped away from the talks.  For example, in January 2002, President Bush delivered his ``axis of evil'' State of the Union speech that identified North Korea as a regime ``arming [itself] with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.'' In April of that year, President Bush issued a memorandum stating he would not certify North Korea's[[Page S6880]]compliance with the Agreed Rumors also abounded at this time about North Korea's pursuit of a uranium-based nuclear weapon, which were confirmed in October of 2002. By the end of 2002, diplomatic efforts having stalled, North Korea expelled inspectors from the country, withdrew from the NPT in early 2003, and turned fuel rods that the United States had helped to store safely under the Agreed Framework into weapons-grade plutonium. It was a lost opportunity to go back to the drawing board, reengage with the North Korean regime, and attempt to find a comprehensive deal that would include both its plutonium and uranium programs, as well as the missile program.  After North Korea admitted in April 2003 that it possessed nuclear weapons but was willing to get rid of its program in exchange for something ``considerable'' from the United States, the so-called Six-Party Talks started in August of that year and eventually reached an agreement in September of 2005, in which North Korea committed to the other five parties that it would abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.  At this point, North Korea's nuclear program had made significant progress, and forcing the North Korean regime to implement the agreement and stop its program would have required a significant diplomatic investment by the United States, but at that time we were fighting two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and did not see North Korea as the highest priority.  After North Korea tested a nuclear device in 2006, we had a moment when the other parties to the Six-Party Talks were even more resolved to work together. The Six-Party Talks did produce two additional agreements in which North Korea froze the plutonium program, turned over operating records, and dismantled the cooling tower, but they again faltered and then failed over verification measures. It is possible that with consistent pressure and cooperation with the other parties, we could have convinced North Korea to follow through on its verification commitments. Then the North Korean leader suffered a stroke in 2008, and President Bush left office in January 2009, complicating matters even more. North Korea greeted the newly elected Obama administration with a ballistic missile test in April 2009 and a nuclear test in  After Kim Jong Un took control of North Korea in 2011, the situation became even more challenging when it became clear that there was a new and concerted effort to advance their nuclear program. The Obama administration struck the so-called Leap Day Deal--both countries separately announced an agreement to suspend operations at its Yongbyon uranium enrichment plant and invited the International Atomic Energy Agency or IAEA inspectors to monitor the suspension and implement moratoriums on nuclear long-range missile tests. In exchange, we offered a generous food aid package. It was an attempt to begin the process of denuclearization but was short-lived since North Korea announced its plans to launch a satellite in violation of U.resolutions only 2 weeks after the agreement was announced. Yet, again, it was a lost opportunity to really challenge the current leader before he had consolidated power within North Korea over a provocation that did not need to derail negotiations.  My purpose in reviewing this history is to note that there were opportunities, especially under the Agreed Framework and later during the Six-Party Talks, to reengage the North Korean Government and find a comprehensive diplomatic solution.  We missed those opportunities and deferred this problem and now we are in a much worse negotiating position than in any time in history. Of course, we cannot ignore that the biggest problem has always been North Korea's failure to stand by its commitments and its covert development of programs despite repeated assurances during negotiations. That is why I believe we need to make sure any deal includes stringent verification measures, with snapback sanctions and economic measures that will cripple the North Korean economy and starve it of any resources it can use for a nuclear program. While I understand the risks inherent in any deal with North Korea, I believe the alternatives are much riskier.  I would like to be very clear. While we will prevail in a war against North Korea, it will not look like winning. I want to paint for you the very stark and grim reality we will be facing in a conflict against North First, it would and should not be lost on anyone that the United States has never fought against a nuclear-armed state. Even if we were to engage in a preemptive war with North Korea now, it currently has the capability to hit both South Korea and Japan, our main staging areas and where the majority of our troops would be located, with a nuclear weapon. The irony is that by striking first to prevent a nuclear strike against the United States, we would be significantly increasing the likelihood of a nuclear strike against ourselves or our allies.  Even if North Korea does not hit South Korea or Japan with a nuclear weapon, a conventional war would be devastating. Within the first weeks, we would see tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of civilian casualties from the long-range artillery strategically aimed at the 25 million citizens of There are some 250,000 American citizens living in South Korea who would need to be evacuated, mostly from Seoul, while the city is under siege. The United States has never conducted a noncombatant evacuation operation of this scale. It is likely that most U.citizens would not be able to be evacuated within the first week of hostilities, resulting in massive U.civilian casualties in addition to the thousands of our Korean friends who would also lose their lives.  Moreover, either in anticipation of hostilities or in response to a preemptive attack, North Korea will engage in significant cyber operations that will strike at infrastructure throughout the world, including the United Further complicating the scenario is the fact that North Korean cyber operations are conducted outside of its territory, principally in Without any prior agreement with these countries, we would be faced with the difficult decision of how to stop these remote North Korean operations.  Let us also not discount the cascading economic effects of war. The South Korean economy would be in ruins, and shortly thereafter, the Asian markets and the global market would begin to see the effects. As noted by Emerging Asia Economics Focus by Capital Economics with regard to the potential economic impacts of such a war, South Korea accounts for around 2 percent of global economic output. If South Korea's GDP fell only by half, that would result in a 1-percent decrease in global GDP, not to mention a huge disruption to global supply chains. The U.Federal debt would go up considerably. Collectively, this war could cost us billions, in addition to the actual financial and military resources that we would need to expend.  To those who think we will have a quick and certain military victory, I would say that our assumptions of a quick victory have been proven wrong many times in our history. We will not be viewed as liberators by the majority of the North Korean population, who have been taught from birth that the United States initiated the hostilities that led to the Korean war and is determined to destroy their country. The Korean war, during which the North Koreans suffered massive casualties and a constant bombing campaign that reportedly killed almost 20 percent of its population, is within the living memory of older North  Add to that the incredibly risky missions of locating, isolating, and neutralizing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapon sites and the thousands of underground facilities in North Korea and we are looking at a month-long kinetic campaign with a years-long stabilization effort, not to mention the decades it will take not only to reconstruct North Korea but to bring its infrastructure and population forward to the 21st century.  We also cannot underestimate the reactions of the global community, especially China, if we act prematurely. China has a defense treaty with North Korea, and although it has publicly stated that it will not aid North Korea if North Korea attacks first, we cannot gauge what China's reaction will be if it determines that we were the initial aggressors.[[Page S6881]]  Again, we will prevail after a long, bloody, and costly fight, but it will not look like winning. We must do everything we can now to set the theater to win the war, and then do everything in our power to avoid it. To that end, we should exhaust every single diplomatic avenue for peace before considering other options. We have an obligation to our men and women in uniform to vigorously seek a diplomatic solution before using military force. We also need to convince our allies, especially South Korea and Japan, that we are serious about their security and have made every effort to avoid conflict. We will undermine our own credibility and our standing in the world if we rush to war without demonstrating our commitment to peace.  Finally, even if diplomacy fails--and I fear that our likelihood of success is low, given the history I have laid out above--there are certain advantages to being secured solely through the process of negotiating that will be significant achievements in their own right.  First, we will have a much better sense of what the current regime's strategic interests are. It was clear Kim Il Sung, the present leader's grandfather, had three strategic priorities: to use the nuclear program to blackmail the rest of the world for economic concessions; to appeal to the North Korean populace, who had been told that nuclear weapons were a mantle of legitimacy; and to scapegoat the United States with North Korea's economic problems, arguing that the sacrifices made by the North Korean people were necessary to fend off U.imperial aggression.  It is less clear where the current regime's interests lie. It is possible that Kim Jong Un is interested only in regime survival and will be willing to agree to a deal that will freeze its programs and instead focus its attention on developing its infrastructure and improving its economic growth in exchange for guarantees that we will not seek regime change.  Despite our strongest sanctions programme to date, the North Korean economy is growing, albeit from a remarkably low starting point. Kim Jong Un has taken a page from the Chinese economic plan of the 1980s and 1990s and significantly increased the economic prosperity of his people. While maintaining strict social and political control, he has opened the economy through decollectivization, the reduction of market restrictions, and allowing small private enterprises to flourish. The North Korean economy grew more than 3 percent last year. It is clear that Kim Jong Un is interested in allowing his economy to develop and in providing greater economic opportunity to his people.  But it is also possible that Kim Jong Un has more aggressive ambitions and seeks to finish his grandfather's goal of reuniting the peninsula under North Korean rule. I believe we should spend the time to try to understand Kim Jong Un's ultimate goals and whether peace is really on the table.  Second, we will have the moral authority to go to war having demonstrated to the world that we negotiated in good faith and that the North Korean regime is not interested in peace. It will also give us an opportunity to better understand and coordinate on China's strategic interests. While China is also quite concerned and alarmed by the nuclear programs, it has a considerable interest in maintaining stability on the peninsula to avoid regime collapse, to avoid a humanitarian crisis triggered by millions of refugees flowing across its southern border, and to avoid the possibility of a biological or chemical weapon attack or a nuclear attack so close to its territory.  Diplomacy may offer the opportunity to find common ground with China on these issues--issues that concern us as well--and to coordinate our responses in the event of a contingency. We should discuss end states with China that take into account their vital national interests.  Finally, we should be able to receive some commitments from other countries, especially China, with regard to the enforcement of sanctions as an aid to the diplomatic process. To date China has been unwilling to exert the type of pressure necessary to cause real economic pressure on the North Korean regime. I believe we should push for an agreement with China and Russia on even stronger sanctions that will be immediately enforced during the negotiation process and will continue to be enforced if the negotiations fail.  We should be expending every possible resource now to set the right conditions for diplomacy and to improve our negotiation position. This administration has not created the right conditions to date, and there are four areas that I believe we need to focus on today: consistent and clear messaging to North Korea and the world; increasing our diplomatic and military capacity; improving international cooperation and coordination; and increasing pressure on the North Korean regime through better sanctions enforcement, military pressure, and information operations.  There has been a marked failure to consistently message to the North Koreans, our allies in the region, other global players like Russia and China, and the rest of the world. Secretary Tillerson has repeatedly made public statements regarding our intentions to pursue a diplomatic solution with North Korea and has been consistently undercut by the President's commentary that we are not really interested in diplomacy. While I understand the President's intent might be to demonstrate that we can and will use military force if necessary, there are certainly more artful ways of making that message clear than tweeting that the Secretary of State is ``wasting his time trying to negotiate with Rocket Man.''  This is not a time for incoherence or confusion. We need to be as precise and clear as possible with regard to the administration's avowed strong preference for diplomacy.  Likewise, President Trump's speech at the United Nations General Assembly sent exactly the wrong message to North Korea and to our ally South Threatening to destroy North Korea, a country of 25 million people, may send a deterrence message, but it also plays into the regime's narrative that we are out to destroy them. We should not be feeding into Kim Jong Un's propaganda machine by reaffirming their mistaken belief that we are interested in annihilating their country, and we should not be signaling to South Korea that this administration does not take its security seriously.  I sincerely hope that the President does not repeat his tone-deaf messaging during his upcoming speech to the Korean National The Government of Korea needs to hear a clear commitment to diplomacy and a clear commitment to protect the Republic of Korea as is required by our alliance.  In this regard, it is disturbing to hear of reports that officials responsible for executing our diplomacy with regard to North Korea are, as reported in an October 25 Foreign Policy situation report, ``frustrated by an inability to communicate the urgency of the situation to the White House.'' Unless there is consistency in our message and constant and acute attention from the White House, we are on a path to disaster.  In addition to consistent messaging, we need to drastically improve our capacity, both diplomatic and military, to position ourselves for any negotiation with North It is diplomatic malpractice that there is no U.Ambassador to South The President is heading there in a few days. There is insufficient time, even if an Ambassador were to be named tomorrow, to confirm that individual before the President's trip. We have a key diplomatic post that has been empty for 8 months. There is also no Assistant Secretary of State for Asia in the State Department or in the Department of While we have Acting Assistant Secretaries, that is no substitute for the political appointees who will be able to operate with far greater freedom and support from the administration. I urge this administration to fill these positions immediately.  Since sanctions are our most important diplomatic tool, it is also astounding that Secretary Tillerson is eliminating the State Department's Coordinator for Sanction Policy office, ``which has been led by a veteran ambassador-rank diplomat with at least five staff'' as reported in an October 26 Foreign Policy article. He will reportedly entrust this critical task to one individual in his Policy Planning Office.[[Page S6882]]  One of the most important elements to strengthening our bargaining position is demonstrating that we are prepared to fight if necessary. When I was in South Korea, I spoke at great length with our military commanders, including General Brooks, about our readiness. I was very impressed by not only how prepared we are to go to war but also how integrated our operations are with the Republic of Korea's.  Even so, I believe there are some additional measures that should be taken now. Specifically, I believe we need to increase our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations, our strike capabilities, and strengthen our missile defense capabilities in the region with more Patriot, THAAD, and SM-3 interceptors, as well as increase our critical munitions stocks to ensure that we are providing credible military options on the Korean We should be providing U.Forces Korea with every tool they may need to prosecute a possible war. However, even this increased readiness would not overcome the massive casualties and possible use of nuclear weapons that I outlined before.  As we have learned time and time again, the multilateral approach is the best path to a successful outcome, whether in diplomacy or war. There are a number of countries whose national security interests are touched by the North Korean threat, although I would submit that North Korea poses a global challenge because of the risk created by its nuclear weapons and human rights violations.  First and foremost, we need to better coordinate our messaging and strategy with our allies, South Korea and It will be nearly impossible to initiate any unilateral action against North Korea without the commitment and cooperation of South Korea and The majority of our forces are either stationed or flowing through those two countries. They are indispensable and equal partners in the crisis and should be treated as such.  We cannot assume that South Korea and Japan have identical interests to us or that they are in complete agreement on all aspects of our strategy. Through constant diplomacy, we can ensure that we enter into negotiations with the same objectives and understand our partners' interests and their tolerance for risk. We also need to push our partners to work better together. For example, at the end of last year, South Korea and Japan entered into a General Security of Military Information Agreement to share sensitive information on North Korea's missile and nuclear activities. However, this agreement has yet to be implemented, to the detriment of the security of South Korea, Japan, and the United Our allies must learn to work in concert to ensure we are in the best position to deal with the threat we all face.  Second, we should be seriously considering some combination of multiparty talks with the relevant stakeholders, including China and Russia, to first establish some basic redlines that can be conveyed to the North Korean Government: No atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons, no electromagnetic pulse attacks, and no missile attacks on the United States, its allies, or any country. These talks should be also geared toward getting additional commitments on sanctions, especially from China and Russia, that have to date failed to fully implement sanctions against North  If we can come to some agreement among ourselves about the path forward and show a unified, diplomatic front to North Korea, I believe we will be much more successful in any negotiations.  It is also critical that we increase the pressure on North Korea and create less operating space for the regime to pursue its ballistic missile and nuclear ambitions.  We are not at the maximum level of sanctions that can be imposed on North There are financial institutions that are conducting transactions with North Korea that have not yet been subjected to sanctions. We should be pursuing sanctions against every institution, no matter how large or small, that conducts even a single transaction with this regime. There are significant authorities that have been created, both through the United Nations and by other authorities, to go after companies and individuals who are doing business with North The issue, as I see it, is enforcement. Our Treasury Department, in cooperation with the State Department, must act faster to target these bad actors. Time is not on our side. Every day that passes is a day that Kim Jong Un is closer to the goal of achieving an intercontinental ballistic missile that can hit the eastern seaboard of the United States with a nuclear weapon.  In addition to financial institutions, we must starve the regime of the resources it needs to support its elites and the military--whether through coal or overseas labor, every avenue of revenue must be cut off.  We need to make a concerted effort through our diplomatic channels to cut off North Korea's access to hard currency. Every country that continues to employ North Korean labor and allow North Korean business to operate within its borders needs to know that there will be economic and diplomatic consequences for its behavior. To those who argue that we would be punishing everyday North Koreans with these measures, I would note that the vast majority of funds are remitted to the regime to use for its nefarious purposes.  We should be engaging every single country with a North Korean Embassy that has not yet been closed to follow Spain and Mexico's example and order them closed. It has been reported for years that these Embassies operate as fronts for North Korea's illicit activities, including trading in counterfeit currency, arms smuggling, and circumventing sanctions by selling prohibited goods.  China needs to be convinced not only to cut off the fuel supply to North Korea but also to clamp down on the regime's use of its financial institutions. Russia employs thousands of workers and stands ready to sell fuel to North Korea, acting opportunistically instead of as the global leader it makes itself out to be.  The United States withheld nearly $300 million in military assistance to Egypt after we discovered that the military had purchased 30,000 North Korean rocket-propelled grenades.  I believe it is our failure to exact severe consequences on the countries that do business with North Korea that has allowed the regime to spread its workers and exports across the globe and reap billions of dollars from the global economy.  North Korea needs to realize that its reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons has left it with no allies, no friends, and no financial resources. This is one reason why the devastating cuts to the State Department and the failure to adequately staff our diplomatic corps is such a wasted opportunity to increase our diplomatic capacity to spread this message to all the countries that work with North  We need to increase the military pressure on North This requires flying close surveillance missions and continuing our exercises and posture on the peninsula. We need to make it clear to Pyongyang that while we prefer diplomacy, we will not hesitate to use military force if necessary. To that end, we should be doing everything to set the military theater on the peninsula in our favor.  Finally, we have not sufficiently countered the propaganda that has brainwashed the North Korean people into believing that we are their enemies and that we seek to destroy their country. We should be increasing the budgeting for Radio Free Asia and other organizations that everyday North Koreans can access. We should also be exposing the North Korean people, through every avenue available, to real information about the world and the deplorable conditions that their leadership has created within their country.  I believe it was a mistake to do away with the position of Special Envoy for North Korean Human We need more diplomats fully engaged and working on improving the human rights conditions for millions of North Korean citizens, helping North Korean refugees, and increasing efforts to educate them.  We should be just as concerned with internal pressure on the regime as we are with external pressure. The Soviet Union collapsed because everyday Soviet citizens saw how far behind their Western counterparts the USSR's policies had left them. Everyday North Koreans want the same things: security,[[Page S6883]]stability, and the ability to educate and raise their children in peace and prosperity. That is the message we should be promoting in North  I wish I could stand here and say that I am confident we can negotiate a deal with the North Koreans to denuclearize the Korean This may have been possible in the late 1990s under the Agreed Framework, but it will be very challenging now. The price of peace has risen dramatically since that time. Administration after administration kicked the can down the road, and now we are left with a North Korean regime that is very close to developing a nuclear-armed ICBM that can hit the United States and a North Korean leader who observed the fates of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi and has decided that his regime will only survive if he has a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United  We may need to be willing to accept a deal short of denuclearization that includes a verifiable freeze on the development and testing of nuclear weapons and missile programs. We will likely need to have some interim confidence-building agreements over a period of months or years short of this goal to build momentum. Obtaining the necessary agreements regarding verification and inspections will be the most challenging aspects of the deal and I worry may derail our best efforts at negotiation.  There will likely be discussion of reducing our military presence on the peninsula and curtailing our joint military exercises with the Republic of I believe we should not agree to any reduction of joint exercises in exchange for a freeze, but I do think we should carefully consider whether there should",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be a step down in military exercises on both sides to reduce tensions and build confidence.  Any agreement will need to contain strict prohibitions on proliferation and an international observation organization to ensure that North Korea is not selling its nuclear or missile technology to other countries or nonstate actors.  It is important that we all recognize that we are not faced with the binary options that many people are fond of promoting--denuclearization or war. There are diplomatic options short of denuclearization that we may be forced to consider. If diplomacy fails, our only alternative is not a kinetic one. There is the same option we chose when Russia and China became nuclear states--accept the risks and mitigate it through isolation, containment, and deterrence.  I would like to note that the costs associated with this path are very high but still likely less than the cost of war. There is a significantly lower risk of the loss of life.  For example, we will need to invest even more heavily in our missile defense, and even after investing millions of dollars, we are left in a position where we won't have confidence that we can shoot down every single missile pointed at Washington, DC, or New That is where we were with the Soviet Union and still are with the Russians today.  We will also need to increase our funding for overhead intelligence to make sure we have the most accurate information, minute by minute, about developments within North  Additionally, we will need to maintain a strictly enforced sanctions regime for years to come, and we will need to work diligently to overcome the inevitable sanctions fatigue.  We will also need to invest even more heavily in our agencies that prosecute sanctions. We will need a nimble Treasury, State Department, and intelligence community that can identify and quickly target bad actors. The North Korean regime has proven itself quite able to engage in illegal and illicit activities as varied as cyber crime, arms sales, currency, counterfeiting, narcotics, and wildlife trafficking. Empowering our State, Treasury, and intelligence Departments to identify and target these illicit activities and schemes will be expensive, both in manpower and diplomatic negotiations with countries that stand to profit from these arrangements.  We will also need to work hard to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Asia-Pacific region. There are already elements in South Korea that are agitating for the return of tactical nuclear weapons. As North Korea's nuclear program grows more robust, these elements will only get stronger. Even nuclear-adverse Japan may reconsider its position as it feels more pressure from its neighbor to the west. The risks of proliferation in Asia and the rest of the world are high. Let us remember that proliferation is not the solution, it is the problem.  We need to be clear-eyed about the threat we face from North Years of indecision have left us with a number of imperfect and expensive options. North Korea's aggressive behavior has led us to the brink of war. We are in a time of uncertain peace.  I would urge this administration and my colleagues to consider the costs of war that I have outlined and for all of us, Republicans and Democrats," to work toward a peaceful and diplomatic solution to this crisis now.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________""",CREC-2017-10-30-pt1-PgS6879-4.txt,1982,AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The founders of October's Small Business of the Month demonstrate that, with determination and hard work, there is no limit to what can be accomplished. I am honored to recognize an enterprise that makes it their business to help other businesses experience growth and prosperity of their own. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to recognize TelStar Associates, Inc., as the Senate Small Business of the Month for October 2017.  TelStar was founded in 1979 by Jose Telleria and Douglas Stark, who decided to join together and use their individual strengths and experience in the field of information technology to create their own business. The company name, TelStar, is a combination of the names of its founders and represents the partnership between Telleria--Tel--and Stark, For their first contract, TelStar developed a software program that tracked the storage and shipping of onions for Murakami Within a short period of time, TelStar was providing their services to a diverse range of clients in both the private and public sectors, including the Idaho Governor's Office, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, the Idaho National Laboratory, and Boise State TelStar also developed a chemical management and waste disposal management application that is currently used by the U.In addition to being an invaluable asset to their community, TelStar exemplifies the entrepreneurial spirit by continually adapting to the needs of their clients.  As leaders in the IT field, Jose and Douglas created a business known for flexibility and for consistently providing meaningful services. Responding to the changing needs of businesses, TelStar expanded their services from custom contract programming to network support, field services, cyber security, and IT staffing services. TelStar provides their clients with access to affordable services that allow them to improve their IT capabilities. In an increasingly technological world, small businesses have the opportunity to benefit from businesses like Jose and Douglas's. I know the technological challenges businesses can face, which is why I am proud to recognize TelStar, a successful business that is committed to helping other businesses achieve success of their own, by empowering them to be the best at what they do. Since their first contract for Murakami Produce, TelStar has exemplified the innovative nature of many American small businesses.

258,topic-id,610,"Madam Speaker, I would like to start by saying I am heartbroken and shocked by the terror attack in New York this week. This atrocious act of hatred and violence has no place in this country, and we must make it clear that we will not stand for it.  I offer my sincere condolences to every single person who has been impacted by this senseless tragedy. My family and I will be in prayer for everyone who has been hurt by this act, whether physically or emotionally.  I also want to thank law enforcement officers who responded so quickly, who saved lives and apprehended the suspect. As scary as this incident was, we can all be reassured by the courage and professionalism of our law enforcement, the military, and the intelligence community that work together to keep our country safe.  Madam Speaker, it has been a busy 10 months here in the House of We have passed more than 360 bills this year alone in a unified effort to deliver on our promises to the American people. Of course, many of those bills are aimed at rolling back the Big Government policies of the Obama era. So I would like to say we are doing a lot to make sure that the Federal Government does less.  As a limited government conservative, I am especially glad that we have taken action to return some of Washington's bureaucratic power to the American people. The last 7 years saw the emergence of a regulatory state that never stopped in its mission to grab power and impose its will at the expense of everyday This town is overrun with Federal agencies and departments where bureaucrats sit around every day concocting rules and regulations that might sound like a good idea but, in reality, end up weighing down businesses, destroying jobs, and limiting freedom.  In his 8 years, President Obama added 18,000 pages to the Federal Register, amounting to 6 pages added every day that he held office. This habit costs American households roughly $15,000 per year, each.  While President Obama is no longer in office, his regulatory state is alive and well, but not for long. Madam Speaker, the people of Alabama elected me to help put an end to that, and I am proud to report that is exactly what we are doing. The House is changing the game because the American people deserve better than to pay for unnecessary Big Government mandates. We have utilized the Congressional Review Act to strike 15 Federal regulations that were imposed by executive action.  What kind of regulations?  One extended intrusive, overreaching, and punitive environmental penalties on energy companies, costing tens of thousands of jobs, but not anymore.  One attempted to force State and local schools to use Washington's preferred teacher preparation programs, undermining local control--not anymore.  One restricted States' ability to enforce existing laws stopping otherwise able-bodied drug abusers from receiving unemployment benefits--not anymore.  One attempted to take away the Second Amendment rights of millions of Americans without due process by arbitrarily restricting Social Security disability beneficiaries from purchasing firearms--not anymore.  Finally, one attempted to force States to steer millions in Title X funding to abortion provider Planned Parenthood, even over the State's objections--not anymore, thank  These rules no longer exist because this Congress, working together with the Trump administration, struck them one by one. In all, 15 bills rolling back these Big Government policies have been passed and signed into law.  Madam Speaker, I am proud of the work the House of Representatives has done, and I hope it can give us momentum for tackling more pressing issues like tax reform and infrastructure.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8391.txt,1986,PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2017,2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

636,topic-id,2107,"Mr.Speaker, our American way of life and our Judeo-Christian values are under attack as never before. People understand that there is the threat out there, but perhaps the magnitude keeps coming home of how bad and what a great threat it really is.  Radical Islamic terrorists with a backward, evil, 7th century view of the world are out to destroy and kill us. They seek to terrorize Western countries and Americans, in particular, into retreat.  Well, instead, we must stand tall. We must have the courage to do what is necessary because it does depend on us, as it always has been. As when Nazism and Japanese militarism threatened the world, it was the United States that carried the day for the decent people of the world.  When communism threatened to establish atheistic dictatorships throughout the world and was on the march, yes, it was the American people who stood strong and had those policies necessary to hold off the communist menace until it collapsed, basically, of its own inconsistencies and its own evil nature.  Well, we had great leadership at those other battles, and I say, thank goodness that today we now have a President who actually can speak the words against and condemn this horrible force that threatens our country and the people of the world.  Yes, we have a President who can actually say those words, ``radical Islamic terrorism.'' For 8 years, we had a President who couldn't use those words, much less do those things that were necessary to defeat this threat and to make sure our people were secure.  Some, if not many, of our leaders have been afraid to confront the basic nature of those who have made repeated terrorist attacks and assaults. Anyone who is not signing on to their fanatical religious agenda becomes a terrorist target, not only Christians, but Jews and other  President Trump is, at long last, providing the courageous leadership in this historic battle. Congress needs to support our We need to stand with him and to stand united against this evil, and yes, defend ourselves. We must not be afraid, and we must not only defend ourselves but also do what is necessary to defeat and extinguish this ghoulish adversary and end his bloody assault on Western civilization, and yes, on moderate  Words are not enough. Our homeland is under attack; people are in danger; our families, our country, and our way of life are under attack. These attackers come from many countries, both men and women. But in common--these people who have been murdering people and the mayhem they have been creating throughout the Western world, whether it is in France or in the United States or elsewhere, these men and women who participate in these evil acts of terrorism have something that they have in common. They all pledge allegiance to radical  That is our enemy, not Islam, not Islam itself, but the radical fanaticism that terrorists and the Islamic psychopaths that are out there murdering in the worst possible and ghoulish ways, people, in order to--yes, in order to have--to shock us and in order to intimidate the West into retreat.  This week, a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant plowed a truck into people walking and cycling in a New York City pathway. He killed 8 people, and he proclaimed that he was inspired by In fact, he said he was proud of what he had done and even requested the display of his Islamic state flag in his hospital room.  We need to ask ourselves: Why are we allowing Islamic terrorists like this into our country in the first place? How much longer will we close our eyes and bury our heads in the sand?  We have even witnessed horrendous terrorist attacks even in my home We know that. We have seen it. On December 2, 2015, in San Bernardino, 14 innocent and wonderful people were brutally slaughtered and 22 seriously injured by an immigrant from Pakistan--a hotbed of radicalism. And yes, his motive was his fanatic belief in what he considers to be It was truly one of the most evil attacks in our State's history.  In Orlando, on June 12, 2016, 49 nightclubbers out having a good time, enjoying themselves as Americans--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--they were having a good time, and 49 of these nightclubbers were brutally murdered and mowed down.  All of these innocent lives were slaughtered. Americans who were blown apart at the Boston marathon is no different.  We have American victims staring us in the face saying: What are you going to do to bring justice and to protect the Americans that we left behind, our families? These horrific crimes of cowards mirrors what has happened to innocent people throughout the world.  Yes, we Americans are suffering. And as I say, we have seen it in France, we have seen it in Europe, we have seen it in Muslim countries where these fanatics take Christians out and behead them. But they also, of course, attack moderate They are out to try to topple the government of el-Sisi and Egypt and all the other governments there that are not committed to the fanatic view of Islam that they hold.  The most recent attacks in New York should, at least, open our eyes to things that we can do here. Maybe we can't stop it all over the world, but the least we can do is to take steps to protect our own citizens from this type of fanatical threat that hangs over us.  Well, we need to take specific steps that can and should be done to help deal with this danger. I have, in fact, discussed a plan with the President--and this is a few months ago--and we have had a lot of work and a lot of things under the bridge since then, but his commitment to border security includes placing a wall on the Southern border.  Yes, making sure that we have border security, and yes, if it takes a wall on our Southern border, the President is right on target. A wall and beefing up our border will, of course, be expensive. That is why I laid out a plan to the President and have since offered legislation that would pay for President Trump's proposed border wall.  The car attack in New York has altered many Americans and alerted many Americans to something they didn't know about before, and that is that we have an immigration system, an immigration law that permits 50,000 people to immigrate into our country every year--50,000 people who are chosen by lottery, not by some really looking at them, some examination of their credentials, seeing what they could contribute, no. A lottery.  And, of course, Senator Schumer in the Senate, I guess, was the man who actually insisted on this. Well, I am sure he was well-intended, but what we have now are people--instead of bringing in the people who can most contribute to our country, he has insisted we leave 50,000 of them up to a lottery system.[[Page H8439]]  This is insanity. It is forced onto us and has been forced into policy by liberal left politicians who would flood our country with illegals, which is something they are doing besides just this threat that we are talking about, because these people who win the lottery, of course, are not coming here illegally.  At the same time, the same people who are pushing that type of system are pushing for policies that would flood our country with illegals and has flooded our country with illegals, that has brought down our healthcare system, our education system. We brought criminals into our country, and we have had an uncontrolled border.  Yes, the people who are responsible for that have also been responsible for policy that just permitted 50,000 people legally to come here; and those 50,000 people are people not selected by a rational process but instead by a lottery.  The terrorist murderers in New York, of course, were here. That terrorist murderer, and maybe murderers, they were here on the lottery visa. They weren't here because they had been selected. In fact, the lottery selected this Uzbeki fanatic Muslim, and he didn't have the skills and the education necessary to live a decent life, and he ended up killing a lot of people in New Surprise, surprise.  We should know about these people who are coming into our country, period, whether those people are coming illegally. We have had millions of people pouring into our country illegally, and then what do our liberal left politicians on the other side say? ``Oh, we need sanctuary cities to protect them, the ones who are here illegally and have come here illegally,'' which, of course, does nothing but encourage more people to come here illegally. And the more who are here illegally are people who we don't know what they are all about.  Do you think the fanatic Islamic terrorists that I am referring to today didn't notice that our border was porous and that people were pouring across our border from our Southern border?  Well, we should know about everybody who is coming into the country, and we should choose the very best people who can contribute to our country. I have no problem with a very robust legal immigration into our country, no problem at all, and neither do the Republicans that I know.  What we have a problem with is a flood of illegals coming in, bidding down the wages of our own citizens, some of them criminals attacking and killing the citizens like we saw in San Francisco--a young lady who was killed by an illegal who had been sent home. But also, even within the system that is legal immigrants, we need to know who those people are and select the very best people to come here.  The plan that I offered the President, which will make it easier for him to accomplish this mission, is a plan that would take that slot in our lottery, 50,000 people who now come in under a lottery like the guy who just killed those people in New York, instead, let's use that slot, those 50,000 places in our legal immigration system and offer it to foreigners who are very wealthy, who can be given the privilege of paying $1 million each to come here and eventually become a citizen.  If we can do that, that $1 million and those 50,000 slots will give us all the money we need to build that wall, and it is fitting that we build that wall and we secure our borders and beef up our system of immigration to protect our citizens, and that we actually have people who want to come here and immigrate here pay for that reform.  We need to implement immigration policies that serve the American people. That is what should be first and foremost, not some crazy notion that we are going to, oh, build--get some kind of better spirit by opening up the immigration into our country to anybody who can get here, and let's let a lottery decide, let's not do it rationally.  We need to make sure everybody who comes here is going to contribute, and they are good people. Unless we can all stand together--and the most important thing is they are coming here because they want to be Americans, like almost all the legal immigrants who come here, people who want to be Americans, and we will open our arms, as we have, and as Republicans who are opposed to illegal immigration have said over and over again.  Well, I have proposed H.2724, and I call on President Trump to pay attention to this. I call all of my colleagues to pay attention to this. I urge my colleagues to take a look at that legislation. That will offer us the financial resources we need to bolster our borders, to make sure that there is a wall, but, also, to make sure that we are not bringing into this country people who are associated with radical Islamic fanaticism that would do us harm.  I am asking my colleagues to look at that legislation. I am asking anyone who is reading the Congressional Record or listening to this, perhaps, to talk to their Congressman on this issue.  Now, in the past 2 weeks, we have been provided information on another issue that I would like to bring up. Mr.Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 16 minutes remaining.                              {time}  2000  ",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8438.txt,979,PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2017,2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
637,topic-id,1677,"Mr.Speaker, I will try to bring up something that we have heard, and we need to discuss this as Americans, because it also is about a very major flaw in our system that is apparent, things that have been not right for the last 2 years.  In the past 2 weeks, however, information has been provided to the American people that has exposed the hypocrisy and misinformation, forced down our throats, for months concerning the allegation that President Trump colluded with the Russians in order to steal the last election. Over and over again, fake news filled the airwaves and, of course, the newspapers, suggesting that there was a sinister plot that kept Hillary from becoming President of the United  The core accusation was the Russians had hacked into the Democratic National Committee computers. Emails between the Democratic leaders were taken and handed over to Julian Assange, who is the head of WikiLeaks, and that they were released to the public by  The skulduggery of the Democrat leadership and the Clinton campaign was, thus, exposed by these emails. Yes, that exposure to this skulduggery and this unconscionable activity between the Clinton leadership, and also the Democratic Party leadership, these emails, yes, did have an impact on the election, as many Democrats who supported Bernie Sanders felt that they had been cheated by their own party because the proof was being offered to them by these WikiLeaks emails that had been taken from the Democratic National  Now, we heard over and over again that Trump stole the election because he was in collusion with the The lib-left media, which is most of them, found every which way, any little thing that any member of the Trump team did, as sinister proof that there was collusion with the Russians, thus, they stole the election. Well, it was pounded into our heads month after month, even after the election was over.  But Hillary didn't lose that. That is what we are being told. Hillary lost the election. She didn't want us to believe that it was because she was a rotten candidate running on a miserable track record and a platform that undermined her own candidacy, but, instead, she lost because the GOP had subterfuge and treachery in which they were working with Russians, who helped them out to accomplish this horrible crime of stealing the election.  Well, this negative media barrage and this continued attack on President Trump did not stop when the election was over. It went on for months and months. Everybody should remember that. Month after month after the election, in what appeared to be, in my point of view, an effort to disrupt our new President's authority and to exercise powers granted to him by the American voters, that was going to be disrupted, so he could not become a regular President of the United States, as our election process had determined. Talk about not being loyal to the American way of life.  After months of these obstructionist tactics, the American people are now learning the whole truth. They are learning that the attack on Trump was[[Page H8440]]a total fraud, a power grab by those who lost the election, and an attempt to distract the American people from this wrongdoing.  First and foremost, let's make it clear: the Russians did not hack into and steal the Democratic National Committee's emails. In terms of the collusion with the Russians, it is now coming to light there are far worse things. But the stealing of those emails and then making them public--and, by the way, they were just making public honest emails. We are not talking about giving the public false information. We are talking about giving them information the Democrats didn't want them to have.  But in terms of collusion with the Russians, what is coming to light is that the Clinton Foundation--so these other charges that we have heard about President Trump may be something to distract us about something that was being done that was wrong and, of a similar light, that was wrong and being done by Hillary Clinton and her family.  In terms of collusion with the Russians, it has come to light that the Clinton Foundation collected more than or around $150 million from Russian oligarchs that Clinton felt was deposited right into the Clinton Foundation coffers. These oligarchs then deposited $500,000 right into the Clinton family's pockets for a speech. Yeah, they are going to give them a speaker's fee of $500,000 for one speech. All of this was happening when Hillary was Secretary of It was also happening when our government was making a decision as to whether they should sell 20 percent of America's uranium reserves to Why we would never seriously consider that, I don't know.  But in my research, I have found evidence that, because that did not seem right, the FBI had an informant watching all of this go down, close up, right there in Russia--an informant. Instead of charging Hillary with a crime, which was not done by the FBI, a gag order was placed on this witness who was working as an informer for the  That gag order at the time, who put it on this witness?

But I have always felt whatever we do with the Russians needs to be what is in the interest of the people of the United Certainly giving away 20 percent of America's uranium reserves, and then gagging one of the witnesses to the discussions that were taking place at the time when, at the same time, oligarchs in Russia were providing the Clintons with $150 million donation to their foundation, and a $500,000 donation right into the personal pockets of Bill  Now, we need to move forward on this. As we know, the special prosecutor, Mr.Mueller, who kept the gag order on this witness, who didn't charge Hillary in the beginning, now has found someone to indict. Paul Manafort has been indicted.  Isn't this interesting?  Our special prosecutor was tasked with trying to see if there was Russian collusion in the last election between the Trump people and the Russians in order to steal the election. And what did he come up with?  Basically, tax evasion by Paul Manafort, who is a longtime politico in this city.  And guess what. The tax evasion he is being charged with happened long before Paul Manafort had anything to do with Donald That is wrong. That is wrong. There is something really wrong there. We need to get a new special prosecutor or whatever. We need to have these hearings. Our Republicans need to get tough and we need to make sure that we are seeking out this information and documenting it.  For example, putting the people under oath. There were a group of people--policymakers--who made the decision of whether or not to sell that uranium to the They need to be put under oath and asked whether or not anyone representing the Clintons ever talked to them during that process and encouraged them for this deal of selling the Russians this uranium.  There are all kinds of avenues that we need to follow through on. Instead, Mr.Mueller ends up with some kind of a tax violation by one of the players that happened long before he was even associated with Donald  Something has gone haywire here. The American people need to see it. Especially when we understand now there is also evidence that during that election, the Clinton campaign paid Russian sources--it went through an intermediary. He was an English intelligence officer--paid millions of dollars to the Russians to get a scurrilous false report and video, or tape, or whatever it was, of President Trump in some type of compromising situation.  But we know now that was false and that Hillary Clinton's campaign and these people talking about collusion with the Russians were paying, essentially, the Russians to give them this information.  Now, I would hope that this comes out and this becomes something that is explained and the American people understand. When they see this attack on our President by people who have a totally different view of how we should be in the world--remember, our last President could not say the words ``radical Islamic terrorist.'' He had a different approach than Hillary, the Secretary of We know what happened in Benghazi and elsewhere. We have a totally different approach to these challenges America faces overseas. It is all right.  President Obama was elected. Hillary was not elected. President Trump was elected. These efforts to undermine his authority are the worst kind of repudiation of the American way of life and the American system of government. We Americans must stand firm against radical We must stand firm and offer an alternative of strength and courage, as compared to the cowardice and nonsense that we have seen in the policies of the last 8 years.

298,topic-id,2661,"Mr.President, tomorrow the House will announce its plan for tax reform as a starting point. I doubt everybody here will agree with everything that is in it, but I imagine we will find a lot of good in it, and it will be a good starting point for this debate. But it actually is about a broader[[Page S6911]]topic that I hope will be a part of our conversation about tax reform because it hasn't been enough of a part of our national discourse over the last 20 years.  When we think about the history of this country, one of the things that truly distinguishes us is not that we have rich people. Every country in the world has rich people. We have an extraordinary amount of success. We have earned success in this country, and we celebrate it; we don't criticize it. But every society in the world has rich people.  Sadly, we are also not the only country that has people who are poor, who are struggling. That is something that challenges our principles, as a nation founded on the idea of equal opportunity to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But the one thing that really distinguishes America is that, by and large, the overwhelming number of Americans do not consider themselves to be either rich or poor; they consider themselves to be hard-working people. We can come up with any term we want, whether it is middle class or working class, but these are basically people who work hard every single day to provide not just a better life for themselves--to be able to retire with dignity and leave their children better off than themselves. They take pride in that. What they value is not how much money they make or how many things they own; it isn't even the title of the job. They value the dignity that comes from the work they do, and, more importantly, they value what it allows them to do, and it is not complicated things. It allows them to own a home in a neighborhood that is safe--not a mansion, but a home. We see that every weekend. People spend countless hours to constantly keep up the home that they take great pride in, and they take great pride in their children and their churches and their synagogues and their religious organizations and the voluntary groups that they belong to. This has been the fundamental core of our country.  That does not mean that others who do not fit that profile are not important to the country, as well, but it is what distinguishes us because most countries in the world don't really have that. In most societies in human history, you are either rich or poor. There are a lot of poor people and a handful of people in whom all of the wealth is concentrated. That sort of dynamic is what has separated us from the rest of the nations on Earth and, to this day, in many ways still does.  This is something I talk about not because I read about it or because I saw a documentary about it last weekend, but because, in many ways, I lived it. My parents were that. Neither one had much of an advanced education. I don't know how far my dad went in school--probably not beyond third or fourth grade; my mom, perhaps not much more than that. They actually came to this country and barely spoke any English when they arrived. They had to struggle to learn it, but they did. They ended up being a bartender and a maid. People who know me or who have heard me speak before know that story. It is one I tell not because I want you to know more about me but because I want you to understand what motivates me in public policy.  Even though my dad worked in the service sector his entire life and my mother did as well, they owned a home and they retired with dignity. All four of their kids went to college. That was possible through a combination of things: jobs that paid enough and the ability to have programs like Social Security and Medicare that allowed them to retire with dignity--programs they paid into all of the years they were working.  The reason I raise this is that people who fit that profile have been hurt more than anyone else over the last 15 to 20 years. It is not necessarily anyone's fault. The economy has changed. For example, the jobs my parents once did don't pay nearly enough to afford today what they could afford back then. As a bartender and a maid today--if my parents were doing that now, I am not sure what house they would buy in Miami-Dade County, where I live. I am not sure they would be able to buy one anywhere near where we live now, not because our neighborhood is some fancy place but because everything costs so much compared to how much those jobs paid then.  So everything costs more, the jobs aren't paying enough, and then they were hit with the recession. That is just the nature of changes in our economy. Many people lost their jobs altogether. The industry they were once in vanished. It went to another country or machines took their place or they just don't need as many people as they used to because they are able to do more with fewer employees.  Then they were hit with this recession, and it really hit them badly. Maybe it wiped out their retirement savings; it cut in half the value of their home, the most important investment they have, and to this day they haven't fully recovered.  Then you add to all of that the idea that in American politics today, we spend an extraordinary amount of time debating how we can help everyone else except for them. I don't think we do that on purpose or that people around here don't care about people like that. I don't know why it happens; I am just telling you that it has.  The result is somewhat of a little bit of resentment, but certainly there is a sense of isolation and the notion and the belief that they have been left behind. They are upset about it, and they have a right to be. It is not just about money, and it is not just about economics; it is about the values of hard work and dignity and responsibility and doing what you need to do to be a good citizen of this country and contribute to its future but also doing what you need to do to raise your family and instill in them the values you think are important.  I think it would be a terrible mistake to enter into tax reform--perhaps one of the most meaningful public policy debates we will have had in this city, certainly in the time I have been here and perhaps for the better part of two to three decades in terms of our economy--without in any way talking about what tax reform means for the millions of Americans I just described. The one thing it should mean is that for those jobs that have left, some of them should be able to come back because, frankly, our own policies have forced some of those jobs to go somewhere else. When other countries are making it easier to open up factories and create jobs over there instead of over here, we are going to lose some of those jobs. I am not saying all of them were a result of that, but a lot of them were. If we have tax policies, as we do, that do not allow us to compete and create those jobs here, we have to reverse that.  Tax reform should be about that, but it also has to be about working Americans--not Americans who are rich and can hire fancy accountants and lawyers and even lobbyists to help them create special tax statuses. I am not talking about Americans who are depending on government programs. I am not talking about disability or Medicare or Social Security--programs they have paid into; I am not talking about programs that assist anti-poverty programs--a whole other topic that we should talk about one day because some of them aren't working the way we hoped they would in terms of helping people escape poverty. I am talking about people who work and they make just enough to not qualify for any of that stuff but not nearly enough to afford the cost of living. That is just them. You add to that the cost of raising those children. It is more expensive to raise kids today than ever before, and the costs keep going up, and the paychecks are not keeping pace.  There is nothing we can do in tax reform by itself that solves all of those problems, but there is no way we can do tax reform without addressing the millions of Americans who feel as though every time there is a debate in Washington, it is about helping everyone else except for them.  Take, for example, the issue of the child tax credit, which is called the child tax credit, but it really is about helping families--parents and children. Take, for example, a married couple with two children. Let's say one of them works in a warehouse and the other one is a home health aide. These are not unusual jobs to find in the economy.  Let's say, based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics, their annual income combined is going to be around $55,000 a year. Depending on where you live--that is not a lot of money probably[[Page S6912]]anywhere in the country, and it certainly isn't a lot of money where I am standing now or where I am living now in If we do the whole framework on tax reform but do nothing on the child tax credit and leave it as it is, that couple making $55,000 with two children--if we do nothing--they are going to have a tax increase of $738. I cannot imagine a single person here voting for a tax reform package that does nothing on the child tax credit and thereby raises taxes on a couple making $55,000 a year with two children by a penny, not to mention $700 a year.  What if we do a little less, as some people are suggesting? Let's just raise the tax credit to $500, but let's not make it refundable against payroll tax. They will get a tax cut of about $263. When you compare that to some of the tax cuts we are going to see in other parts of this tax reform, I would say that is not nearly enough, certainly not enough to make a difference.  But what if you do this: What if we double the value of the tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and make it refundable toward payroll tax? That couple with those two children will have a tax cut of $1,263. That doesn't solve all of their problems, but it makes a difference.  I can give other examples. Others we will get to in the weeks to come and the days to come, but let's just take a family like the one I grew up in--a bartender and a maid. The median income of the bartender and the maid is about $42,000, $43,000 a year. They have three children. Without anything in the child tax credit--we just leave it the way it is and do the framework--they are going to pay $1,276 more in taxes. Can you imagine a tax reform plan that raises taxes on a bartender and a maid with three children, making $43,000 a year, and it raises their taxes by almost $1,300 a year? Who here is going to vote for that? I dare you. You won't. Actually, I don't dare you. I don't want you to vote for that. That is not what we are going to do.  So let's just do this symbolic thing: Raise it by $500 and make it nonrefundable. They will get a tax cut of about the same--$233. You might as well keep it because it won't make any difference. But what if we doubled the value of the child tax credit and made it refundable toward payroll tax. Then, their tax cut is $1,733. That is a tax cut. That is the direction we have to go.  I have heard some people say we shouldn't make it refundable to payroll tax because that is just more people who aren't paying anything in taxes. They are talking about the income tax. That is the way people here talk and think. That is the way economists think and the way accountants might think. But for the people who work and get a paycheck every week or every two weeks, when they get that paycheck, it shows that money came out of their paycheck. It doesn't matter if that money went into income tax or payroll tax; that is money they earned that you took away, using the power of government. They are paying taxes. Whether they are paying income tax or payroll tax, they are paying taxes. If you want to help people who are working but who don't make enough, then the only way--and they are trying to raise a family--the child tax credit is the best way to do it.  So as we move forward, I truly hope that some of these voices I hear, treating the child tax credit as some sort of welfare program or giveaway or gimmick, well, reconsider that attitude. Reconsider that attitude because the child tax credit applies only to families who are working, who make less than a certain amount of money, and who are raising children, our future taxpayers.  I am going to ask this: If our Tax Code does not help working families, given all the other challenges they face, how--that is inexcusable. How can we pass tax reform that is loaded up on how we are going to help the business sector--and it should, because it creates jobs and it will have higher pay down the road and billions upon billions of dollars to help the poor--but do nothing for the backbone of our economy, the one thing we all say that we take extraordinary pride in, the working class, the working people of this country? There is no way we can have a tax plan that doesn't do those things--no way. If we do head in that direction, that will convince millions of Americans that they were right all along, that the people in charge of this country, in both parties, and the people who advise them don't care about, look down on, and have no idea about what life is like for people like them, who work hard every day, who seek nothing from the government other than a fair chance. That is all they want.  All I am advocating for is that we allow them to keep more of their own money so that they can provide for their families and a better future and rebuild those working-class values and that working-class backbone that I believe are what has made America so great.  I look forward to continuing to work in this direction. We better do something real, and we better do it right; otherwise, I don't know how we pass tax reform. I am hopeful that is where we are headed. I know we still have some work to do, and I know tomorrow is only a starting point. But I will repeat, once again, any tax plan that doesn't cut taxes for working families with children is not one worth supporting. I hope that is the direction in which we will move.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-10-31-pt1-PgS6908-2.txt,2084,"TRIBUTE TO GEORGE STEVENS, JR.",2017,31,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For five decades, Bob continued to work with the New Haven Fire Department with training and guidance, whenever needed. On May 6, 2017, at the department's 50th anniversary, Bob was presented with an honorary membership. This follows the honorary membership he received from the Vergennes Fire Department in 1982.  Bob joined the Ferrisburgh Volunteer Fire Department in 1968, where he was soon promoted to the rank of captain. In 1970, recognizing his dedication and leadership, the department elected him chief, a position he held for 19 years. Bob remained very active after stepping down as chief, spending countless hours working with successive chiefs, passing on knowledge and expertise to help maintain a professional and highly trained department with well-maintained equipment. His service was deservedly recognized this past summer, when the Ferrisburgh Fire Department took delivery of a brand-new frontline engine and dedicated it in honor of Chief  Bob has been a mentor to many other chiefs and firefighters throughout Addison County, as well as the State of He served on numerous committees of the Addison County Firefighters Association, including Sergeant at Arms at the annual business meeting and awards banquet. He was presented with life membership to the association in 1993. He also served for many years as an instructor for the annual Addison County Regional Fire School, which draws firefighters from around Vermont, New York, and In 1994, the 24th Annual Regional Fire School was dedicated to Bob for his commitment to the training program.  Bob also served as an instructor for the Vermont State Firefighters' Association and is a charter member of the Vermont Fire Academy training center in He is passionate about teaching young firefighters all aspects of the fire service, from today's firefighting skills to department history. His expertise in building construction has been particularly important during training and has helped keep many Vermont firefighters safe during fire calls. He also teaches respect for what firefighters do, for fellow members, for leadership, and for our communities. In return, he has gained the respect of his fellow firefighters for his willingness to share his time and knowledge.  Bob's community service does not stop with firefighting. He has served the town of Ferrisburgh in many different ways, including overseeing construction of a new firestation in 1993, overseeing the construction of a new town highway facility in 2015 to 2016, and serving on the town select board, as well as projects for the North Ferrisburgh Methodist  The bottom line is that Bob Jenkins has unselfishly protected and served his community for 55 years. He is a model for what leadership is about. We must keep in mind that Bob did not do this alone. He had the commitment and understanding of his wife of 52 years, Mary Jane; his daughter, Robin; his son, Chris; and his stepsons, Tim, Mark, and Ricky--even when Bob spent time away from home, missing family dinners, family outings, birthdays, holidays, and school events.  I will finish with some words from New Haven Assistant Chief Dean Gilmore: ``If you add Bob's love for his family, his love for his community, and his love for his fellow firefighters; his family's love for him, and his fellow firefighters; his fellow firefighters' love for him and his family; his community's love for him, his family, and his fellow firefighters; we have one powerful feeling in our hearts that is everlasting.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-31-pt1-PgS6919-3.txt,1010,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017,31,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1028,topic-id,732,"Mr.President, let me begin by pointing out an op-ed that appeared in the Boston Globe today. It is an op-ed that I wrote. It is called ``The health care crisis no one is talking about.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, 31, 2017]       The Health Care Crisis No One Is Talking About                          (By Bernie Sanders)       The United States faces a major crisis in primary health      care, and unless Congress acts immediately it is likely to      become much worse.       Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their access to      health care because Congress did not renew funding for the      community health center program at the end of the fiscal      year, 30. Unless we renew funding immediately, 70      percent of funding will be cut, the doors of 2,800 community      health centers will close, and 9 million patients will lose      access to quality health care. That is unacceptable.       Our nation's community health centers provide affordable,      high-quality health care to more than 27 million people. This      includes not only primary health care, but also dentistry,      counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs. For the 13      million rural patients served, community health centers often      are the only health care provider for hundreds of[[Page S6933]]     miles. And they provide good jobs in communities that need      them the most.       Community health centers not only save lives, they also      save money. Instead of people ending up in expensive      emergency room care, or in the hospital, they get the primary      care they need, when they need it, at high quality medical      centers. Compared to other providers, community health      centers save on average $2,371 per Medicaid patient and up to      $1,210 per Medicare patient. What's more, community health      centers have played a pivotal role in generating more than      $49 billion in savings to the entire health care system.       Not only do we have to renew funding for the community      health center program, we must also improve and expand the      National Health Service Corps--the program that provides debt      forgiveness for young doctors, nurses, dentists, mental      health providers, and pharmacists who are prepared to work in      our nation's most underserved areas. Without debt      forgiveness, it is very hard to get new doctors to choose      primary care--an area of medicine that does not pay the big      bucks. It is also difficult to attract medical professionals      into the underserved areas of our country where they are      needed the most.       It is widely acknowledged that we currently have the most      wasteful, inefficient, and expensive health care system in      the world. Despite spending almost $10,000 per capita on      health care, twice as much as any other country, 28 million      Americans have no insurance, even more are underinsured, with      high copayments and deductibles, and we pay the highest      prices in the world for prescription drugs. The rarely      discussed truth is that thousands of Americans die each year      because they cannot afford to get to a doctor when they      should.       We must not allow a bad situation to get worse.       We cannot tell millions of low-income and working people in      every state in this country that they will no longer be able      to access the health care, dental care, mental health      counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs they desperately      need.       We cannot tell pregnant women that they will not be able to      get the necessary prenatal care they require in order to have      healthy babies.       We cannot tell the young person addicted to opioids or      heroin that there is no treatment available.       We cannot tell chronically ill senior citizens that they      will have to survive without the prescription drugs they have      used for years.       We cannot force community health centers, which provide      some of the most cost-effective health care in the country,      to lay off the doctors, nurses, dentists, and administrators      who keep these centers going.       Historically, the community health center program has      enjoyed widespread bipartisan support, and that support      continues. Today, along with almost all Democrats, there are      a number of Republicans who fully understand how important      these centers are to the well-being of their states and want      to see the program refunded.       The time for delay is over. Congress must act immediately      to fully fund the community health center program and the      associated workforce programs that provide them with the      well-trained staffing they need.

1029,topic-id,1608,"Mr.President, the United States today faces a major healthcare crisis. I think we all understand that. In the midst of that healthcare crisis, we face an even greater crisis in primary healthcare, and that means that there are many, many millions of people, not just people who don't have any insurance, not just people who are underinsured, but people even with decent insurance, who cannot get to a doctor's office when they need to because there is not a sufficient number of primary care physicians in their area. This is a major crisis today, but unless Congress acts immediately, that crisis is going to become much, much worse.  Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their access to healthcare because Congress has still not renewed funding for the Community Health Center Program, which expired on September 30. So we hear a whole lot of discussion about a whole lot of serious healthcare problems. This is one that we do not hear very much about, and that is that Congress has still not renewed funding for the Community Health Center Program, which expired on September 30. Unless we renew that funding immediately, some 70 percent of funding will be lost. Seventy percent of funding for community health centers will be lost. The doors of 2,800 service sites will close and 9 million patients will lose access to the healthcare they currently have. Nine million people will find that when they go to a community health center, that center will no longer be able to treat them. Clearly, this is unacceptable.  Our Nation's community health centers provide affordable, high-quality healthcare to more than 27 million Americans in every State in this country. This includes, by the way, in terms of community health centers, not only primary healthcare but also dental care, which is a major crisis in this country. It is very hard in many parts of America to find affordable dental care. It also includes mental health counseling, which is another major issue, especially within the context of the opioid and heroin epidemic we face. In addition to all of that, community health centers provide low-cost prescription drugs at a time when many Americans cannot afford the medicine they need.  They play a vital role in community after community, State after State, in providing healthcare to some 27 million For the 13 million rural patients served, community health centers often are the only healthcare provider for hundreds of miles in rural There are deserts in which Americans cannot access a doctor, and community health centers are the oasis in that desert. In addition to all of that, community health centers often provide a lot of good jobs in underserved communities that need them the most.  Community health centers not only save lives, but they also save money. Every dollar we invest in strong primary healthcare saves us dollars in the long run. Instead of people ending up in expensive emergency room care--and emergency room care is the most expensive primary care in the country--or ending up in the hospital because they can't and do not go to the doctor when they should, community health centers provide the primary care people need at a fraction of the cost of an emergency room.  Medicaid, in many cases, will spend one-tenth as much per patient for a community health center visit compared to an emergency room visit. So it is an opportunity not only to provide good quality care but to save substantial sums of money. Compared to other providers, community health centers save, on average, $2,371 per Medicaid patient and up to $1,210 for Medicare patients.  What is more, community health centers have played a pivotal role in generating more than $49 billion in savings to the entire healthcare system. They provide quality primary healthcare. They save money by keeping people out of emergency rooms or keeping them out of the hospitals. Not only do we have to renew funding of the Community Health Center Program, we must also improve and expand the National Health Service Corps, which is a program that provides debt forgiveness for young doctors, nurses, dentists, mental health providers, and pharmacists who are prepared to work in our Nation's most underserved areas. Without debt forgiveness, without telling young graduates of medical school who often leave school $200,000, $300,000, and $400,000 in debt--without giving them the opportunity to get those very large debts forgiven, it will be very hard to attract physicians and nurses and psychologists to rural areas or urban areas, where we have a significant ``underserving'' in terms of medical care.  So we need to fund not only community health centers but the National Health Service We currently have 1,100 National Health Service Corps members who are in school or in residency programs who will not be able to complete their training and become primary care professionals. We need to provide the workforce for community health centers and other underserved areas in this country.  Here is the very good news: The truth is, for many years, our community health centers, which are playing a vital role all over this country--urban areas and rural areas--have received bipartisan support. I know a lot of the bipartisan efforts of the past have kind of disappeared in the current political climate, but I am very happy to say there is a very strong piece of legislation introduced by Senator Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri, which has a number of Republican cosponsors on it.  My own view is, I think every Member of the Democratic caucus would sponsor it, but I think there is a whole lot of Republican support for this community health center bill. So not only is Mr.Blunt the sponsor of the bill, we have Senator Capito, Senator Gardner, Senator Collins, Senator Wicker, Senator Fischer, Senator Boozman,[[Page S6934]]Senator Murkowski, and Senator Cochran--who are all Republicans--onboard this legislation.  I believe, if that bill came to the floor today as a stand-alone bill, it would pass overwhelmingly because people in rural America, people in urban America--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--understand the very important role community health centers are playing. What this bill is about, significantly, is funding for 5 years not quite at the level I would like to see but at about 4 percent a year which, in terms of medical inflation, really means level funding. Now, that is in contrast to a bill that is being discussed in the House, which is simply not satisfactory. The House bill is talking about 2 years of funding, which means it is level-funded, which means it is a significant decline in real dollars for community health centers. Also, there are pay-fors for the bill which are totally unsatisfactory. It is a question of taking money from Peter to pay Paul and taking money from very important healthcare programs to put money into this important program.  It is widely acknowledged that we currently have the most wasteful, inefficient, and expensive healthcare system in the world, despite spending almost $10,000 per capita on healthcare, which is twice as much as any other country. I just returned from Canada the other day. They spend about 50 percent per capita of what we spend of guaranteed healthcare to all of their people, and many of their healthcare outcomes are, in fact, better than they are in the United So we spend a whole lot of money, and we are not getting particularly good value.  One of the areas where we are getting good value is in the area of community health centers. We need to not allow a bad situation to get worse. We have a very serious crisis in this country with primary healthcare, dental care, and certainly, mental health counseling. We are in deep trouble. If we do not immediately fund the Community Health Center Program, the National Health Service Corps, and the other workforce programs, a very bad situation will become tragically worse. We cannot tell millions of low-income and working people in every State in this country that they will no longer be able to access the healthcare, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs they desperately need. We cannot tell pregnant women they will not be able to get the necessary prenatal care they require in order to deliver healthy babies. We cannot tell the tragic number of people who are struggling today with opioid or heroin addiction that there is simply no treatment available to them because community health centers do a lot of that treatment. We cannot tell chronically ill senior citizens they will have to survive without the prescription drugs they have used for years. We cannot force community health centers--which provide some of the most cost-effective healthcare in this country--to lay off doctors, nurses, dentists, and administrators who keep these centers going.  Historically, the Community Health Center Program has enjoyed widespread bipartisan support, and I am glad to say that for this program, that support continues. What I am asking today is for strong support for the Blunt legislation. Let's get it onto the floor of the Senate as quickly as we can. Let's pass it. Let's demand that the House work with us to pass strong legislation. The time for delay is over. Congress must act immediately to fully fund the Community Health Center Program, the National Health Service Corps, and the Teaching Health Centers Program today.  We know these programs work. We know they save money and lives. These programs must be funded for 5 years, which is what the Blunt bill does. We should not continue to ignore this very serious problem for another day.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-31-pt1-PgS6932.txt,1010,COLLEGES NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT,2017,31,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am still reading my way through the 492-page proposal, but it doesn't take long to notice a huge flaw in the process: the majority is using the partisan budget reconciliation process, a process traditionally reserved for deficit reduction, to add over $1.5 trillion to the deficit and jam a reckless bill through the House without hearings, study, or debate. We don't have to operate that way.  Let's compare where we were the last time Congress reformed the Tax Code in 1986 to where we are today.  When Congress last took up this monumental task, it took over 2 years. There were 4 months of public hearings, more than 450 witnesses, 26 days of markup, and months of debate.

This bill, contrary to what some have said, rewards communities that have proactive, collaborative programs; stewardship programs; rural advisory committees; and wildfire protection plans to manage their forests without redundant NEPA processes.  A few thousand acres out of the millions acres of Federal forest land are now going to be enabled to be managed for wildlife successional forest habitat; removal of dangerous roadside and infrastructure threatening vegetation; insect and disease infestations; reducing hazardous fuel in the forests; and,[[Page H8331]]frankly, doing a little reforesting of salvage projects, which should have been allowed years ago.  We also pilot a few arbitration projects to stop the endless frivolous litigation of every single forest project, at least in Oregon, and I think elsewhere.  SRS payments continue to rural communities whose way of life has been, basically, taken away from them by the endless frivolous litigation in our Federal forests. Counties, for the first time, get some revenue from the very stewardship contracts that we want to encourage, but not at the expense of rural communities' economic health.  Many are still stuck in the recession, and this bill is critical to their revival. Oregon counties in the Oregon and California railroad areas also get the opportunity to be made whole again, like the original statute said.  I think it is important to note for a lot of our friends out there that the current regional forest plans still apply and are not undermined. We just give flexibility to the Forest Service folks within the regions to do what they think needs to be done to keep those forests healthy. We empower good management.  For those of you who are interested in innovation, this bill actually calls out cross-laminated timber and other thoughtful uses of forests and timber that can bring environmental and timber groups together like it should be in the 21st century.  Finally, most important of all for some folks, we actually get wildfire disaster funding included as a reasonable topic of conversation and get out of the current fire-borrowing policy that is preventing the Forest Service and BLM from doing good forest management to prevent those fires in the first place.  On balance, frankly, this is a very good bill and it is much-needed at this time.

Mr.Chair, I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives DeFazio and Panetta, for offering this amendment with me today. I think it is one of the important changes we can make that will help improve the Resilient Federal Forests  Collaborative forest management activities and categorical exclusions are an important tool in forest management and are designed to help the Forest Service and BLM speed the ability of those agencies to get into areas more quickly to improve forest health.  I believe the use of categorical exclusion should be reserved for reducing hazardous fuel loads, addressing disease and insect infestation, protecting water resources or increasing water yield, and maintaining or enhancing critical habitat. That makes sense. All these activities are very appropriate as designated activities for categorical exclusions.  Listing timber production as a designated activity, I believe, does not work in this context. Timber is a byproduct of all those activities. Therefore, it is unnecessary to actually include it as a specific designated activity.  Our amendment simply strikes timber production from the list of designated activities for categorical exclusion under section 111. It is a pretty clear-cut issue, in my book.  Mr.Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

274,topic-id,1267,"Mr.President, later this morning, after months of hemming, hawing, and delaying, House Republicans will finally release some legislative details about their tax plan. It may not even include all the details. The on again, off again nature of these deliberations should concern every Member of both That is not how you construct sound policy, especially with something as complicated and impactful as the Tax Each decision has enormous ramifications. Last-minute changes and sloppy drafting could change the fate of entire industries. Rushing it through in a hasty manner could have disastrous consequences.  We know why my colleagues are doing this. They don't want the public to know what is in this bill--increases on the middle class, breaks for the wealthy, big corporations getting a huge tax break, with no guarantee and very little likelihood that they will use the money to create jobs. That is why they don't want it to be public. It is not popular. On polls, it says: Do you support tax reform? They say yes. Do you support cutting the taxes on big corporations? They say, overwhelming, no. Do you support increasing taxes on the middle class? Overwhelming, they say no. Do you support decreasing taxes on the wealthy? They say, overwhelming, no. Those are the three tenets of this bill.  I hope my Republican colleagues here in the Senate are watching what is going on in the House--the problems they are having, the secrecy they need--and realize how difficult and dangerous it is to rewrite the Tax Code by the seat of your pants. Looking at the Tax Code and real tax receipts after all the loopholes, the wealthy in our country pay far less in Federal taxes than they did historically while the middle class pays more. Corporate profits are at a record high, while average wages have been stagnant. Those statistics articulate a real problem with the basic fairness of our Tax Code that tax reform could underline and could fix. This plan doesn't.  Instead, what we are seeing today is a plan that exacerbates the unfairness and inequality in our Tax If the details of the Republican tax plan are anything like we have seen in the press--to repeal the estate tax, to create a huge new loophole for wealthy individuals in the form of a reduction in the pass-through rate, and lowering the big rates on corporations and the wealthy--this sure doesn't fit the bill of helping the middle class.  Meanwhile, to pay for all the tax giveaways in their bill, the Republicans are likely to make it worse for the middle class--not just not help them but hurt them. It will slash State and local deductibility, which is a bedrock middle-class and upper middle class deduction, that would hurt so many middle-class taxpayers. Nearly one-third of all taxpayers claim it from all over the country, the vast majority of whom make under $200,000 a year.  Today, Republicans will crow about reaching a compromise on State and local, whereby they don't eliminate the deduction; they just reduce its value by about 70 percent. That means the bulk of the deduction will go away for so many middle class I would remind my Republican colleagues over in the House, particularly those from States like New York, New Jersey, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Virginia, and Colorado, that this compromise will not solve your problem. You will still pay the price with the voters.  I have been in politics a long time. I know how this will affect people--this compromise. They will not look and say: Oh, it could have been worse. Maybe we would have lost the entire deduction. They will say: This year, I have the whole deduction, and next year, I have less than half of it. They will take it out on our Republican colleagues who vote for it, particularly from those States, and they are throughout the country--in well-to-do and upper middle class and middle-class suburban districts.  So anyone who thinks this compromise is going to help them doesn't understand how politics works. It is not what it could have been. It is what it is and what it will be. Now it is a complete deduction. What it will be is that you will lose 70 percent of that deduction. No one is going to breathe a sigh of relief and say: I could have lost 100 percent.  Taxpayers will see that the Republicans have capped the amount of mortgage interest they can deduct from purchasing a new home now. That is the latest. Again, that hits right at the middle class. The mortgage deduction doesn't really affect the wealthiest. They have all their money in unearned income and capital gains, and all of that is what affects them the most. But the mortgage deduction is one of the hearts of the middle class. To play with it--to reduce it, to cap it, so they can do tax giveaways for the very rich--is not going to fly, I don't think--not in America, not in the America most of us know.  Taxpayers in the big cities and small ones, in the exurbs and suburbs, who[[Page S6978]]commute to work, will also notice if they never receive the critical transit benefits they receive now. Thousands of dollars a year that help pay when you transit to work will be gone. Why? To help the wealthy.  While some working Americans and middle-class taxpayers watch their taxes go up, they will read about how Republicans repealed the estate tax, which benefits only 5,500 families whose estates are worth over $5 million. They will learn how, instead of keeping the estate tax or closing the egregious carried-interest loopholes, the Republicans reached into their pockets--the middle-class pockets--to pay for a big corporate tax break that has no guarantee and very little likelihood of producing jobs. They will learn that, while the reduction to the corporate tax rate is permanent, the increase in the child tax credit is temporary.  Big, wealthy corporations count far more than kids in this bill. Corporations get permanent benefits, and families with kids get temporary and meager ones.  The Tax Code is a reflection of fairness in our society. Do we want to be in a country where everyone pays their fair share, including big corporations and the very wealthy? I think so. I think most Americans agree with that. Yet right now, our Tax Code is slanted in favor of the rich and the powerful, and the Republican plan makes it only worse.  The Republican tax plan would put two thumbs down on a scale already tipped toward the wealthy and powerful. It wouldn't create jobs. It wouldn't raise wages. The Tax Policy Center, as we know, estimated that 80 percent of the benefits of the Republican plan go to the top 1 percent--this new bill doesn't change that a bit--while nearly one-third of middle-class Americans would see a tax increase; 80 percent of the benefits to the top of our country, 20 percent of the benefits to the other 99 percent. That is not a middle-class tax bill, as President Trump said it would be.  Surely, we can do better. If our colleagues--whether it be in the House or Senate, our Republican colleagues who are trying to go it alone--can't pass this bill, we would welcome them. We would welcome an opportunity to sit down together and come up with a bill that really helps the middle class.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

366,topic-id,1159,"Finally, Mr.President, on taxes, the Republicans have promised to release the details of their tax plan this week. After months of talking about a plan with very few specifics, we will finally get to see how the Republican leadership plans to rewrite the Tax From all indications so far, the details of the Republican tax plan will be cheered by those in the country clubs and corporate boardrooms. Working Americans, on the other hand, might not have very much to cheer about.  The top 1 percent, law firms, hedge fund managers, can celebrate a lower top rate and an enormous new tax loophole in the form of lower rates on passthroughs. People who will most take advantage of these passthroughs are not small businesses. They can't afford all the lawyers and stuff. It will be the biggest, the most powerful, the richest, the wealthiest 5,200 families in America--those with estates over $5 million--who can celebrate the absurd repeal of the estate tax. Corporate America can celebrate hundreds of billions in tax cuts, which large corporations usually spend, not on new jobs--it is not what the history shows--but on CEO bonuses, stock buybacks, dividends. So while the wealthy and well-off will be busy celebrating the new tax breaks they might get if the Republican plan passes, working America will be looking over their shoulder at some real tax hikes.  Republicans are debating how to eliminate or reduce State and local deductibility--a bedrock, middle-class deduction claimed by nearly one-third of all taxpayers, the vast majority of whom make less than $200,000 a year. The Republican framework says they are going to eliminate the deduction, which totals tens of thousands of dollars a year for many working families. That is why removing State and local raises $1.3 trillion in revenue, and the GOP plans to spend that tax increase they are getting from the middle class on tax cuts for big corporations and the superrich. To be clear, it is a $1.3 trillion hike on middle-class families.  Now, there is a compromise on State and local deductibility that has been floated in the press. It is hardly much better. The Republicans are talking about continuing to allow State and local deductibility for property taxes but not income and sales taxes. That compromise raises $900 billion, meaning that Republicans, even with the compromise, are instituting nearly a trillion-dollar tax hike on working families to pay for breaks at the very top.  No matter how they construct this compromise, Republicans are still socking it to the middle class and the upper middle class but this time picking winners and losers. Sales taxes hit consumers the hardest. Ending the State and local deductibility for sales tax would fall on the backs of working-class and middle-class Americans, particularly in States like Tennessee, Florida, and Nevada, which don't have an income tax but have a large sales tax. States like Chairman Brady's, Texas, on the other hand, which have very high property taxes, would be much better off.  Worse still, the tax hike from this so-called SALT compromise would heap pressure on State and local governments across the country to make the agonizing decision about whether to raise taxes or cut spending for services--education, law enforcement, hospitals, highway building--on which their middle-class constituents rely.  A warning to my Republican colleagues from high sales tax States like Tennessee, Florida, and Nevada and high-income States--a lot of Republican Congressmen in those States of New York, New Jersey, California, Minnesota, Virginia, Colorado--that this State and local compromise will not solve your problem. The compromise does not solve your problem. It will still hit your constituents right in their wallets.  Now, another debate on the other side of the aisle is how to cap Americans' pretax contributions to their 401(k) plans. Can you believe it? Here in America, where we want to help the middle class save, where we want to encourage savings, we are making it harder? In layman's terms, here is what our Republican colleagues want to do. They want to tax your 401(k)s. I can't believe my Republican friends are even considering such a bad idea. We have had bipartisan support on expanding the ability to retire, particularly now that so many companies are no longer giving pensions.  Giving Americans the ability to put away pretax dollars for their retirement is one of the few provisions in our Tax Code that encourage early savings. Capping the amount Americans can contribute pretax or, in other words, turning every 401(k) into something more like a Roth IRA, will discourage Americans from saving and handicap their ability to retire with dignity and security now that defined benefit plans are declining.  For years, we Democrats--often joined by Republican colleagues--have fought for policies that would make 401(k)s more attractive, provide greater benefits--in other words, the exact opposite of what the Republican leadership is considering. We have put forward proposals on autoenrollment, increasing incentives for businesses that enroll workers and match contributions and letting small businesses pool together to offer plans. Each of these ideas would encourage more Americans, particularly younger families who have great burdens on them, to start saving early for retirement, which everyone agrees is essential to building up enough of a nest egg to live out your golden years in some degree of dignity and comfort.  The Republican proposals say to every future retiree that they don't care about your ability to retire. They just want to get your tax revenue into Federal coffers as soon as possible so they can give a tax break to the very wealthy--that top 1 percent.  The contrast could not be clearer. Democrats want to expand and enhance 401(k) plans, not cut them and cap them. That is a better deal for American workers and for middle-class families.  So instead of this one-party, secretive approach, Democrats and Republicans should be meeting with each other, talking about tax reform in a bipartisan setting to forge a bipartisan proposal. That is what committees were designed to do. That is what regular order was designed to produce. Just like on healthcare, our Republican friends are straining the legislative traditions of this body and risking their ability to govern effectively--we saw what happened with healthcare--by going at it alone.  The American people expect more of their elected officials than that of an assembly line of partisan legislation, crafted in secret, considered with such haste. I know why our Republican colleagues want to rush this through. They know the more the American people learn about this bill, the more it favors the wealthy over the middle class, the less they will like it. Just like with healthcare, once this bill is unveiled--now only 30 percent of the American people support it and even fewer will. Maybe our Republican colleagues will see the light and work with us to get good tax reform that focuses on the middle class, not on the top 1 percent.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-30-pt1-PgS6863.txt,1036,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2936, RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT",2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

509,topic-id,1304,"Mr.President, thank you.[[Page S6954]]                            Freedom to Negotiate  Labor unions and strong labor laws have helped build the middle class in America and protect the rights of workers for generations.  In the 1970s, union participation was around 30 percent, and it was a golden era for the American middle class. Wages went up. Families had benefits and vacations. Parents could pay for college. They could put food on the table and have money left over. The vast, thriving middle class was built on the blood and sweat of labor unions and those who organized the labor unions, often at their physical peril, back in the thirties.  Unfortunately, over the last few decades, union membership has declined and, along with it, middle-class wages and opportunities. In the seventies, union membership was near 30 percent, but it had fallen to just 11 percent of all workers by 2014. That decline is mostly because the union movement and, concurrently, the middle class, with which it is allied, have been under attack from big corporate special interests and the conservative movement for the better part of the last three decades. It is well funded by a small group of very rich and, I might say, greedy people, and it is patient.  Their goal is to, by any means necessary--Congress, the courts, whatever--break up existing unions and prevent new unions from forming. They will pursue any avenue in order to disrupt the ability of workers to organize and collectively bargain for a fair share of the profits they create so that they can make an extra buck.  These forces will do whatever it takes to keep rigging the system in their favor, like asking the Supreme Court to rule on Janus v. AFSCME, a case backed by the Koch brothers--$40 billion each, maybe more; plenty of money--but they hate giving any money to workers. And there is no record evidence of a single lower court ruling in its favor.  If anyone doubts the politicization of the Supreme Court, just look at their being willing to hear this case twice, which comes with a crazy legal theory that a First Amendment basis should be used to destroy collective bargaining. It is merely designed to eliminate the freedom of people to come together in unions. If the Supreme Court endorses the arguments of Janus, it will be a dark day for the American worker.  Chief Justice Roberts, who said he would be fair and call balls and strikes, in my view, has lost all pretence of fairness. He wants to keep the Court nonpolitical, but he keeps pushing cases like this. Since his confirmation, under Chief Justice Roberts, the Court has methodically moved in a pro-corporate direction in its constantly and consistently siding with the big corporate interests over the interests of workers. Already, it has been the most pro-corporate Court since World War A decision in favor of Janus will be a shameful capstone on that already disgraceful record.  I would say to all of those wealthy people who have plenty of money and to all of those corporate executives who get paid in the tens of millions, who are desperate to take money away from middle-class people whose incomes are declining, that you are creating an anger and a sourness in America that is hurting our country in so many different ways.  American workers deserve a better deal, and Democrats are going to offer it. We are calling it freedom to negotiate. We are offering the middle class, and those who are struggling to get there, a better deal by taking on companies that undermine unions and underpay their workers, and beginning to unwind a rigged system that threatens every worker's freedom to negotiate with their employer.  Our plan would, among other things, strengthen penalties on predatory corporations that violate workers' rights; ban State right-to-work laws that undermine worker freedoms to join together and negotiate; strengthen a worker's right to strike for essential workplace improvements; and provide millions of public employees--State, local, and Federal--with the freedom to join a union and collectively bargain with their employers.  Over the past century, labor unions have fought to stitch into the fabric of our economy a basic sense of fairness for workers. Each worker left on his or her own has no power against the big corporate interests that employ them, but together unions and workers who unite in unions can have some say.  No one taught me better about the lack of fairness than a 32BJ worker I met several years ago at the JFK International Airport, who was named Shareeka When I first met Shareeka, she was a mother of two children who was struggling to make ends meet. She was working the graveyard shift cleaning the terminals at JFK and serving hamburgers at McDonald's during the day. She was forced to rely on public assistance since she had gotten so little in wages from those jobs. She lived in a house with six other family members to be able to pay the rent. She was not a freeloader. She was working two jobs, but she got minimum wage and could hardly support herself. She barely saw her children and spent most of her free time in getting to this job--this poorly paid, minimum wage job. She had to take a bus for 2 hours from East New York to the JFK International  She was not angry, by the way, as she was a churchgoing lady. She had faith in God to provide, but she suffered so.  By the way, 30 years ago, if you had cleaned bathrooms at an airport, you would have been employed by the airlines or by the terminal. But because these companies have learned to farm out the labor to subsidiaries, to franchises, and to other corporations that have no accountability, now cleaning those toilets is a minimum wage job.  Over the last 4 years, though, I have seen Shareeka and her coworkers start to rebuild their dreams. She said to me: Senator, if I only could get minimum wage, I might be able to take my kids out to a restaurant--I never could--or buy them toys for I never could do that.  Shareeka joined the union, and they fought for a $15 minimum wage. In some parts of the country, that may seem like a lot of money. In New York City, I can tell you that it does not go that far. Costs are higher. Shareeka was able to quit her second job and spend time with her daughters, like all parents want to do. Shareeka and her coworkers won a union contract, and now they are able to gain the tools they needed to protect themselves and do their work in a safer environment.  Shareeka is a metaphor for ``American workers,'' so many of whom have lost good-paying jobs that have gone overseas or that have been closed due to automation. When they organize in these new types of jobs, they can get the kinds of wages people used to get in the jobs that have gone away.  It is pretty simple: When workers have the freedom to negotiate with their employers, they have safer working conditions, better wages, and fairer overtime and leave policies. Shareeka's story is a testament to that fact.  Our better deal, the freedom to negotiate, will do for so many Americans what Shareeka's union did for her in New It will turn things around for our country. Maybe middle-class wages will start going up, and maybe people will start having faith in the future again. We Democrats--hopefully, maybe, joined by a few courageous Republicans--are going to fight to get it done.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

584,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, I rise this morning with a heavy heart. My city, my dear city of New York, no stranger to terrorism, was once again its victim yesterday.  Yesterday afternoon, a man deliberately drove a rented truck into groups of pedestrians and cyclists, killing eight and injuring about a dozen more. Some of the injured were schoolchildren. These people were biking or walking home, enjoying a brisk and beautiful New York autumn day. It is tragic. It leaves a hole in your stomach.  Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, and we wish all of the injured a full and speedy recovery. We are also grateful--deeply grateful--to the New York Police Department and the first responders, especially Officer Ryan Nash, 28 years old, who was the first on the scene. He reacted quickly and decisively to bring down the attacker and bring him into custody. Who knows how much worse the tragedy would have been without his actions.  As one of thousands of New Yorkers who regularly ride on the path where this attack took place--in the last month, I have ridden on it twice--it hits close to home. My daughter went to the school near the scene, Stuyvesant High School, and she used the bike path I don't know how many times. This is our territory, our home.  The attacks are meant to confuse and terrorize, but, as the world learned after 9/11 and will learn again, New York doesn't scare easily. New Yorkers are resilient. We always bounce back. We won't let these terrorists get their way or affect our way of life. We will never let terror prevail.

The contrast between President Bush's actions after 9/11 and President Trump's actions this morning could not be starker.  Again, President Trump, where is your leadership?  I would say in closing that I have always believed that immigration is good for I believe it today.  President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be bringing us together and focusing on the real solution--antiterrorism funding, which he proposed to cut in his most recent budget. So I am calling on President Trump to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding immediately. Our city relies on this funding to track potential terrorists and to snuff out attacks. The NYPD, which bravely and quickly responded to the scene yesterday and brought the mayhem to an end, depends on this antiterrorism funding to keep our city safe day in and day out. So, again, I am calling on the President to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding immediately.

873,topic-id,297,"On judges, Mr.President, this week the majority leader has scheduled votes on four circuit court nominations. It is the first time, in my memory, that the Senate is being asked to process four circuit court judges in a single week. The circuit courts have an immense influence on our country, adjudicating some of the thorniest of legal issues. Only the rarest and most vexing circuit court decisions are appealed to and taken up by the Supreme For this reason, we typically don't sandwich circuit court nominees back to back to back to back only a week--only a week--after they have emerged from committee because Members who are not on the Judiciary Committee usually need time--always need time to review these candidates for such important, powerful, and far-reaching positions.  Why has the majority leader departed from this practice? Well, one can argue it is because the Republican agenda has been such a failure in this Congress, the leader has chosen to try and accomplish through the courts what Republicans have been unable to achieve through the legislative process. The Republican agenda has been so unpopular with the American people that it has stalled at every juncture so now they have made a brazen move to pack the courts with activist judges and remake them in their conservative, ideological image.[[Page S6863]]  Why has the majority leader done it?

Just as shocking was the admission by a Trump campaign adviser that he met with a Kremlin contact to discuss so-called ``dirt'' on Secretary While we know that Mr.Papadopolous had extensive email exchanges with other Trump officials regarding his outreach to Russian officials, his admission released today raises many more questions than it answers. Mr.Mueller and his team should be allowed to seek answers to those questions without interference from the President or anyone else.  The stakes could not be higher. We are talking about the pride and wellspring of our grand democracy--free and fair elections--which have been going on for more than two centuries and were disturbed and adulterated by a hostile, foreign power, with no good intent for the people of this country. It is critical that we need to get to the bottom of this. That is Special Counsel Mueller's job, and he must be allowed to perform it without interference.  The rule of law is paramount in We pride ourselves on it. The investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded. The President must not, under any circumstances, in any way, interfere with the special counsel's work. If he does, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues and the truth--the whole truth comes out.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-30-pt1-PgS6862-2.txt,1036,PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2017,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1003,topic-id,1692,"Mr.President, yesterday morning we learned that two members of the Trump campaign--Mr.Manafort, his one-time campaign chairman, and Mr.Gates, a close associate of Manafort's--were indicted on a dozen charges as part of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, including[[Page S6890]]money laundering, conspiracy to commit fraud, and conspiracy against the United  The fact that the activity in question took place partially before the Trump campaign offered Mr.Manafort the role of chairman in no way diminishes the gravity of the situation. If anything, it suggests that the Trump campaign was negligent in hiring as its chairman a man who was an unregistered foreign agent working for a pro-Russian proxy party in That man is now alleged to have been laundering large sums of money and concealing his identity as a foreign agent from the FBI and the Department of Justice, including during his time during the Trump campaign. Imagine having such poor vetting and poor judgment to hire such a person as your campaign manager.  We also learned that a Trump campaign adviser met with a Kremlin contact to discuss ``dirt'' they possessed on Secretary Clinton and had several email exchanges with other Trump officials about his outreach to the This disclosure should put an end to the idea that there was no communication or possible connection between the Trump campaign and  It is not fake news, Mr.It is not fake news. There was a connection between the Trump campaign and Who was involved, how much, and what happened are yet to be determined, but there was a connection, even though the President has denied that connection for months.  The President can assert whatever he wants on Twitter, but the facts are the facts. There were official members of the Trump campaign who were receptive to working with a hostile foreign power to obtain damaging information about their political opponent. These revelations should concern every Member of this body--Democrat, Republican, Independent, liberal, moderate, and conservative.  I understand the strength of the centrifugal forces in our politics that warp everything into a partisan battle between two sides. There are two sides to every argument, but no one is above the law, no matter what side of the argument one is on. The rule of law and American democracy are indisputable as our bedrock. We cannot abandon it for political expediency.  Special Counsel Mueller, who served both Republican and Democratic administrations--a lifetime public servant and a man of unimpeachable integrity--was appointed by President Trump's Deputy Attorney Mr.Mueller was a career prosecutor and is as straight of a shooter as they come. He must be allowed to finish the work he started without any interference. If he had nothing to fear, as he claims, President Trump would encourage Special Counsel Mueller to follow every lead and pledge his full cooperation. Instead, President Trump is again trying to divert our attention by making spurious allegations and trying to knock down anyone or anything in his way, playing right into the partisan, two-sides instinct of But this goes beyond partisanship. It goes right to the rule of law.  The President has a tendency to call anyone who disagrees with him and anyone who has facts that he doesn't like a liar, dishonest, and this, that, or the other thing. This has demeaned and degraded our Presidency and even our country. There are places where it must stop, and it should stop at the rule of law. I say that to President Trump, who may never listen, but I say that to my Republican colleagues here in this  The Founders of the Republic put at the center of our civic life no religion, dogma, or sovereign, but rather the rule of law. It is what separated the American experiment from the hereditary monarchies of the era and outdated ideas like the divine rights of  The rule of law holds in check our people, including our Donald Trump is President, not He cannot decree things to go away or say that facts are not facts. He is as subject as anyone else to the rule of law. That is what makes our democracy so grand. No one--no one--is below the rule of law's protection, and no one is above its reproach, including the President of the United It safeguards our democracy from the usurpations of demagogues and would-be dictators. It is why this noble experiment--the American experiment--continues, and Donald Trump is shaking the foundation of that when he tries to get out from Special Counsel Mueller's due process.  What Special Counsel Mueller represents is the rule of law at work in 21st century American democracy. Intentionally and spuriously impugning his integrity or smearing his efforts as partisan is not only inaccurate, it is not only false, it is not only fake, but it is damaging to a core ideal in our country, the independent and impartial rule of law that no man--even the President of the United States, even Donald Trump, think what he may--is above the rule of law.  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation must be allowed to proceed unimpeded, and my friends on the other side of the aisle must help dispel the notion that his investigation is in any way partisan. To their great credit, many of my colleagues have done just that in the last 24 hours, and I salute them.  The American people must have faith that when the very foundations of our democracy are shaken by a hostile foreign power, our independent judicial system built on the rule of law will not be degraded by partisan politics. We must loudly reject forces and actors that will try to make it so--on both ends of Pennsylvania Our leaders--our Republican leaders in the House and Senate--have an obligation to tell Donald Trump to lay off Mueller's investigation. Let it proceed where it goes. That is what our democracy is all about, and that is what leadership is all about.                          Republican Tax Plan  Mr.President, according to their timeline, House Republicans are set to release the details of their tax plan tomorrow. We will see if they can do it and, if so, just how detailed it will be. What everyone in America should focus on is the question of who exactly the Republican plan will benefit. Will it be the poor, the working class, or the middle class, or will it be big corporations and the richest 1 percent?  We live in a time of immense inequality, so much so that it strains the bonds of affection that bind us together in this country. The wealthy have amassed astonishing wealth--and God bless them. We don't begrudge them for their success, but working Americans and middle-class Americans have slipped further and further behind. The President is surely aware of this. He rode into the White House by channeling the legitimate anger and anxiety of working-class Americans who have seen their wages diminished and their jobs shipped overseas.  Will President Trump and his Republican Party, once in power, turn around and rewrite the Tax Code to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the middle class? Will he do a 180-degree turn from what he campaigned on and what he talks about and pass a plan for the hard right--those wealthy thousand people who give so much money to the Republican Party and think tanks? Will he bow to them against everything he campaigned on and what he says? It sure seems so.  On Wednesday, Republicans will likely propose to eliminate or substantially reduce the State and local tax deductibility, a bedrock middle-class deduction claimed by over one-third of all taxpayers--not just the wealthy--most of whom are in the middle class or the upper middle class. The proposal caused such angst in the House that it almost brought down the budget resolution. So Republicans have crafted a compromise that would allow taxpayers to claim State and local deductions on property taxes but not sales and income tax. That compromise would still cost taxpayers $900 billion.  Taxpayers in high sales tax States, like Tennessee, Florida, and Nevada, would get whacked, as would taxpayers in high income tax States, like New York, New Jersey, California, Minnesota, and Go figure that high property tax States, like Texas, Chairman Brady's State, would be better off under the proposal.  Picking winners and losers like this doesn't solve the problem. The new State and local compromise is still a nearly $1 trillion tax hike on the middle class to pay for tax giveaways to big corporations and the very wealthy.  I say to my Republican colleagues in the House, particularly to those from suburban and fairly affluent districts, middle-class and upper middle class[[Page S6891]]districts, that they vote for this compromise at the same peril as they voted for the bill that would totally eliminate State and local deductibility. The damage still remains, and don't think a small compromise--a small haircut--can let you escape from the political whirlwind you would reap if you vote for this bill.  The Republicans are also likely to unveil tomorrow what they plan to do with 401(k)s. We have heard reports that Republicans want to tax 401(k)s to get more revenue to pay for their tax giveaways to the rich. It is another clear example that this plan is not going to be for the middle class. The 401(k)s are one of the best tools we have to encourage Americans to start saving early for retirement. We know Americans aren't doing enough of that right now, at the same time that defined benefit plans are enjoyed by fewer Americans than in the past, as companies reduce or eliminate pensions. Why make it even harder for Americans to prepare for their retirement on their own by saving through 401(k)s? Why tax them so that you can give tax cuts to the very rich?  We Democrats have a better deal to offer the American people on 401(k)s. Rather than having Uncle Sam dip his hands into American retirement plans, we Democrats believe Americans deserve a helping hand when it comes to their retirement. In just a short time, we will release our 401(k) plan.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Strange).

550,topic-id,468,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Huizenga for yielding me time.  A little bit of history: this piece of legislation, the underlying idea, actually was fostered a few years ago. One of my closest friends in Arizona, Lakshmi, is freaky smart, electrical engineer, off the charts He and I were having a conversation about a company that he was really interested in that had been started by a handful of his old friends.  Well, it turns out his old friends had gone through all this process, and he had just sort of been watching what they were doing.  Now, Lakshmi is an absolute expert on the technology that these gentlemen are putting together, but because of a series of timing and other things, he was walled off from investing in a company that was using a technology he was an absolute expert in, because he didn't meet the accredited investor standards. He didn't have the million dollars in the bank.  His argument to me was, should his knowledge on a company and its product, their risk profile, its opportunity to succeed and its potential failure in the marketplace be based on his bank account, or should it be based on his knowledge?  Now, the legislation has gone through a couple generations of compromise. I personally preferred the original bill, a bit more expansive, but this is a good thing, because for our brothers and sisters on both sides of the aisle here, I think we are embracing this concept that we all care about the curve where we are seeing the wealthy getting wealthier in the United States and much of our hardworking middle holding sort of flat.  This is one of the reasons: we have created these definitions where accredited investors, I think only, like, 600-some-thousand people, have gone through the process to hold that designation in our society, meaning it is a tiny sliver of our society that is allowed to invest in these types of businesses.  We have a bureaucracy that for how many years now the regulator has said: Your ability to invest in these types of organizations is based on your bank account.  Today, we take the sort of first step on a bipartisan basis to say: Yes, bank account is one, but how about your risk tolerance, your knowledge, your expertise, and your understanding that many of these fail, and many of these businesses become amazing successes, but are you able to process both the technology, the risk, and the information?  For many of us, we are hoping that the opportunity to be part of the investor class starts to become much more egalitarian across our society instead of just being the hallmark of the ultrawealthy in our country.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Huizenga for giving me a moment and for moving this bill forward.

401,topic-id,764,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, the Independent Payment Advisory Board was created, in fact, by the Affordable Care Act, as we have heard. It will be a 15-member panel composed of Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed experts charged with developing proposals to prevent Medicare costs from getting too high. It is about fiscal prudence.  The majority and its allies, however, spread many mistruths about the board. It has even been called a death panel, if you remember that. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. Its recommendations may not increase cost-sharing premiums or taxes, or reduce benefits. They have no way to do that.  Not a single soul has been nominated to the board. It is not yet instituted as an entity. Today, in the absence of an appointed board, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to submit recommendations to Congress if a trigger is met.  The independent Medicare actuaries predict that this board will not be triggered until at least 2021, 4 years from now.  Mr.Speaker, I think we have to ask: Why are we spending time today, with everything facing us, addressing a problem that could exist 4 years from now? Is the majority so desperate to undermine the Affordable Care Act that they are repealing a panel whose sole purpose is keeping Medicare costs in line?  According to Gallup, 55 percent of the public approves of the healthcare law. They want to see it strengthened, not eviscerated.  In contrast, under the majority's leadership, Congress has an approval rating of just 13 percent.  Should 13 percent be telling 55 percent what they need to do?  Instead, since the majority has so far been unable to repeal it, they are going to undermine it brick by brick. The President is even sabotaging the Affordable Care Act administratively, slashing the budget to publicize the law by 90 percent, and cutting the open enrollment period in half.  In the interest of public service, let me say that the enrollment period started yesterday and continues to December 15. Please go and take care of your health insurance.  What the White House has done is make a direct attempt to cause chaos to weaken signups under the open enrollment period that began this week.  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare growth has been historically low. The growth in healthcare prices is at its lowest level in 50 years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that Medicare growth rates will remain beneath this panel's targets until 2021, hence the reason for not doing a panel for 4 more years.  It is really too bad that this Congress and the majority insist on sabotaging[[Page H8397]]the Affordable Care Act, chipping away at its benefits. We should be strengthening it. Remember that every President since Theodore Roosevelt just about has tried to do a healthcare bill like the one that we have today. Perhaps just because Barack Obama did it that there is so much problem with it in the majority.  There is a bipartisan Senate bill crafted by Senator Alexander and Senator Patty Murray that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found last week would save money, stabilize the insurance marketplace, and reduce the debt by $3.8 billion. That is all without anyone losing their insurance.  Why won't we take up that bill?  We never get an answer for that question.  What is it about trying to take healthcare away from poor people or that we won't put a bill on the floor that has all the advantages and savings that we know and that is totally bipartisan? Is it because the majority knows it will pass?  Our Nation has urgent problems. Our infrastructure is crumbling, education costs skyrocket so high so fast that it is unattainable to many students. We desperately need to stabilize our health insurance markets by passing the compromise by Senators Alexander and That is what we should be doing here today.  There are Members on both sides of the aisle who want to see improvements to the board, but that is not what the bill does. It terminates it altogether. It is the wrong approach at definitely the wrong time.  Regardless of what you think about this board, we should be able to agree that this Congress has more important things to do than address a problem that might not exist for 4 years, if at all.

448,topic-id,626,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, 33 days ago, funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which 9 million children rely on for their healthcare and well-being, expired after the program was allowed to lapse. States crafted budgets, assuming Federal CHIP funding would arrive on time as it has always done, and they are now scrambling to develop a patchwork solution to keep the program alive.  Six States and the District of Columbia have warned they will run out of funding by December, next month. Thirteen States say they will soon have to tell enrollees they could lose coverage without immediate congressional action. Utah officials have even considered sending letters to enrollees as early as this week letting them know the program is being forced to wind down.  The Kaiser Family Foundation has found that 32 States are expected to run out of funding by March if Congress fails to act. I am glad we are here today with a bill to reauthorize CHIP and other public health programs, but they are woefully inadequate.  This bill is paid for by eviscerating funding from one of the most important parts, again, of the Affordable[[Page H8404]]Care Act that helps to keep people well: the Prevention This fund focuses on children's health, expanding access to lifesaving vaccines and reducing the risk of lead poisoning, among many other things.  This is a particularly heartless cut when you consider that many residents of Flint, Michigan, still can't get a clean glass of water from the faucet or bathe in uncontaminated water 3 years after the water crisis began. Children there in Flint will be forced to live for the rest of their lives with impacts ranging from neurodevelopmental damage and behavioral changes to hypertension and anemia, damage caused by a government that failed to act.  If it fails to adequately fund Medicaid for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands as they continue to try to rebuild following the devastating recent hurricanes, that would be a compounding of the tragedy. This bill fails to waive the requirement that both of those islands match Federal investment before they can access any of the Medicaid funding, and we don't deal with that at all, even for  Seventy percent of Puerto Rico doesn't even have power 6 weeks after Hurricane Maria hit. I am proud to say that a lot of New York utility workers are down there now, and I am sure we will see results soon. Residents of Puerto Rico are washing clothes and bathing in contaminated streams and rivers, and drinking it as well. A million people there still don't have any running water. They don't have the ability to put up millions of dollars, either, to match these funds because they are struggling to survive. We don't address that. These are American citizens, and we have an obligation to help them.  These reauthorizations are a chance to really work together and deliver, but we are worried about this opportunity because there is no indication that this bill could pass the Senate with the cuts that it has made to the Affordable Care I am referring, of course, to the ones that relate to preventive care. That would be a major tragedy.  As I have already said, so many States are right at the edge of not being able to fund the program at all. Other States are ready to tell both community health services and CHIP that they are no longer providing for them.  This partisan approach will only delay the extension of the programs even further. I consider that a major dereliction of our duties.

471,topic-id,311,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, in May, the Republican majority recklessly passed their healthcare repeal bill without any analysis at all from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, finding out a month later that it would have taken insurance away from 23 million people.  I fear the majority is going to make the same dangerous mistake with their tax bill. The New York Times reported that some sections of the bill released today are placeholders that will ``allow Republican leaders to work out the details of a new set of revenue-raisers that would be inserted in the bill before the full House votes on it''--in other words, they will be a surprise.  After the Ways and Means Committee marks up the bill, they will rewrite the bill in a back room and jam it through the It is beyond irresponsible to vote on a bill of this magnitude without knowing how it will impact hardworking  We employ dozens of well-qualified, nonpartisan expert economists and public policy analysts with advanced degrees in the Congressional Budget Office precisely for moments like this, and it appears the majority is again, this year, prepared to move so fast that no Member will have the benefit of their nonpartisan advice.  So if we can defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will prevent this massive tax cut bill from coming to the House floor unless nonpartisan analysis from the experts at the Congressional Budget Office has been available for at least 2 days.  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York?[[Page H8409]]  There was no objection.

472,topic-id,246,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, we don't have time to spare playing games here with the CHIP program. It is on life support in many States, with officials scrambling to try to keep it alive. This is a program, you have heard before, that 9 million children rely on.  And 2,800 community health centers are at risk of closing their doors if we do not reauthorize the community health centers. That would leave millions of people without healthcare, cost more than 50,000 jobs, and already the centers nationwide have been forced to consider cutting services following the majority's failure to reauthorize the program before it expired on September 30.  Everybody knows that these centers do remarkable work. They deliver quality care at lower cost. More than 330,000 veterans relied on them for healthcare last year alone. They could be reauthorized under a clean bill in seconds. Instead, the majority is putting them at risk through this partisan bill, which seems unlikely to pass the Senate, and we will then be nowhere.  If you want to know why only 13 percent of the public approves of Congress under the leadership, just look at the bill before us today. Republican leaders have turned even the most bipartisan programs into endeavors that seem unlikely to become law.  They have disallowed the Democratic Party to have any substitute with any other ideas that they did not have before so that we can, as ",CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8402.txt,1069,"RECOGNIZING TELSTAR ASSOCIATES, INC.",2017,2,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

356,topic-id,470,"I thank my friend from Michigan (Mr.Mitchell) for hosting this Special Order on the College Transparency  Mr.Speaker, I have spoken on the floor a number of times about the House's work to improve education in the country. I have been proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Education and the Workforce Committee to improve career and technical education, and I have also spoken about my own experience with higher education as a nontraditional student taking classes at night while I ran a construction company during the day.  Tonight, I am happy to be here to talk about ensuring that students, parents, guidance counselors, and legislators like us have access to information that can help students make informed decisions about what college to attend so that policymakers have access to research and data that will better inform our work on higher education policy.  Today, colleges and universities report data to the U.Department of Education that has been collected by a voluntary survey available only to a limited group of graduates. The survey is not offered to any student who is attending college part-time, who is not seeking a degree, who has transferred from another college, or who doesn't have Federal loans.  In today's economy, we are trying to make higher education more available and accessible to nontraditional students, yet we omit a large group of nontraditional students from this data. That is just one of the reasons why we need to pass the College Transparency  This bipartisan legislation seeks to modernize higher education reporting so that students and families can make responsible choices about what college or university to attend. It will help empower students and families to determine how much they need to take out in student loans and which programs at different schools provide the best paths toward their dream job or a career.  Too many students today are graduating with massive amounts of debt. Too many students graduate with majors offering too few opportunities. At the very least, students need to have this data available to them to make informed decisions.  This bill, as has been pointed out by Mr.Mitchell, is endorsed by more than 80 education and business organizations, including Advance CTE and the Association for Career and Technical Education, organizations that represent great schools like Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in my district.  This bill has bipartisan support in our committee, in the Senate, and the House, and it is essential for transforming our higher education system to meet the needs of a 21st century economy. So, again, I am happy to rise to speak in support of this act.  I would like to thank my friend from Michigan for hosting this Special Order this evening, and I urge my colleagues to consider supporting this important piece of legislation.

859,topic-id,341,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Arizona (Mr.Biggs) for hosting tonight's Special I also thank Mr.Fitzpatrick, as well, for his leadership in this bill. I am really glad to be part of this effort.  We could stand here tonight and talk about the FDA's process for approving drugs. We could talk about the countless patients across the country who struggle to get accepted into a clinical trial for a drug that could save their life. We could even stand up here tonight and share with you one of the uplifting stories of a patient who received a lifesaving drug because of a State's right-to-try law. But we have heard this, and we know all of this.  We know the FDA's approval process takes years. We know there are too few spots in clinical trials for patients in dire need of help. We know that right-to-try laws give families hope and can save lives. What I would like to talk about tonight is the moral imperative we face on this right-to-try legislation.  America is home to the world's greatest doctors and medical experts. It is home to the world's greatest medical schools and hospitals. We have cured diseases that were once a death sentence. We have directed our national resources to fight epidemics that have saved lives here at home and overseas. We don't give up.  What we do here in this Chamber, Mr.Speaker, speaks volumes. What we do here shows the Nation and the world where our priorities are.  Is our priority the bureaucracy of this city that too often misses opportunities simply because of its inability to act, or is our priority the patients and families whom we represent to consult with a doctor and decide for themselves how they choose to fight against illnesses for which we continue to search for a cure?  For me, the choice is clear, Mr.I choose my constituents. I choose life, and I urge every single Member of this body to do the same. We cannot afford the cost of inaction.

353,topic-id,568,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.2434, the College Transparency I want to thank my good friend from Michigan, Congressman Mitchell, for his leadership and bipartisan work on this very important bill.  This time of year, parents and students are beginning to make important decisions about higher education for the next school year.                              {time}  1930  Unfortunately, there is little information available about what can be expected from the large investment in a college or a university. This legislation will enable students and families to make informed choices about their education after high school.  The College Transparency Act will provide actionable, customizable information for students and families as they consider college and universities by accurately reporting on student outcomes, such as enrollment, completion, and postcollege success across colleges and majors.  Most importantly, this information will tell students how other prospective students have succeeded at an institution and help point them toward schools best suited for their unique needs and desired outcomes.  The current college reporting system is overly burdensome on institutions, yet it provides little practical information for students and families due to significant gaps in college data reporting.  Additionally, the data collected only reports graduation rates for students who begin as full-time students and finish at the same institution, leaving out successes of part-time students and[[Page H8372]]any student who transfers and completes a degree at an institution other than where they started. With more than half of bachelor's degree recipients attending more than one school and nearly two-thirds of community college students starting part-time, we have to ensure that these students count.  One example of this impact from my alma mater, The Ohio State University, is a veteran named Tami returned to school to complete her social work degree after her military service. She completed an associate of arts degree at Columbus State, a community college, and transferred and eventually graduated with a social work degree from The Ohio State She had a 3.9 grade point average in the classroom and excelled in her two-semester field placement at the university's Office of Military and Veterans  Under this system, Tami's success story would not count toward Ohio State success. Under the new system, it will. Today, the system would not count Tami because she started at one school and transferred to another school. Under the legislation that Mr.Mitchell is working on and that I am talking about today, Tami would count again.  We need to make people count again. Tami served our country. Tami got out of the military, came back, went to school part-time, then transferred schools, went to school full-time, and completed her practical experience. Under the current reporting system, Tami doesn't count.  Let's fix that. That is what this bill would do. Under the updated system, institutions would securely report privacy-protected student level data to the National Center for Education Statistics, or NCES would be responsible for presenting summary information on a user-friendly website for students and families, while securely storing student information.  This legislation will help countless students and families make better decisions about where to go for higher education, where they should attend.  I want to thank Congressman Mitchell and Congressman Polis for introducing this important, bipartisan legislation that will help so many students and families, students like  I hope we can roll up our sleeves, work together, and get this bill passed. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

1013,topic-id,2083,"Mr.President, one of the privileges of being in the Senate is actually being able to preside, as the Presiding Officer is doing right now--to sit at the Chair and listen and watch my colleagues talk about issues that matter to them, and a lot of times issues that matter to their In this amazing country of ours we have so many great States, great stories, and great traditions. When I am presiding, some relate to Texas, where the current Presiding Officer is from, celebrating our unique traditions, while still appreciating that at our best we share values as Americans together--opportunity, liberty, justice, and fairness. It really is one of the things that makes the Senate a great body and what makes us strong as a nation.  One of the things I like to do is to come to the Senate floor and talk about some of the traditions in my State--some of the things that I think make Alaska the greatest State in the I know some of my colleagues will not fully agree with that, but we all get to brag about our When I do that, I like to talk about an individual whom we recognize as the Alaskan of the Often, it is somebody who is doing something in a remote part of Alaska whom not a lot of people know about. It is very important to share that with my colleagues in the Senate and other colleagues watching on  Today, I would like to recognize a young Alaskan from Gambell, AK, named Chris Apassingok, a young whaler who is helping to keep the tradition that we have in Alaska--Native whaling--alive and well. He is our Alaskan of the  This year, Chris was a keynote speaker at the Elders and Youth Conference, which is a precursor to the[[Page S6898]]Alaska Federation of Natives conference held each year in one of our cities. It is the largest annual gathering in the United States of any Native peoples, and there is nothing like it in all the country. AFN, as we call it in Alaska, is certainly a highlight of my year. My wife and I and our kids always try to get there.  Let me spend a few minutes talking about why Chris's speech about whaling was so important and what happened after he landed a huge bowhead whale in Alaska and why that was so inspiring for so many in my great State and, really, around the country.  Gamble, AK, is where Chris comes from, a Yupik village of about 700 people on Lawrence Island, on the northwest edge of It is 1 of 11 Alaska communities that participate in two whaling seasons, recognized and authorized by the International Whaling These are subsistence communities. What does that mean? They are subsistence communities because whale meat is actually a necessity in feeding these communities.  I should point out that we have no road systems at all in Northern Most of Alaska has no roads connected from community to community, and certainly not in The Presiding Officer and I have had the opportunity to travel around He has seen our great He knows that many communities are only accessible by air or seasonal barge. Some areas can only be reached at certain times of the year because of the weather. These communities need food. They need whales.  The annual bowhead whale migration provides the largest subsistence resource available in these remote areas of our great Even so, when a whale is taken, the sharing does not stop with the residents of the community. Each whale produces between 6 and 25 tons of food, on average. This meat is shared with other subsistence communities in our State and with family members and elders throughout the That is a hugely important part of Alaskan Native culture. This is another example of the resourcefulness of the Alaskan Native peoples, which has enabled them to survive in the Arctic--with some of the toughest weather and conditions anywhere in the world for millennia--and which has shaped the culture of Alaska and the character of our State today.  Back to Chris, he is an extraordinary hunter, even by the standards of Gambell, a community of extraordinary hunters. He could aim and shoot a rifle at the age of 5. By 11, he had trained himself to strike whales, as one writer put it, ``standing steady in the front of the skiff with the gun, riding Bering Sea swells like a snowboarder.''  This past April, Chris and his father set out on a boat in the Bering Sea to do what their ancestors have been doing for thousands of years.  After they got a bearded seal, they spotted a spouting bowhead. Chris took the first shot, it was accurate, and it was a huge whale, 57 feet 11 inches. It took 2 hours to tow it to shore and 4 days for the community to carve it up. As always, when a whale is landed, it is time for celebration in the community, and this time was no different, but shortly after this, things unfortunately went sour for Chris and the community.  A radical special interest activist, with a large online following, read the story about Chris and the whale and he began to attack Chris and so did many of his followers, from all across the globe--hundreds of people, most of them adults, cyber bullying and attacking a 16-year-old boy from Gambell, AK, who had, at that point, only left his village once in his life.  They were shameful, no respect, no civility, and I mean vicious attacks. I will not repeat them here. It is enough to say they were greatly upset. In the community, Chris, his family, and his mother cried all night. Chris was angry that he and his family were being attacked for partaking in this necessary tradition that his community and his ancestors have been doing for thousands of years--thousands of years.  However, this young man, despite the hateful messages from adults, from adults who live a world away, despite the names they were calling him, Chris, now 17, cut through the noise, stood strong, and gave a great speech at AFN, that he will continue to hunt and feed his family and his community the way his ancestors have done for millennia.  At his speech last week at AFN, he asked: ``Will you stand with me as I continue my hunting [traditions of my family]?'' The crowd applauded, all of whom rose when he asked this: ``Will you stand with me'' as we continue our subsistence activities that we have undertaken for thousands of years?  I hope everyone across the country stands with this extraordinary young man--truly brave and courageous--as he continues his tradition and his right to hunt and feed his community.  This afternoon, I will be holding a hearing in the Commerce Committee about whaling in Alaska and how necessary it is for subsistence and the survival of these important cultures. I hope all Americans also stand with so many other proud Alaska whalers, protecting their rights to hunt the way their ancestors have hunted.  Thank you, Chris--a young man in Alaska, 17 years old--for standing tall for your people, for all of I also want to thank his parents Susan and Daniel for raising such a fine hunter.  Congratulations, Chris, for being our Alaskan of the                            Economic Growth  Mr.President, I want to follow on with regard to what my colleague and good friend from South Dakota talked about in terms of tax reform. We are debating tax reform now. We are marking up a bill. The Finance Committee has not marked up the bill yet. It is working on the bill, but as Senator Thune just mentioned, we have to have one common goal in this body, which tax reform should be driving, and that is the issue of economic growth--the issue of economic growth.  We would think this should not be a partisan issue, but one of the things I am struck by, in my little under 3 years in the Senate, is how little we have talked about economic growth.  I have tried to come down to the Senate floor and speak about this issue a lot. In my view, with the exception of national defense, this is the most important issue Congress can be focused on right here, this issue of growth. How is the U.economy doing? Is it strong? Is it weak? Are we healthy or are we sick? By any measure over the last 10 years, we are sick.  I bring this chart to the floor a lot to talk about what has gone on in the last several decades in terms of economic growth. This has the growth rates of every administration dating back to President If you look at the numbers, this red line is the important line. This is 3 percent GDP growth. It is not great. It is not bad. Since the founding of the Republic, the average since World War II is closer to 4 percent, but 3 percent is It is certainly what we should be focused on in terms of hitting.  If we look at this chart, in certain years, Eisenhower, Kennedy--by the way very bipartisan--we have had very strong growth. When people talk about what makes America great, this is what makes America great: strong economic growth. This is what has driven our country for decades.  We see some of the numbers, Kennedy, Johnson, 5, 6, 7 percent; Reagan, Clinton, 5, 6, 7 percent. Then we look at the last decade--boom, a giant dropoff. We haven't hit 3 percent GDP growth in well over 10 years--well over 10 years. As a matter of fact, President Obama was the first President ever to not hit it.  What happened? Did anyone talk about it? Did the last administration talk about it? They never talked about it. As a matter of fact, what they did is they started telling Americans: Don't worry. We are going to dumb down expectations. We are going to tell you--despite this chart, despite what this really means--this represents the American dream. Despite the fact that all previous administrations were focused on 3 percent, we are not going to talk about that. We will dumb it down and call this anemic growth back here--1 percent, 1\1/2\--the new normal.  What does that mean? That means we are going to surrender. We are going to say, well, this is really America hitting on all cylinders. This is what you as Americans should expect in the future.  I think this idea of the new normal, which a lot of people in DC talk about, is probably one of the most dangerous concepts in Washington, DC, right now. The new normal means that despite[[Page S6899]]this history of 3 percent or higher for decades, we are going to surrender because our policies have smothered growth, have smothered the American dream.  Here is the good news. I think we finally have a White House that is starting to focus on this issue. Certainly, the Congress is starting to focus on this issue, and the Senate is starting to focus on this issue with policies like tax reform, with policies like regulatory streamlining, with policies like infrastructure, with policies like energy. As the Presiding Officer knows, our two great States are part of the energy renaissance that can drive economic growth well above 3 percent.  As we focus on tax reform, as this body focuses on tax reform, I am hopeful my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, can all agree that one of the key elements of what we are doing with regard to tax reform, and every other policy in this body, is to get us back to traditional levels of U.economic growth, to get us back to where people say: I have great opportunities. Look at this economy--not the doldrums and the anemic growth and the sub-3 percent new normal that we have been told by other Federal officials to accept as our fate.  That shouldn't be our fate. We should have policies, particularly tax reform, that are focused on getting back above that red line, and I am certainly hopeful that all my colleagues--all 100 U.Senators--can agree on that goal, strong economic growth for American families and reigniting the American dream with strong GDP growth that is much higher than what we have seen in the last 10 years.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-10-31-pt1-PgS6886-3.txt,2290,HEALTHCARE,2017,31,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,topic-id,861,"Mr.Speaker, I applaud my colleague, Mr.Lipinski, for pulling this effort together this evening.  Mr.Speaker, climate change is real, and I applaud my colleagues on the Climate Solutions Caucus for working together in a bipartisan effort to try and find common ground and to seek to work together to pass legislation to address this very real threat.  I believe the greatest opportunity we have here is to include efforts to move our Nation toward a greener economy as part of a comprehensive infrastructure bill.  We must address climate change for three reasons: first, the Earth is part of the divine creation, and we have an obligation to preserve and protect our precious gift; second, moving toward a green economy that retrofits homes and buildings and installs solar and wind farms will create good jobs at good wages that simply cannot be exported; and, third, the main topic I wish to address this evening, is moving toward a green economy, reducing our dependency on foreign oil, and addressing climate change is essential to our national security.                              {time}  2030  Americans rarely talk about it and sometimes forget, but we supported Osama bin Laden against the Russians in We supported Saddam Hussein in Iraq after we lost the Shah after the Iranian We supported the Assads in And we still maintain a close relationship with the Saudis, despite their support for Why? Because our national economic strategy and security has relied for decades on access to foreign oil.  Our meddling in local affairs to ensure the oil spigot flowed freely has sowed distrust across generations throughout the Middle  By moving towards a green economy and eliminating our dependence on foreign oil, we can clearly say to the Middle East: We never wanted your land, we never wanted your money, and now we don't need your oil. All we want is for people of the region to stop trying to kill each other. It will take some time, but moving towards an economy independent of foreign oil is the best way to get there.  In addition to eliminating our dependence on foreign oil, we must try to stall the rapid rise in extreme weather events, droughts, and desertification that is destabilizing huge swaths of the Middle East and The number of refugees in the world has grown from 35 million only 10 years ago to 65 million today. War and violence are exacerbated by the instability caused by climate change.  One of the most violent regions in the world today is The instability in Syria began with droughts that destroyed the livelihoods of the Syrian people that rely upon an economy which is 85 percent agrarian. When people lost their farms, they fled to the cities looking for work, but, of course, they could not find it. Then they looked to the Assad government, but, of course, were ignored. Fomented by the Arab Spring, they began to revolt. The result? The Syrian Government has killed almost a half million of its own people and millions more refugees. This story is being repeated throughout the region.  Although the people suffering are thousands of miles away from the United States, our national security is threatened by these failing states. The rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq is a prime example of the impact of failed states on Western security. Mass migrations by those seeking to alleviate suffering, millions seeking political and economic reforms place pressure on corrupt and incompetent governments that are unable to respond to the needs of a population seeking opportunity and hope.  Our enemies who wish to foment instability--Russia, Iran, North Korea, and violent terrorist factions--are aided by the effects of climate change and the instability it causes. We must do everything we can to stall the growth of this nefarious trend.[[Page H8379]]  The good news is that there is a growing bipartisan consensus in the Climate Solutions Caucus and the armed services community that we must act. The Armed Services Committee in the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act acknowledged that ``climate change is a direct threat to the national security of the United States,'' and that ``the Department of Defense must ensure that it is prepared to conduct operations both today and in the future, and that it is prepared to address the effects of changing climate on threat assessments, resources, and readiness.''  Secretary of Defense Mattis has said, ``Climate change can be a driver of instability, and the Department of Defense must pay attention to the potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.''  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford has said that climate change and rising sea levels pose serious long-term threats to the country. The number of natural disasters will increase in the coming years, along with ``the requirement for humanitarian assistance'' and the response required for the military for civilian disasters.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank again my colleagues for the work that they have done to try and bring the issue of climate change to the American people, and to try and find solutions to this very real problem that is not only affecting us here at home, but our national security throughout the world.

380,topic-id,531,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the hundreds of Montana women who honorably served our country during World War  They braved the German u-boats to serve on the frontlines. Women cared for the wounded and connected calls to the battlefield offices of GEN John Without them, the American forces serving in Europe could have faced catastrophe. Without them, the course of the war could have been much different.  We shouldn't be surprised. Montana women have been breaking down barriers for generations.  Merle Egan Anderson pressured the U.Government for 60 years to get the women who worked the Army's telephone switchboards the status of ``veteran.'' Montanans like Merle Egan Anderson and Lena Roy volunteered to be a part of the Army Signal Corps without promise of pay, benefits, or recognition of their service. The Signal Corps women, nicknamed the ``Hello Girls,'' proved their worth immediately. Merle, Lena, and their peers' speed and precision allowed officers to communicate across battlefields, enemy lines, and war-torn terrain. They served at the frontlines and quickly garnered the respect of the men with whom they served. They braved enemy fire and suffered casualties among their ranks. Despite their outstanding service, they returned to an indifferent government who denied them veteran status, including healthcare and burial rights.  Merle Egan Anderson took on the government, and 60 years later, she won. When the government granted the ``Hello Girls'' veteran status, only 18 of the 223 women were still alive.  Nearly 200 Montana nurses entered military service, 86 of whom braved enemy submarine-patrolled waters to care for troops on the frontline. They came from 56 cities, towns, and forgotten railroad stops across the Big Sky  Nurses Elizabeth Sandelius from Cokedale and Harriett O'Day from Billings were cited for heroism under fire for their service in Cora Craig from Glasgow, MT, received a Silver Medal from the King of Siam for her care of soldiers from present-day Eula Butzerin braved the carnage of post-war France to find the battlefield grave of her brother Roy, marked only with a stick and his dog tags.  Thirteen Montana women enlisted in the Navy and served stateside. Gertrude Zerr from Chinook achieved the rank of chief yeoman, directing fellow yeoman in the naval headquarters.  During the war, these women proved to their fellow Americans and the world that women were an asset in battle. Their service defied gender stereotypes and helped changed the tide of public opinion that culminated in the 19th Amendment of our Constitution, granting women the right to vote at long last. They helped pave the way for women to take on combat roles in World War II and beyond.  After the war, Montana's World War I women veterans faded into history. Their service remains largely unknown.

372,topic-id,336,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize Tom Troxel for the many years of his career that he has dedicated to improving the ecological health of our national forests and for his service to the timber industry, which has strengthened the economic health of local communities.  Tom has spent more than 40 years in the forestry industry, and he has mastered the art of promoting environmentally sound forest management practices while strongly supporting the timber industry. Tom has been a trusted source of reliable and accurate information throughout his career.  He received his bachelor of science in forestry from the University of Montana in 1973. He worked for the U.Forest Service in Idaho, Montana, and California, starting as a summer job in 1970 during college and continuing until 1989.  Since 1989, Tom has been the executive director for the Intermountain Forest Association based in Rapid City, During that time, he has worked with forest products companies in Colorado, South Dakota, and Wyoming and has played a critically important role in addressing issues related to national forest timber programs, including forest planning, project analyses, timber sale contracts, and legislative affairs.  Tom has served as the executive director of the Black Hills Forest Resource Association, the executive director of the Colorado Timber Industry Association, and a member of the Forest Service's Forest Planning Advisory He has also served as the executive secretary of the Black Hills Regional Multiple Use Coalition for 25 years and as a member of the board of directors for the Rapid City Chamber of  Those of us who have had the privilege of working with Tom over the years will miss the knowledge and expertise he has shared with us. Our forest landscapes and communities are better because of his work.  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Tom for his work on behalf of our forests, the timber industry, and local communities. As he retires from his very successful career, I wish him continued success and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-30-pt1-PgS6875.txt,1534,RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT OF 2017,2017,30,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1011,topic-id,1277,"Mr.President, the House and the Senate are moving forward on a final draft of our tax reform bill, and I am excited about the progress we are making. We have one goal in mind with tax reform. It is to provide real relief to ordinary Americans--to the parents who are questioning whether they can afford the car they need to fit their growing family, to the single mom who is wondering how she is going to pay the bills this month, and to the middle-age couple worrying about a secure retirement. Everything in our tax reform framework is centered on providing relief to these  To start with, we are going to provide them with a substantial amount of direct relief by lowering their tax rates and doubling the standard deduction so that they are keeping more of their paycheck every month.  We are also going to significantly expand the child tax credit.  And we are going to simplify and streamline the Tax Code so that it is easier for Americans to figure out what benefits they qualify for and so they don't have to spend a lot of time and money filing their taxes.  All of these reforms mean more money in Americans' pockets. But we are not stopping there. We are also going to focus on reforming the business side of the Tax Code so that we can give Americans access to the kind of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set them up for a secure future.  In order for individual Americans to thrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive. Thriving businesses create jobs. They provide opportunities. They increase wages and invest in their workers, and they invest in new equipment, facilities, and product lines to innovate and expand their businesses.  Right now, though, our Tax Code is not helping businesses thrive. Instead, it is strangling both large and small businesses with high tax rates.  Our Nation has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world--at least 10 percentage points higher than the majority of our international competitors. That is a problem for American workers because high tax rates leave businesses with less money to invest in their workers, to increase wages, or to create new jobs. This situation is compounded when you are an American business with international competitors that are paying a lot less in taxes than you are.  It is no surprise that U.businesses struggling to stay competitive in the global economy don't have a lot of resources to devote to creating new jobs and increasing wages. A study from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent down to 20 percent would increase average household income by $4,000 annually.  A second study shows a similar pay increase. Boston University professor and public finance expert Larry Kotlikoff found that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent would increase household income by $3,500 per year on average. That is a significant pay raise for hard-working  In addition to lowering the corporate tax rate, there is another important thing we can do to increase the availability of jobs here at home; that is, reforming our outdated, worldwide tax system. Under our worldwide tax system, American companies pay U.taxes on the profit they make here at home, as well as on part of the profit they make abroad, once they bring that money home to the United  The problem with this is that most other major world economies have shifted from a worldwide tax system to what is called a territorial tax system. In a territorial tax system, you pay taxes on the money you earn where you make it and only there. You aren't taxed again when you bring money back to your home country.  Most American companies' foreign competitors have been operating under a territorial tax system for years. So they are paying a lot less in taxes on the money they make abroad than American companies are, and that[[Page S6897]]leaves American companies at a disadvantage.  These foreign companies can underbid American companies for new business simply because they don't have to add as much in taxes into the price of their products or services. When foreign companies beat out American companies for new business, it is not just American companies that suffer. It is American workers. It is the American workers employed by these companies who live and work in literally every State in the Union, and it is the American workers who work for the small and medium-sized companies that form the supply chain here in the United  For every American company that operates in countries around the world, there are countless companies here at home that supply the raw material for the products that are sold abroad--businesses that handle the packaging and shipping of those product and enterprises that supply support services like accounting, legal, and payroll services.  America's global companies rely on a web of supporting businesses that spans the country, and when these global companies struggle, so do these supporting businesses and their workers.  By transitioning from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, we will not be just boosting wages, jobs, and opportunities for American workers employed by these global companies, but we will also be increasing wages, jobs, and opportunities for workers at the countless small and medium-sized businesses throughout our country that make up the supply chain for America's global companies.  Finally, our tax plan will tackle the other key part of improving the playing field for American workers; that is, lowering the tax rates on small businesses.  Small businesses are incredibly important for new job creation, but like big companies, right now small businesses are being strangled by high tax rates. That can make it difficult for small businesses to even survive, much less thrive and expand their operations. Lowering small business tax rates and making it easier for small businesses to recover their invested capital more quickly will free up the money that small business owners need to expand their businesses to add workers or to give employees a raise.  Together, these aspects of tax reform are essential to reversing the lackluster economy of the last 8 years. Americans deserve better, and tax reform can be the key to putting this country back on the path to solid, sustainable economic growth.  Mr.President, before I close today, I wish to switch gears for a minute and talk about judicial nominations. We have had the chance to confirm some excellent nominees so far this year, many of whom Democrats have ultimately supported. But despite this fact, Democrats have insisted on delaying the process of almost every single nomination to a district or circuit court. That is pretty much the definition of partisanship--when you obstruct nominees based not on any disagreement you have with them but simply because you don't like the person who is doing the nominating.  Democrats' delays are ultimately pretty pointless. We are not going to stop confirming nominees just because Democrats are dragging out the process, but these delays are a disservice to the American people. There are a lot of important issues that the Senate needs to be debating, from spending bills to tax reform, and the time that we waste on pointless partisan exercises is time taken from those important issues.  While Democrats' partisanship is frustrating, there is a much more serious issue that has come up during these judicial confirmations; that is, the anti-religious sentiment displayed by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle during the hearing on judicial nominee Amy Barrett's nomination, which we will be voting on this week.

The better way can be found in this piece of legislation, to be able to not only address what we must address, in terms of fighting forest fires when they break out, but also to be able to have a responsible, proactive management forest to be able to make sure that we are creating healthy forests.

980,topic-id,1485,"Madam President, I rise to speak about the nomination of Professor Stephanos Bibas, on whom we have just invoked cloture, but before I do that, I want to take a quick moment to observe that we had a big development today--a big development in that the House of Representatives, the majority Ways and Means Committee members, led by Kevin Brady and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have unveiled a tax reform plan that is a very exciting step forward in our ambition to bring tax relief and is a direct pay raise to hard-working Americans whom we represent, creating an environment where we could have much stronger economic growth and much more opportunity and rising wages for the American people.  So I congratulate Chairman Brady and all the members of the Ways and Means I know this process has a long way to go, but they are off to a great start with a very solid bill. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee as we finalize our version of the pro-middle-class, pro-growth tax reform, and I am excited to see that step forward.  Madam President, let me get back to the issue of the candidacy of Professor Stephanos Bibas and say how enthusiastically I support his candidacy to serve as a judge on the U.Court of Appeals for the Third  I thank the President for nominating Professor Bibas, I thank Chairman Grassley for moving Professor Bibas through the nomination process of his committee, and I thank Leader McConnell for bringing Professor Bibas's nomination to the floor. I also thank my colleagues who just voted to invoke cloture so that later today we can vote to confirm this terrifically well-qualified man to a really important court.  Let me touch on some of his qualities. Professor Bibas has a tremendous wealth of experience in the law as a legal scholar and a practicing attorney, so much so that the American Bar Association voted to give him a unanimous rating of ``well-qualified,'' and let me tell you why. 1, he starts with outstanding academic credentials. Professor Bibas graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University, and he did so at the age of 19. After Columbia, he studied at Oxford University in England and earned his law degree from Yale  He has clerked at the highest levels of our Federal court system. He clerked for U.Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and Judge Patrick Higginbotham on the U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth  The fact is, Professor Bibas is an accomplished legal scholar. For 16 years, he has served as law professor at two outstanding universities--the University of Iowa College of Law and the University of Pennsylvania School of Professor Bibas has been a prolific author whose academic writings are frequently cited by the U.Supreme Court, courts of appeals, and other law professors. He has written two books and more than 60 articles, many of which have focused on criminal law and procedures. In fact, in his writings, he has expressed views regarding criminal justice reform that I suspect many of my Democratic colleagues would share. For instance, Professor Bibas has criticized what he sees as the overuse of plea bargains in our courts as being unfair to criminal defendants who then never get their day in court.  So there is no question that Professor Bibas has very extensive academic credentials, but he is also an experienced attorney. He has served on both sides of our criminal justice system. He has been a prosecutor, and he[[Page S6983]]has been a defense attorney. He has a balanced perspective from both sides of this part of our judicial system. He served as a Federal prosecutor in New York City, where he prosecuted over 100 criminal cases.  Currently, he is the director of the Supreme Court Clinic at the University of Professor Bibas also argued six cases before the U.Supreme He won a landmark U.Supreme Court decision for a criminal defendant in the Padilla v. Kentucky case, a case that held criminal defense attorneys must advise their noncitizen clients about the deportation risk associated with a guilty plea. That was a Professor Bibas case. He has represented dozens of other clients before the Supreme Court, and most of those cases were pro bono clients--clients he did not charge any fees because they couldn't afford experienced counsel. He voluntarily provided that service for them.  Over the course of the work he has done, as a result of the work he has done for the Supreme Court, he has been praised by both Justices Kagan and Justice Ginsberg praised him as ``among the very best of lawyers presenting cases to the Supreme Court.''  I hope all of my colleagues will support Professor Bibas's nomination. He has outstanding credentials, he has a wealth of experience, and I hope everyone will see that in his background.  I must state I am disappointed that Senator Durbin, our colleague from Illinois, has stated that he opposes Professor Bibas's nomination. Senator Durbin has stated that his opposition is because of an unpublished academic paper that Professor Bibas drafted in 2009. In that paper, he proposed the consideration of the use of corporal punishment as an alternative to imprisonment for certain criminal offenses, but Professor Bibas has stated unequivocally that he decided not to publish the paper because he realized that idea was wrong, was deeply offensive, and he does not support corporal punishment for criminals.  Professor Bibas also testified at his confirmation hearing that he fully understands and respects the difference between the role of a professor who considers theoretical questions and writes about them, on the one hand, versus, on the other hand, a judge who is deciding cases that impact the lives of real people.  One of the most important reasons I am an enthusiastic supporter of Professor Bibas is his clear understanding of the role of a judge in the American constitutional system. From my review of his record and from my conversation with him, it is clear he understands the proper role of a judge is to apply the law, including the Constitution, as written and not to make policy himself and that his obligation is to treat everyone absolutely equally, regardless of race, sex, wealth, political affiliation, political connections, or anything else.  Unfortunately, many liberals and progressives have a very different view of a judge. Many of my colleagues and others believe the Constitution is a living document, by which they mean that it really means whatever a judge decides it means. Under this view, changes to the law and Constitution can be made by unelected, unaccountable judges who then substitute their policy preference for the preference of the American people as reflected in their elected representatives. Some who hold this view even think judges should take into account such factors as a person's race, sex, wealth, or political affiliation in deciding cases. In my view, that is a deeply flawed view of the law and is fundamentally inconsistent with the principles of the separation of powers that is essential to our democracy, the sovereignty of the American people, and the fair and equal application of the law to all people. Contrary to this view, Professor Bibas understands the proper role of a judge is to apply the law as written and to treat everyone who comes before him equally, not to impose his policy preferences or impose the law differently for different people.  Finally, let me say a word about Professor Bibas's temperament and suitability for the bench. I think it is very clear that not only does he understand the role a judge is supposed to play, but he is a man of character and of a temperament that makes him very fit to be a judge. I will give you an example. In one letter of support for his nomination, a bipartisan group of 121 law professors from across the ideological spectrum stated that ``his fair-mindedness, conscientiousness, and personal integrity are beyond question.''  In another quote, ``We have no doubt that his judicial temperament will reflect these qualities and that he will faithfully discharge his duty to apply the law fairly and evenhandedly in all matters before him.''  I am very pleased and proud to support Professor Bibas's nomination to the Third I am completely confident he has the intellect, experience, temperament, and respect for the limited role of a judge in our system, those attributes that are necessary for him to excel as a Federal appellate judge, and I am pleased to speak on behalf of this highly qualified nominee. I urge all of my colleagues to support his confirmation.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time on the Bibas nomination expire at 1:45 p.m. today.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sasse). Is there objection?

H.3279 would correct a problem in our Federal oil and gas leasing laws that makes it more difficult for companies to commercially produce helium from Federal lands. Helium is a critical element for high-tech research and modern medicine, and because of its unique properties, there are simply no substitutes.  On the Natural Resources Committee, we have spent many years overseeing the Federal Helium Program, culminating in the bipartisan Helium Stewardship Act signed into law 4 years ago.  While the Helium Stewardship Act improved the management and sale of Federal helium, it didn't do much to promote the development of new sources of helium, which are in high demand. By allowing companies to hold onto Federal oil and gas leases if they are producing commercial quantities of helium and only helium, then the problem that kept potentially valuable helium resources under lock and key is resolved.

H.2600 authorizes the conveyance to the State of Iowa the reversionary interest on the Western Historic Trails Center in Council Bluffs,  In 1989, Congress authorized the Department of the Interior to partner with the State of Iowa to create a trails interpretative center to support three National Historic Trails that cross through the region.  In 1988, the Secretary of the Interior transferred approximately 400 acres to the State of Iowa for use as a visitor center. Ownership was then transferred to the State with a reversionary clause that limits the use of the property to a visitor center.

One of those laws is Public Law 80-846, known commonly as the 1948 The 1948 Act targeted only one tribe, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa, also known as the Meskwaki Nation, and gave the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction over their tribal lands.  In 1948, the Nation did not have a formal mechanism for law enforcement and was not in a financial position to create one. This was used as the rationale for the stripping of these jurisdictional rights. But this has not been the case for many years. The Tribe has a full-time police department as well as a fully functioning court system.  The continued existence of the 1948 Act has resulted in an unfair system of crimes committed on Meskwaki land, whereby a Native-American defendant must face the possibility of two prosecutions, State and Tribal, but a non-Native defendant faces only State prosecution.  That is why I join my colleagues in supporting H.1074.

The one on the Oregon side was terribly dangerous, man-caused, human-caused. It blew out 14 miles in one night headed toward  These are monster fires. We lost 678,000 acres this year to forest fires in my great State of It is about two-thirds of the entire size of the State of Rhode It is enormous. This is happening year after year, and the consequences are extraordinary.  Smoke chokes our airsheds. Schools literally had to shut down and send kids home because it was too smoky to have them inside the school. The 30th anniversary of Cycle Oregon was canceled. That is a major annual bicycle ride that occurs; 30 years, the 30th anniversary, canceled. They couldn't find a way to pull it off. The Shakespeare Festival down in Ashland, nine performances had to be canceled; $400,000, Mr.Speaker, just in ticket receipts that had to be foregone. I am told they had to lay off people as a result.  When you think about not only the lost forests--this is what a forest looks like after it is burned--the ground is often sterilized. You can't even go back and replant for a year or two in some cases because there is no soil left.  The impacts are enormous on our environment. Those of us who are concerned about the environment, about carbon emissions into the atmosphere,[[Page H8314]]in 2015, when a like amount was burned in Oregon, the Forest Service estimated the blazes emitted more than 90,000 tons of fine particulates and 14.2 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That is equivalent to more than 3 million cars; 3 million cars.  The cause of these increasingly catastrophic fires, as John Bailey of the Oregon State University's College of Forestry pointed out during a hearing earlier this month in our Energy and Commerce Committee, in some cases, the forest landscapes in my part of Oregon, eastern Oregon that would have historically held about 20 trees per acre, have more than 1,000 trees growing there today.  You see, we have stopped management. In many cases, we have stopped fire. The forests continue to grow, and die, and build, and get more dense, and so when fire does strike, it is with devastating consequence.  My friend from Florida, and he is my friend, when he gets thunderstorms in Florida in the summer, he gets a lot of rain with it, I bet. If we have thunderstorms in Oregon, we don't get the rain.

We can reduce the size and intensity of fires by 70 percent if we do the kinds of projects that thin out the forest, better manage, and be better stewards of our public Federal forests that are contemplated as a result of this legislation.  In Oregon, this bill would take away an arbitrary prohibition on harvesting trees over 21 inches in diameter that has tied the hands of our forest managers. We would clarify timber production mandates of the unique Oregon-California lands in southern and western Oregon to live with the underlying statute and actually have it enforced.  When fires do happen, we would exchange this for a new, healthy forest that would grow green trees that sequester carbon and restore a landscape that we in the West so enjoy.  It is long past time to fix our broken forest policy. I commend the Rules Committee for bringing this bill forward, and I commend Mr.Westerman, Mr.Bishop, and others who have worked on this on both sides of the aisle to help us stop the fires that ravage, and kill, and destroy, and to help us have healthy, green forests.

687,topic-id,439,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Mr.Guthrie from He has done a terrific job on the Energy and Commerce Committee on many fronts related to improving healthcare, especially for seniors and low-income Americans, among others.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.849. This is the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017. This will repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board,  The purpose of IPAB is to reduce Medicare's per capita growth rate. While, certainly, that is important work, this is not the solution.  The IPAB, created by the Affordable Care Act, would be composed of 15 unelected bureaucrats authorized to unilaterally make decisions regarding Medicare's finances, whether that be through draconian cuts to provider payments or by imposing policy changes that would reduce Medicare spending if the program exceeds an arbitrary growth rate target.  In other words, they can do just about anything they want to cut Medicare, and we don't have much of a say in it. These changes would automatically go into effect, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be forced to implement these reductions should IPAB be triggered, unless Congress passed legislation that would achieve the same amount of savings.  It is also worth noting that current law does not require a public comment period before IPAB issues their recommendations, so there would be no chance for the public to weigh in. And individuals and providers would have no recourse against the board--can you imagine that?--as its decisions are not subject to appeal or judicial review. This is hardly a model of transparency and accountability.  While IPAB hasn't been constituted yet, the threat of this provision of law remains. So I cannot support I never have, because its potential cuts to providers, our doctors and hospitals and others and healthcare facilities would increase out-of-pocket costs for seniors and potentially limit the availability of medical services, restricting seniors' access to care, particularly in our rural areas.  Congress can and should act now to prevent IPAB and prevent the unelected bureaucrats from ever being at the helm of our country's Medicare  I know the importance of this program. It took very good care of my parents, my wife's parents, and others I know. We should reject the premise of surrendering our oversight and our responsibility to preserve and protect the Medicare Program to a board with the power to make binding decisions about Medicare policy, with little accountability.  We know how to make sure seniors have an affordable, sound, reliable healthcare system.

515,topic-id,961,"Mr.President, last year, powerful corporate interest groups actually stole a Supreme Court seat and handed it over to their handpicked choice, Neil Now those powerful corporate groups are about to use that seat to deal a devastating blow to hard-working teachers, firefighters, nurses, and police all across this country.  On September 28, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a case called Janus v. AFSCME Council 31. AFSCME 31 is a union representing public sector workers in This case will determine whether the public sector unions that represent teachers, nurses, firefighters, and police officers in States and cities across the country can collect fees from all the employees in the workplaces they represent.  Many expect that Justice Gorsuch will deliver the deciding vote in that case, that he will force unions to represent employees who do not pay dues and, in doing so, cut off sustainable funding for public union organizing.  Judges are supposed to be impartial, but there is no reason to expect that Justice Gorsuch will be impartial in this case. On the afternoon of September 28--the very same day that the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the Janus case--Justice Gorsuch attended a luncheon at the[[Page S6956]]Trump International And he didn't just attend an event at a hotel that makes money for the He gave the keynote speech for a rightwing group funded by one of the Koch brothers and by the Bradley Foundation--billionaires and wealthy donors who are pumping money into the people behind the Janus case.  It is no surprise that these rich guys want to break the backs of unions. After all, unions speak up, unions fight back, and unions call out billionaires who rig the system to favor themselves and to leave everyone else in the dirt.  What is at stake in the Janus case is basic freedom--the freedom to build something strong and valuable, the freedom to have a real voice to speak out, the freedom to build a future that doesn't hang by a thread at the whim of a billionaire. And just as the Supreme Court decides to take up a decision that puts the freedom of millions of working people in jeopardy, Justice Gorsuch shows up as the star attraction for a billionaire-sponsored outing to celebrate an organization that is sponsoring an operation to put workers' freedom on the chopping block.  With this kind of brazen disregard for fairness and impartiality, it is no wonder that Gallup Polls have found that fewer than half of all Americans approve of the way the Supreme Court is now handling its job. In a shameless decision to abandon even the appearance of neutrality, Justice Gorsuch makes it clear that he is on the attack against American unions and American workers.  In the Trump administration, workers have been under repeated attack. Since taking office, President Trump has signed several laws sent to him by the Republican Congress, laws that directly undermine the wages, benefits, health and safety of American workers. In just 10 months, they have rolled back rules designed to make sure that Federal contractors don't cheat their workers out of hard-earned wages. They have delayed safety standards that keep workers from being exposed to lethal, carcinogenic materials. They have given shady financial advisers more time to cheat hard-working Americans out of billions of dollars in retirement savings, and the list goes on.  This is a democracy, and in a democracy, the government in Washington is supposed to work for the people who sent us here. So why is it that the Federal Government seems to be working against the interests of 150 million Americans who work for a living? Well, there is one reason--money.  Money slithers through Washington like a snake. Its influence is everywhere. There are obvious ways that we know about--the campaign contributions from giant corporations and their armies of lawyers and lobbyists--but it is also the think tanks and the bought-and-paid-for experts who are funded by shadowy money, whose point of view seems always to help the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful.  Powerful interests invested vast sums of money in electing President Trump, and with each of his anti-worker actions, their investments are paying off. Powerful interests also spent vast sums of money to push Federal judges who will tilt our courts even further in favor of billionaires and big businesses.  They did it when they spent millions of dollars to hold open a Supreme Court seat for over a year. They did it when they spent millions more to promote Neil Gorsuch to fill that seat. Now that the Court is poised to deliver a massive blow to public sector unions and workers, their investment is paying off big time.  The stakes here couldn't be higher. Millions of teachers, nurses, firefighters, and police officers are looking to the Court for a fair hearing of the case. They are holding out hope that their freedom to come together and to stand up for themselves in the workplace, their freedom to fight for higher wages, their freedom to fight for more generous benefits, and their freedom to fight for a better future for themselves and their children will be preserved.  Unless we make real change, working people are just going to get kicked again and again, and we can make change. We can make the change right here in We can stand up and fight for our democracy, and we can start by demanding that everyone in our government is accountable, including the President of the United States and the Supreme Court of the United  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

1005,topic-id,841,"Mr.President, just last week, the Republican-controlled Congress rammed through a budget with the sole purpose of allowing Republicans to enact a tax plan that would take money from working Americans and put it into the pockets of giant corporations and wealthy individuals. The following week they killed an important rule that would have made it easier for Americans to hold big banks and corporations accountable when they lie, cheat, and steal from working families.  There have been countless stories of the Trump administration in disarray--juicy rumors of distrust and division between and among congressional Republicans and the White House, reports of Republicans' inability to advance key parts of their agenda, but that is only half the story. The other terrifying half is this. Since day one of this administration, President Trump and congressional Republicans have been working hard to make government work better and better for the rich and the powerful. While they have fumbled on their legislative agenda, they have been quietly working to help powerful interests capture our courts.  That shouldn't come as a surprise. For decades, those powerful interests have poured eye-popping amounts of cash into electing politicians who will promote their interests in They have hand-picked politicians who will enact laws that will make it easier for corporations to abuse their workers or cheat their customers or make an extra buck and make it harder for agencies to hold them accountable for wrongdoing. They have executed a well-funded campaign to rig the rules of the game so the powerful always come out on top and the people come out on the bottom, and they know the courts are the place where they can shape the law for decades to come.  Most Americans already know that while we have one set of laws on the books, we really have two different judicial systems. One justice system is for the rich and the powerful. In that system, government officials fret about being too tough on white-collar crime so wealthy individuals or giant corporations that break the law walk away with a small fine and a pinkie promise not to do it again, and when those executives break that promise, they get 2nd, 3rd, and 23rd chances. Every time they get caught, the cycle repeats. The corporation pays the fine, says some magic words, and everyone goes right back to breaking the law.  The second justice system is for everyone else. In that system, tough on crime is the name of the game. People are locked up long before they go to trial because they don't have the money for bail. Individuals who commit minor, nonviolent offenses are slapped with long prison sentences, and even after they serve those sentences and are released, they are branded with a scarlet letter that creates barriers to employment, to housing, and to opportunity. That second justice system even traps families, children, and elderly parents whose families are blown apart and whose communities are destroyed.  That second justice system has earned America the dubious title of holding the world's highest incarceration rate. Despite having less than 5 percent of the world's population, the United States holds more than 20 percent of the world's incarcerated population. Russia, China, and North Korea don't even come close--not only in raw numbers but in the percentage of their population behind bars. America's legal system is great at locking people up but terrible at doing what it is supposed to do, dispensing equal justice under law.  Those words--``Equal Justice Under Law''--are etched into the front of the Supreme If we truly believe those words, we need to start making some changes, and in recent years, we have seen some progress. Some State and local governments have made real efforts to reduce crime and lower incarceration rates. Massachusetts is one of the States leading the way with elected officials in both parties debating transformative changes to the judicial system aimed at replacing this tough-on-crime policy with smart-on-crime policies. The call for reform also extends to corporate crime. Public outrage at corporate greed has created[[Page S6893]]pressure to hold the rich and the powerful a little more accountable, but President Trump is committed to reversing that trend. He is working hand in hand with this Republican Congress to ensure that the rich get to play by their own set of rules while everyone else gets crushed under the awesome power of law enforcement.  This week will be a big step forward for the two-part justice system as this Senate prepares to hand lifetime appointments to four judges whose careers make it clear that they have no interest at all in fixing our broken justice system.  Let's take a look at their records.                       Nomination of Allison Eid  Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid, who was nominated to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, has used her power as a State Supreme Court Justice to shield corporations from accountability. She has voted to make it harder for individuals to bring class action lawsuits against huge corporations that break the law. Sound familiar?

692,topic-id,559,"Mr.Speaker, the issue here about Medicare is one where there is universal support in this body for that program that was passed in 1965 by a bipartisan vote. It is a lifeline for many of our seniors--for all of our seniors. It is a program where, since everybody pays, everybody benefits. It gives all of us confidence that our parents or ourselves will have access to good healthcare.  We have a challenge. The cost of healthcare in this country is far too expensive, and it is for a variety of reasons that our country spends twice as much on healthcare as most industrialized countries in the rest of the world and we don't get better results for that.  The challenge for us, if we want to save healthcare, particularly Medicare, is to start focusing on reforms that bring the cost of healthcare down and don't compromise quality.  The Affordable Care Act extended access to healthcare for millions of Americans, but it also included some steps that began bending the cost curve. The rate of growth in the Medicare spending has started to come down under the Affordable Care It was patient-centered programs, it was accountable care organizations, it was value-based payment systems. These things where, for the first time, Congress talked not just about extending access, but trying to reform payment systems so that we could get the benefit of a more efficient system.  The IPAB is simply one of the potential tools that would be used in order to present to Congress recommendations. Unlike what Mr.Walden said, it would be the final say of Congress whether we wanted to approve or not any recommendation by the  Here is the difference in how we are approaching healthcare. Many in this body on the Republican side have focused on the cost of healthcare, its contribution to the debt. The policy proposal in the form of repealing the Affordable Care Act, its way of reducing the cost of healthcare was to take healthcare away from 24 million That is what that bill did.  That is one way to control the cost of healthcare, have people go without. It is the wrong way. We all know that. We have got to bite the bullet here and start addressing the fact that we spend too much. Some of it is wasteful procedures, some of it is gaming the system, some of it is these incredible maneuvers by drug companies.  I am just going to give one example because I want to give this example as an indication of how right before our eyes bad things are happening that we are allowing to occur.

AbbVie and Amgen made a deal.

If there is an issue that I understand that comes before this Congress, it is our forests.  As I listen to accusations from across the aisle, I trust my colleagues are not intentionally trying to mislead, but they seem to know so much about just what isn't so. This is a bipartisan bill with Democratic cosponsors and it is based on sound scientific management.  Mr.Speaker, we are on the floor today to debate a rule and, as you know, this rule is part of the process of the House of Representatives that will conclude later this afternoon with votes not only on this rule, but eventually on the underlying legislation.  The process of moving this bill through the House began earlier this year, as I and a number of Members representing multiple committees talked about and debated different ideas and what we hoped for in a final piece of legislation. After hundreds of meetings with stakeholders on all sides of this issue, on both sides of the aisle,[[Page H8313]]and countless hours of work by Members and staff alike, I believe that the House stands ready to vote to improve the condition of our national forest land.  However, the hard work of everyone involved will be for naught if the Senate fails to act. For that reason, I encourage our colleagues in the Senate to take up this legislation, debate it, offer solutions, and act to make a difference on our national forests and our rural communities.  Mr.Speaker, let's be clear. Our national forests are in the poorest condition this Nation has ever seen, and will continue to degrade if we fail to act and complete the work that has started here. However, I believe that we have reason to be encouraged. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently held a hearing on a discussion draft that includes similar forest management provisions as H.2936, and I know the other committees of jurisdiction are working on forest reform legislation as well.                              {time}  1300  This is not only a forest health issue; it is a public health issue that demands action. Shame on us if we continue to stand idly by and watch our treasured national forests go up in smoke while people suffer and die.

Pass it and allow us to meet at conference and work out the differences. Let us present a workable solution to the President for his signature.

744,topic-id,2426,"Mr.Chair, I thank Chairman Bishop for his tireless efforts to see our government do better on our Federal lands.  Mr.Chairman, I recently made a trip out to Montana to visit some of our National Forests and the rural communities they border. These forests, much like many areas across our country, have been mismanaged for decades, and the ones that have not already been destroyed are ripe to be devastated by insects, disease, or catastrophic wildfire, not because of some action taken by the Forest Service, but just the opposite. Because of no actions, our forests are overstocked, underutilized, and unhealthy.  We have seen nearly 9 million acres of forest, an area larger than the State of Maryland, go up in flames just this year, spewing tens of millions of tons of carbon and thick smoke into the atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong. 32,000 full-time Forest Service personnel are busy and working hard trying to manage the 193 million acres of timberland across our great country, but they are spinning their wheels and making very little progress.  Mr.Chairman, that is a forest the size of Texas and South Carolina combined. According to scientists at the Forest Service, 80 million acres of that, an area the size of the State of New Mexico, is in a condition that is subject to catastrophic wildfire.  These fires are not only creating a forest health crisis, they are a public health crisis. They kill trees, they kill wildlife and livestock. These fires not only kill livelihoods, they create unbearable health concerns and living conditions with their thick smoke and ash. On top of all that, they are killing people.  It shouldn't be this way and it doesn't have to be this way.  This bill simply allows sound, scientifically-based forestry practices, like the ones I learned at Yale's Forestry School, to be implemented on our Federal forests. It will result in cleaner air, cleaner water, better wildlife habitat, better recreational opportunities, more plant and animal biodiversity, stronger economies, and fewer fires, resulting in lower fire costs.[[Page H8339]]  As we traveled through the beautiful countryside of Montana, I saw the symbol of our Nation perched majestically atop a tree by the bank of a clear and flowing stream. This bald eagle reminded me of a fable by Aesop that described our situation today. It goes like this:  An eagle was soaring through the sky, when suddenly it heard the whiz of an arrow and it felt itself wounded to death. Slowly it fluttered down to the Earth, with its lifeblood pouring out of it. Looking down upon the arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the haft of the arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes.       ``Alas!'' it cried, as it died, ``We often give our enemies      the means for our own destruction.''  Mr.Chairman, our enemies aren't our colleagues across the aisle. Many support this bill and some are cosponsors. Our enemies are not environmental extremists that are impeding science and causing some people to love our trees to death. Our enemy is not even the United States  Mr.Chairman, our enemy is catastrophic wildfire that destroys our forests. Our enemies are insects and diseases that kill our trees, and we are feathering their arrows with inaction. We are feathering their arrows with bureaucratic red tape. We are feathering their arrows with poor policy that are killing our forests, killing our communities, and killing us every day.  How much longer will we stand by and do nothing?  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get behind this bill, pass it out of the House, and join me in relentlessly encouraging the Senate to take action.  Our forests, our rural communities, our environment, and all those areas, urban and rural alike, that are breathing the smoke and ash of our once magnificent forests need us to act.  Every day that we delay, the problem gets worse and the enemies of the forest are gaining ground. Please join me in this fight and pass this bill.  Mr.Chair, I include in the Record two letters. The first is from eight groups, including the Archery Trade Association; the second is from the National Association of State Foresters, both in support of H.2936.                                                    June 26, 2017.     Rob Bishop,     Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee,     Washington,     Raul Grijalva,     Ranking Democrat, House Natural Resources Committee,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Bishop and Grijalva: Our organizations      which represent millions of hunters, anglers, recreational      shooters and other conservationists express our strong      support for H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of      2017. We respectfully urge you to take expeditious Committee      action on H.2936, which if enacted, will improve the      health of our federal forests and reduce costly wildfires.      Our nation's federal lands play a vital role in maintaining      healthy forests that are resilient to threats at a landscape      level from fire, pests, disease and insects. Through      incentives and expedited process, consistent with informed      science, the bill will help ensure that timber harvest and      the creation of young forest habitat for wildlife remains      viable on US Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land      Management (BLM) lands. Additionally, it remedies the budget      fire-funding problem (borrowing from other line items) that      our country faces when fighting catastrophic wildfires.       Our organizations much appreciate that the fire-funding      problem is addressed in HR 2936. While most catastrophic      fires occur in the western United States, this is a national      problem because the funds for every national forest and      public land unit are affected. This remedy will prevent the      USFS and BLM from having to borrow from other appropriated      budget line-items (for example, wildfire prevention,      wildlife, recreation and water quality) to pay for the cost      of catastrophic fire suppression, which cost now consumes      over 50% of the USFS budget. We respectfully urge the      Committee to further protect the USFS budget by capping the      10-year average of catastrophic fire costs at its current      level. The USFS uses this 10-year average to build their      budget request for the The 10-year average      continues to rise and unless it is capped it will continue to      erode other important budget line items such as wildlife,      water quality, fire prevention and recreation as the USFS      constructs its budget request.       All forest management plans are conducted with public      input, and all projects undergo National Environmental Policy      Act (NEPA) analysis. The bill's use of the Categorical      Exclusion (CE) under the NEPA rules from the Council on      Environmental Quality, will allow routine projects with known      effects to be implemented more efficiently and cost-     effectively to achieve the forest's desired future condition,      as outlined in the forest management plan. Certain forest      management treatments previously analyzed under NEPA in order      to deal with issues such as pests and disease, hazardous      fuels, critical habitats for threatened or endangered      species, salvage facilitation, and water quality, do not need      re-analysis on each similar project. These projects are      routine, reoccurring activities with known effects, already      fully analyzed and therefore qualify for CEs from repeated      analysis.       We also appreciate the increase in acreage ceilings for the      statutorily endorsed Early successional stage forest      habitat, for instance, cannot be just incidental to be      effective in providing habitat for deer, ruffed grouse, elk,      wild turkey, neo-tropical migratory songbirds and other      species which are dependent on this habitat type. While an      acreage ceiling is an easy metric to measure success, the      desired forest future condition should really determine the      size of the management activity. Additionally, as stated in      the bill, all CEs must avoid sensitive areas and must be      consistent with standards and guidelines in approved Forest            Our organizations appreciate changes made to make more      prominent in federal statute the states' authority to manage      fish and wildlife on USFS and BLM lands. Nothing in the bill      language is intended to change any existing federal, state or      tribal authority. It simply makes more evident the state-     federal jurisdictional relationship which Congress has      affirmed. Federal-state cooperation in this arena is      compelled because the USFS and BLM own the land and thus the      habitat, and the state fish and wildlife agencies manage the      fish and wildlife. Robust cooperation will provide that both      land/habitat objectives and fish and wildlife population      objectives are met.       Additionally, our groups support the proposed common-sense      amendments to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). First, the      bill overturns the Cottonwood decision, which directs that if      additional critical habitat is designated under an approved      forest plan or resource management plan, a section 7      programmatic re-consultation of the entire forest plan needs      to be done. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the      Obama Administration argued that the section 7 consultation      needs only to be done on the portion of the project covering      the additionally designated acreage of critical habitat. This      remedy will greatly reduce the debilitating process that the      federal court decision directs. Second, the bill affirms that      no ESA section 7 consultation is required if the USFS or BLM      determine during informal consultation that the proposed      action is ``not likely to adversely affect a species or      designated critical habitat'', which is already USFWS policy.      And third, if any consultation on a categorical exclusion      established by the bill is not concluded after 90 days, the      action shall be considered to have not violated section      7(a)(2) of the       We also support the bill's provisions expediting large      scale restoration after catastrophic wildfires. We likewise      support the prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary      injunctions. It is imperative that we work to restore      wildfire-impacted lands for the ecological health of the      immediate area and surrounding landscape, protection of the      watershed, and economic vitality of the local communities.       Our organizations further appreciate the process relief      provided to National Forest Plans and potentially Resources      Management Plans developed by collaborative deliberation. It      is appropriate that a collaborative-developed plan, which      often takes years to deliberate and conclude, be subject to      only two options under NEPA, proceed or not proceed. It is      very reasonable to assume that the collaboratively      deliberated process has examined and rejected the other      options, and only the action or no action alternatives need      be analyzed.       The bill's establishment of a pilot binding arbitration      process as an alternative to litigation in each Forest      Service Region is certainly welcomed. Not only is the cost of      defending the land management plan a burden on the agencies,      but the planned for management work on the ground is lost,      perhaps never to be resurrected on that site. We find much      merit in this improved approach as an alternative to the      proposal in H.2647 from the last Congress, and commend      Westerman and the Committee for settling on this.      Uninformed litigation has led to federal forest management by      the federal courts; we need to return forest management to      the federal and state professionals with public input as      provided for by the established processes.       H.2936 makes significant improvements to and would      expedite the process that governs approval of the USFS and      BLM management plans. We urge that your Committee      expeditiously report this bill from the Committee to the      House floor. We look forward to continuing to work with you      to move this bill quickly through the legislative process.       Thank you for your consideration of our community's      perspectives.

Chairman Rob Bishop,     House Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington,     Ranking Member Raul Grijalva,     House Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The      National Association of State Foresters (NASF) is pleased to      provide comments on the Resilient Federal Forests Act of      2017. NASF represents the heads of state forestry agencies in      all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the US      Through the development of comprehensive State      Forest Action Plans our members maintain a broad view of the      full set of forestry ownerships within their authority,      including federally owned forest lands. For citizens of the      United States to realize a full set of forest related      benefits, federal lands need to provide a complete and      balanced set of environmental, economic and social values.       In February of 2016 our organization adopted a formal      position on desired reforms to federal land management      policy. Suggestions are organized around:       Reforms that would allow federal lands to develop a more      balanced set of social, environmental and economic benefits;       Reforms that would lower the costs of agency      administration, planning, regulatory compliance and      litigation, and       Reforms that would enable vegetation management to be      carried out at a scope, scale and pace sufficient to create      more sustainable and resilient landscape conditions.       We feel this bill would indeed create the end results our      members support as our members want to see more active      management of federal forest lands. Expedited planning and      analysis, prompt response to catastrophic events, alternative      dispute resolution, greater collaboration and less costly      litigation are all outcomes that for which we strongly      advocate. In addition, we're encouraged to see some desired      modification to Good Neighbor Authority allowing road repair      to be part of cooperative projects, as well as support for      giving the land management agencies the opportunity to make      their own determinations of endangered species jeopardy or      adverse effects. Finally, NASF appreciates that this      discussion draft recognizes the need to solve the wildfire      suppression funding issue. We look forward to working with      the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands and      Congressman Bruce Westerman to ensure that a solution      addresses both fire borrowing and the erosion of the Forest      Service's budget over-time due to increasing wildfire      suppression costs.       We recently provided comments on federal land management      reform to the House Natural Resources Committee's      Subcommittee on Oversight and One additional      suggestion we made there and would repeat here is to      ``Require that National Forest Management Plans specifically      address how they support State Forest Action In      addition, encourage regular consultation with State Foresters      by National Forest System leadership to ensure their annual      programs of work are dovetailed where appropriate.''       Thank you for this opportunity to comment. We would be      happy to answer any questions or provide any additional      information that might be of assistance.

Unmanned aerial vehicles are an emerging technology that should be harnessed to benefit our Nation's forests. As a matter of fact, these unmanned vehicles are being used extensively by the private sector to look at their forests, to manage them, to equip them with remote-sensing equipment so that they can cover large areas at a large time and gather much more accurate data than you could actually do on the ground.  By ensuring that our land management practices utilize the cutting edge of available technology, we can ensure the prolonged health of our managed forests, and we can actually use this as a tool to cut down on the number of forest fires, and a better way to respond to those fires.

These are statutorily unique lands. They are all contained in the State of There are 2.6 million acres in 18 Oregon western counties.  The O&C Act directs the BLM to manage those lands for multiple uses, including sustainable timber harvest, reforestation, protection of watersheds. As Federal lands, counties with O&C acres are unable to collect taxes. The Federal Government realized that put a tremendous burden on the counties, and the revenues are shared 50 percent with the counties and 50 percent with the Federal These are critical revenues for my counties, and we have been trying to enhance management on those lands to help both with employment and with those revenues.  Without this provision, the bill would seem to open up wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, the national trail system, and other statutorily protected areas. It will also protect the Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area on Oregon's coast.

It has never been the intent of this bill to affect wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers. I believe we do have protections in place in the bill, but this reemphasizes that.  I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work as we worked through the process on this bill.

There are men and women around this Nation who work daily to protect our communities from the fires that devastate especially the Western United States, but they are not allowed to call themselves firefighters.  Instead of ``firefighter,'' the Forest Service, BLM, and other agencies use bureaucratic terms like ``forestry technician,'' which fails to recognize the dangers they face and the sacrifices they make to protect others.  My amendment, which I am pleased to offer with my colleague, Representative Mark DeSaulnier from California, represents a bill we have both sponsored, H.3907, as well; which seeks simply to designate these brave men and women the title they have earned by directing the Office of Personnel Management to create employee classes designated as ``wildland firefighters.''  Mr.Chairman, 15 ``technicians'' have passed away this last year fighting wildfires. Several of them are from It is unconscionable that, while they perished fighting fires, the agencies that employ them refuse to call them firefighters. We should take action to rectify that failure, and I urge Members to consider our bill, H.3907, to do so.

500,topic-id,2039,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today for the 184th time to ask us to at least wake up to our duty as a Congress to enact prudent policies to address the effects of climate change. The Presiding Officer is well aware of what Alaska faces from ocean acidification and ocean melting and sea level rise and all of that.  For the generations who will look back at this, I have tried in these speeches to chronicle the political tricks and bullying that have put Congress--the Congress of the United States--in tow to a massively conflicted special interest, such that we are incapacitated on this vital subject. The shamelessness of the fossil fuel industry and the spinelessness of Congress under its sway will provide a long lesson in modern-day corruption and political failure.  The Trump administration has been particularly loathsome, threatening the emissions standards for cars and trucks, pressing for the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, disbanding science advisory committees, lifting the moratorium on Federal coal leasing, trying to expand offshore drilling, and open national marine monuments and sanctuaries to energy companies. The Environmental Protection Agency is working to eliminate rules on the leaking and flaring of methane and has rescinded requirements for reporting methane emissions. The President has announced his intention to withdraw the U.from the Paris climate agreement.  One particular target of this corrupted administration is the Clean Power Plan, the 2015 EPA rule to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from American powerplants--a rule that many utilities and States supported. But it is the industry's bottom-dwellers who have the President's ear, and they want to undo even this flexible framework for meeting emissions-reduction targets.  When EPA balanced the costs and benefits of the Clean Power Plan originally, it offset things, like between $14 billion and $34 billion in health benefits in the form of preventive illnesses and deaths, against the costs of industry compliance.  The net benefits of the Clean Power Plan came out to between $26 billion and $45 billion every year.  So with its official proposal to rescind the Clean Power Plan, EPA administrator and fossil fuel operative Scott Pruitt had to cook the books to wipe out this public benefit. Here is how he did it. There were two tricks. One derives from the fact that harms, injuries, and losses caused by carbon pollution can take place many years after the pollution is emitted. In financial matters, future costs and benefits are balanced against present costs and benefits, using what is called a discount rate. It is more valuable to receive $1 million now than $1 million 20 years from now. That is the theory.  But even the George Bush administration recognized for healthcare rulemaking that ``[s]pecial ethical considerations arise when comparing benefits and costs across generations,'' and they urged care about using a discount rate when a rule is expected to harm future generations.  In 2015, the United States settled on a 3-percent discount rate to estimate the out-year costs of carbon pollution to society. Scott Pruitt jacked that up to a 7-percent discount rate so out-year harms, injuries, and losses would count for less. Mind you, our children and grandchildren will still suffer the exact same costs at 3 percent or at 7 percent. It is just that present-day polluters--Scott Pruitt's masters--get a way-big discount.  Pruitt's second trick is only to count the carbon pollution harm within our borders. You might say: That is OK; we are Americans, after all. But it is worth taking a look at what this rule does if all countries were to use it because there is a trick hidden in the middle of it. The fact is that we are harmed by other countries' carbon emissions, and they in turn are harmed by our carbon emissions. On the flip side, we harm other countries with our emissions, and they harm us with theirs.  There is a total amount of global emissions, and there is a total amount of global harm. If you call the total global emissions X and the total global harm Y, what happens when every country follows the Pruitt method of only pricing local emissions and local harms?  For purposes of illustration, let's say there are three countries in the world, and each emits one-third of the total carbon pollution and suffers one-third of the global harm from the collective global emissions. If each country only counts its own emissions and the harms only to its own country, guess what happens. All that cross-border harm never gets counted. It never gets counted. It disappears off the balance sheet. It vanishes into this trick of calculation. If you are the tool of the fossil fuel industry, how rewarding it must be to implement a trick that just vanishes so much of the fossil fuel industry's harm to the world.  In this hypothetical, how much harm simply vanishes? Two-thirds of it does. Two thirds of the harm simply vanishes, never to be accounted for--not in the real world. Nothing has changed in the real world. In this three-country hypothetical, the total emissions is still X and the total harm is still None of that has changed. This Pruitt trick of accounting just wiped two-thirds of the harm off the books. A happy day for polluters, and a happy, happy day for the polluters' tool, for there will no doubt be rewards for implementing this trick.  Those fossil fuel industry bottom-dwellers no doubt think that this is pretty cute and that this is pretty clever stuff, indeed. There are high-fives in the corporate boardrooms that they have a tool in office who will pull such a trick of magical, vanishing carbon pollution harms. But the problem with these crooked little schemes is that the whole world is actually watching. Anybody can do the analysis that I just did and show that this is nothing more[[Page S6948]]than a trick, and sooner or later, consequences do come home to roost.  Out in the real world, the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati is buying up land in Fiji so it can evacuate its people there when rising seas engulf its islands and eliminate the nation. It is on its way to becoming a modern-day Atlantis, lost forever to the waves. You can replicate that risk along the shores of Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia and the  You can add in the risk of lost fisheries that left a country's EEZ for cooler waters. If you think that is just a hypothetical, ask Connecticut and Rhode Island lobstermen about their catch. Add in the expansion of the world's desert areas in the Sahel and elsewhere that forces farmers' crops and shepherds' flocks away from their historic homes.  Add unprecedented storms powered up over warming seas. As bad as things have been in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico, we are rich enough to rebuild, to throw billions of dollars at the problem, and we are. Other places do not have those resources. Without the help, imagine that suffering.  To those who will suffer in the future, what do we say? On that day of reckoning, on that judgment day, what do we tell all those people who suffered? Ha-ha-ha, do we say? We came up with this little trick that wiped most of your suffering off our books. We used a discount rate that discounted your suffering to virtually zero. Is that the kind of America we want to be? Remember the saying: The power of America's example is more important than any example of our power. Some example we would be, some city on a hill, if that was the way we behaved.  The natural world does not care about self-serving or ideological arguments. The natural world is governed by immutable laws of physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics. Scott Pruitt's polluter-friendly mathematics just doesn't add up. As Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago who helped develop the social cost of carbon, put it, Pruitt's plan was not evidence-based policymaking. This was policy-based evidence making.  There is enormous pressure in the Trump administration to get rid of the social cost of carbon. What is bizarre about the Trump administration is that they don't try to get rid of the social cost of carbon by getting rid of its social costs, by lowering carbon emissions, by addressing the harms that it causes. They try to get rid of the social cost of carbon by getting rid of the scoring mechanism that counts all of that. It is like saying: My team is winning because I tore down the scoreboard.  Well, no, the world is getting clobbered out there by carbon pollution and the climate change that causes it, and tearing down the scoreboard doesn't help change the game on the field. You cannot just cook the books and reduce the social cost of carbon.  For one thing, the social cost of carbon analysis is too well established in the honest world. Courts have instructed Federal agencies to factor the social cost of carbon into their regulations. States are using the social cost of carbon in their policymaking. Most major corporations, even ExxonMobil, factor a social cost of carbon into their own planning and accounting.  The social cost of carbon pollution is at the heart of the International Monetary Fund calculation, for which the fossil fuel industry gets an annual subsidy in the United States of $700 billion a year. Even to protect a multihundred-billion-dollar annual subsidy, Scott Pruitt can't just wish the social cost of carbon away and just can't stop counting it. Courts will take notice.  They may take notice that these stunts are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure They may take note that Pruitt has massive conflicts of interest with his fossil fuel funders. They will surely note that the Supreme Court has said greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that EPA is legally obligated to regulate them. They will surely note that the EPA itself has determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations, a determination that the DC Circuit resoundingly upheld.  But we are not in an ordinary situation. Pruitt has a long history of doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry. In the recent Frontline documentary, ``War on the EPA,'' Bob Murray of Murray Energy, a strong Pruitt supporter, bragged about giving this administration a three-page action plan on environmental regulations and bragged that the first page was already done. That is the world we live in now, where the regulated industry brags that it controls its regulator, gives it direction, and that its work is already being done.  Courts that look at any rule proposed by Scott Pruitt must recognize that there is a near zero chance that he is operating in good faith. Our Nation's environmental regulator went in captured and has stayed captured by our Nation's biggest polluters. Scott Pruitt is not their regulator; he is their instrument. That is a conflict of interest.  I recently hosted my eighth annual Rhode Island Energy Environment and Oceans Day, bringing together members of our business community from the public sector, from government, and academia, to hear directly from experts about the latest environmental news and initiatives. I was very excited to be joined by excellent keynote speakers, including former Secretary of State John Kerry, who has done such magnificent work on oceans particularly but on climate change generally, leading us into the Paris climate agreement. Also, there was former U.Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern, who has labored in these vineyards so many years, and ocean advocate and Oceana board member Sam They were all great, but one phrase stood out.  Sam Waterston called on us to tackle today's ocean and environmental problems with what he called a ``battle-ready kind of optimism''--a ``battle-ready kind of optimism.''  So let us go forward with a ``battle-ready kind of optimism'' to clean the polluter swamp at EPA, to clean our Earth's atmosphere and oceans of unbridled carbon emissions, and to clear the reputation of our beloved country of the obloquy it is rapidly earning at the hands of a corrupting industry.

524,topic-id,2181,"Mr.President, the Janus decision coming up in the U.Supreme Court, which Senator Brown has just spoken about, is one that merits the attention of people who are concerned about the country and the  I wish to make two points in my remarks. The first has to do with the very difficult to explain--or at least very difficult to comfortably explain--pattern of 5-to-4 decisions of the U.Supreme Court, in which the five consist entirely of Republican appointees.  The Supreme Court makes a lot of decisions, of course. But there is something that is particularly interesting about the 5-to-4 decisions, where the five Republican appointees line up and roll the other appointees. When we start looking at those decisions, there are some really significant patterns that emerge. The first pattern goes to issues in which the court is treading into the world of politics.  Bear in mind that when Sandra Day O'Connor left the Court, it lost its only member who had ever run for office. What Justice O'Connor left behind was the first Court in the history of the United States that had exactly zero experience with elections and politics. There has never been as ignorant and green a Court in the history of the United States when it comes to politics; yet there has rarely been a Court so flagrantly eager to jump into politics and make very consequential decisions.  When we look at the 5-to-4 decisions--which I think are probably the bulk of those--each one aligns with the political interests of the Republican Party--each one. It is not one or two or even three. It goes on and on and on.  The oldest one in the series is probably Vieth v. Jubelirer, which was the decision in which the five Republicans said: This whole gerrymandering thing is just too difficult for us. We are going to declare open season. There is going to be no judicial remedy. We can't figure out one, so we don't have one.  It is not just me who is saying that. The ABA section on election law said in its volume: Look, basically, it is game over for court review of gerrymandering. What immediately happened after that was the Republican Party went to work with that green-light signal and did the REDMAP project, which created massive, bulk gerrymandering through the battleground This was not an easy plan because, in some cases, they had to spend millions of dollars to win one or two State legislative seats, so they could then control the State legislature, so they could then change the districts consistent with the bulk gerrymandering scheme.  The result is what happened in States like Senator Brown's, where, when he was reelected, he was on the ballot with President Obama, who was also reelected, and the majority of the votes cast in his State for Members of Congress were cast for Democrats, but against that background, many more Republicans than Democrats actually went to Congress in that election.  A similar thing happened in My recollection is that on the same set of facts, Senator Casey, a Democrat, was reelected; President Obama, a Democrat, was reelected; a majority of Pennsylvania votes were cast for Democratic Members of Congress; the delegation was 13 Republicans and 5 Somebody is messing around, and it was a 5-to-4 Republican Supreme Court that opened that can of worms and unleashed REDMAP on the political landscape.  They have a chance to review that now. Senator McCain has written a bipartisan brief asking them to wake up and smell the coffee about what has gone wrong here. We will see if they do or not, but, clearly, that was a decision that benefited the Republican Party's polls, and, clearly, it was 5 to 4.  Then you go to the Voting Rights Act cases. There were two of them. In the first one, Bartlett v. Strickland, the five Republican members teed up a new standard, which they mentioned, but they didn't really act on it. Then, when it came to the home run pitch, Shelby County v. Holder, they created this new theory about which very conservative judges, like Posner, said that, basically, it stands on thin air. It has no basis whatsoever in any real legal theory. They knocked out the part of the Voting Rights Act that requires States with a wretched history of abuse of minorities and Democratic voters at the polls to get preclearance from the Department of Justice or from a court before they can change their State laws to scare people or keep people away from the polls.  With that knocked out, guess what. All these legislatures across the South went straight to work. They passed law after law after law to deny people access to the polls, and over and over again, the courts that reviewed those and the appellate courts that reviewed the district court decisions found that the laws had been intentionally discriminatory, that the legislature had intended to keep people away from the polls, that they had intended to discriminate against Democrat and minority voters, and that they had chosen to do that deliberately.  Of course, you can go back after all that litigation and clean it up and try to get the laws stricken and all of that. But in the meantime, you have had election after election in which the effect at the polls was had.  They couldn't have been more wrong about the notion that if you lifted the preclearance requirement, everybody was going to be fine. Those were just the bad old days; it was a whole new America; racism didn't exist; efforts by one party to keep the other parties away from the polls weren't anything to worry about. Move along, move along; nothing to see here, folks. They were just plain dead wrong. They had absolutely no clue, and they have been proven dead wrong since. But, again, both of those cases were 5 to 4, all Republicans together.  Then, of course, the big whammy came when the big special interests that so often are the core backers of the Republican Party decided that they felt really constrained by having to live under campaign finance limits. They wanted to be able to spend unlimited money in elections. Well, that is fine. It reminds me a little bit of the story of the French philosopher who touted the majesty and equality of the French law, which forbid both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges and begging for bread. Well, guess who actually sleeps under bridges and begs for bread. It is not rich and poor. And guess who can take advantage of a rule that you can spend unlimited money in politics. Only those who meet two conditions: One, they have unlimited money to spend, and, two, they have a good reason to spend it. In other words, really big special interests.  The Court's decision, presuming that this spending was going to be either independent or transparent, has been turned into a mockery by events since. They obviously did not know what they were talking about. Facts have borne out that they did not know what they were talking about. They were completely dead wrong.  Interestingly, since then, despite the presumption of their decision having been cut completely out from underneath it, the Court has shown no interest in a correction. They have shown no interest in correcting their error. They seem completely happy, the 5 to 4--the five Republican appointees--completely happy to have the landscape of American politics polluted with this money.  There again, it wasn't just one decision. It was a bunch of them. Citizens United was the big one; Tradition Partnership, v. Bullock another; McCutcheon v. FEC yet another; Davis v. FEC yet another; Arizona Free Enterprise Club's FreedomClub PAC v. Bennett yet another--all 5 to 4, all the Republicans lining up, all throwing out precedent or laws that had stood for 100 years.  So Janus fits right into this pattern of 5-to-4 decisions. Indeed, it is actually a little bit worse because something weird happened early on when one of those 5 to 4--the Republican five Justices on the Supreme Court--signaled to the corporate supporters of[[Page S6960]]this ideology that he was interested in taking a whack at unions in a particular way.  There is a pet peeve of the union-busting rightwing and the corporate sector, which was a decision from 1977 called Abood v. Detroit Board of That decision allows unions to collect some dues from nonmembers on the grounds that their work for their members has benefit to other members. So you break out their wages work, which helps everybody, from their political work, which you can disaggregate from, and it allows you to collect certain dues--not complete dues, but certain dues--from nonunion members. What Abood did was to help unions keep revenues from the service that they give to nonmembers who benefit from their work. Without that rule, employees would be encouraged to be free riders and just get the benefit of what the union is doing without making any contribution to support it whatsoever. Of course, if that were to happen, the balance of power between corporations and unions would shift further toward corporations.  The story is told quite well in the New York Times by a reporter named Adam Liptak, who is a Supreme Court reporter. I will read his story.       In making a minor adjustment to how public unions must      issue notifications about their political spending, Justice      Alito digressed to raise questions about the      constitutionality of requiring workers who are not members of      public unions to pay fees for the unions' work on their      behalf. . . . Justice Sonia Sotomayor saw what was going on.      ``To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedence,'' she      wrote in a concurrence, ``is a step we historically take only      with the greatest caution and reticence. To do so, as the      majority does, on our own invitation and without adversarial      presentation is both unfair and unwise.''       Michael Carvin, a leading conservative lawyer, also saw      what was going on. He and the Center for Individual Rights, a      libertarian group, promptly filed the challenge Justice Alito      had sketched out.  I would say that he had invited.       Indeed, Mr.Carvin asked the lower courts to rule against      his clients, a Christian education group and 10 California      teachers, so they could high-tail it to the Supreme  Let me interrupt my reading of the story for a second and make the point that this lawyer wanted to lose his case in the lower courts. It is rare for lawyers to go into a court wanting to lose. You have to have kind of a weird motive to take a case into court that you want to lose. The obvious motive here is that Mr.Carvin had heard the signal from Justice Alito that he was willing to rule his way if he would just bring the right case. So it didn't matter whether he won or lost. Losing is actually quicker. It gets you right up to the Supreme He is not interested in litigating the matter truly on the merits; he is only interested in getting as quickly as possible to the Supreme Why? Because he knew that 5 to 4, he would get the right decision.  When you are a lawyer, the most sickening feeling you can have is to go into court with the belief that the judges you are going to argue before are prejudged against you. The confidence that Carvin must have had to want to lose a case deliberately below so that he could hightail it at high speed up to a court that he knew was going to rule his way because they told him they would--that is not American justice in the way it should be delivered.  As it turned out, they took up the case. It was called It was going to be 5 to 4, just as expected, and then Justice Scalia unexpectedly passed away. If you read about how the press took that, it was very clear that the fix had been in on this case.       ``Corporate America had high hopes,'' the Journal said,      because ``the Supreme Court appeared poised to deliver long-     sought conservative victories.''  Since when should a court be poised to deliver long-sought conservative victories, not fair, dispassionate adjudication? But that is the reporting of the friendly Wall Street And those long-sought conservative victories were going to take the form of `` `body blow[s] that business had sought against consumer and worker plaintiffs.' The cases `had been carefully developed by activists to capitalize on the court's rightward tilt.' ''  Come on. This is not adjudication any longer; it is just the exercise of political power. And these 5-to-4 partisan decisions by the Supreme Court are degrading the reputation of the Supreme Court, they are degrading the integrity of the Supreme Court, and they are degrading the role of the judiciary in our vaunted scheme of constitutional government in the United States of  With that, I yield to my distinguished colleague from  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945.txt,1823,RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT OF 2017,2017,1,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

300,topic-id,342,"Mr.President, over the past year, our Navy has had four serious mishaps at sea, including fatal collisions involving the USS Fitzgerald on one occasion and the USS John McCain on another. In the McCain and Fitzgerald accidents, 17 of our sailors were killed.  In response to these serious incidents, the Chief of Naval Operations, ADM John Richardson, directed the comprehensive review take place. Today, the Senate Armed Services Committee was briefed on the results of this comprehensive review. The results will be made public either tomorrow or the next day, and Americans will be able to see the serious situation we are in.  There are various reasons for these collisions and these fatalities, including, regrettably, human error and unfortunate circumstances, but, also, the review makes it clear that we are not doing right by our sailors, we are not doing right by the Navy, and we are not doing right by the taxpayers, in terms of making sure these brave men and women have what they need.  We need to work quickly with the Navy here in Congress to implement the recommendations that will be coming forward later this week. We need to enhance training and readiness, and we need to recognize--and I think the majority of this Senate does recognize--that the size of the fleet has contributed to the problems.  Simply put, we need to acknowledge that the Navy has a supply-and-demand problem. We have a demand for more naval action than the supply of our ships can produce. Our ship force has declined recently by some 20 percent. We are asking too few ships to do too many things for American security, and that needs to be rectified.  The consequences of this supply-and-demand mismatch were summed up by naval analysts Robert O'Brien and Jerry Hendrix in a recent National Review online article. They argue that the Navy is on the precipice of a ``death spiral,'' wherein more overworked and damaged ships place an increasingly greater strain on the remaining operational ships, thus eroding readiness across the fleet.

97,topic-id,1430,"Mr.Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (422) urging adherence to the ``one country, two systems'' policy as prescribed in the Joint Declaration between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of the Hong Kong, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              422       Whereas the People's Republic of China assumed the exercise      of sovereignty over the Hong Kong Special Administrative      Region 20 years ago, on July 1, 1997;       Whereas the Joint Declaration between the Government of the      United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Government of the      People's Republic of China on the Question of the Hong Kong      (in this resolution referred to as the ``Joint Declaration'')      required China's National People's Congress (NPC) to pass the      ``Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of      the People's Republic of China'' (in this resolution referred      to as the ``Basic Law'') consistent with the obligations      contained in the Joint Declaration, which was approved by the      NPC on April 4, 1990;       Whereas relations between the United States and Hong Kong      are fundamentally based upon the continued maintenance of the      ``one country, two systems'' policy stipulated in the United      States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-383; 22      U.S.5701 et seq.) and established by the Joint      Declaration;       Whereas under the ``one country, two systems'' policy      established by the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong ``will enjoy      a high degree of autonomy except in foreign and defense      affairs'' and ``will be vested with executive, legislative      and independent judicial power including that of final      adjudication'';       Whereas Hong Kong's autonomy under the ``one country, two      systems'' policy, as demonstrated by its highly developed      rule of law, independent judiciary, and respect for the      rights of individuals, has continued to make Hong Kong the      preferred residence for over 85,000 United States citizens,      and at least 1,400 United States businesses operate in Hong      Kong;       Whereas the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law declare      that the lifestyle and social and economic systems in Hong      Kong will remain unchanged for 50 years after the 1997      reversion;       Whereas the Basic Law guarantees Hong Kong residents the      freedoms of speech, press, publication, association,      assembly, demonstration, religious belief and activity,      academic research, and the rights to form unions and to      strike, among others;       Whereas the Basic Law also guarantees Hong Kong residents      the right to vote and to stand for election;       Whereas although the Basic Law states that ``the ultimate      aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal      suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative      nominating committee in accordance with democratic      procedures'', the actual process[[Page H8366]]     for nominating eligible Chief Executive candidates remains      heavily influenced by the Government of China;       Whereas widespread frustration with the lack of progress      toward a democratic selection of candidates for Chief      Executive provoked large-scale public demonstrations in late      2014, popularly known as the ``Umbrella Movement'', that      involved hundreds of thousands of demonstrators and the      occupation of certain public spaces for as long as 79 days;       Whereas, although Hong Kong continues to enjoy high levels      of economic freedom and judicial independence, certain recent      actions by the Government of China are inconsistent with its      stated commitments to Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and      the preservation of the rule of law;       Whereas international press reported that from October      through December 2015, four employees of Mighty Current      publishing house and its affiliated bookstore, Causeway Bay      Books, a Hong Kong seller of publications critical of Chinese      leadership, disappeared under suspicious circumstances from      Hong Kong, Thailand, and mainland China, in potentially the      most serious breach of the ``one country, two systems''      policy since 1997, which has had a chilling effect on the      freedoms of speech and publication in Hong Kong;       Whereas international press reported that--       (1) Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen and the co-owner of      Mighty Current, was last seen in Thailand in October 2015;       (2) The general manager of Mighty Current, Lui Bo, and the      business manager, Cheung Jiping, disappeared while on a visit      to mainland China around October 2015; and       (3) Lee Bo, who holds British and Chinese citizenship and      is a permanent resident of Hong Kong, disappeared from Hong      Kong on December 30, 2015;       Whereas Mr.Lui, Mr.Cheung, and Mr.Lee each briefly      returned to Hong Kong in March 2016 to ask Hong Kong police      to drop their missing persons' cases before immediately      returning to mainland China;       Whereas Lam Wing Kee, another Causeway Bay Books      bookseller, testified before the Congressional-Executive      Commission on China that he was detained by officials in      Shenzhen, China on October 24, 2015, moved to a detention      facility more than 1,300 miles away, and held incommunicado      and subjected to ``endless interrogation'' for seven and half      months, during which he was forced to produce multiple,      coerced confessions of ``selling books illegally'';       Whereas on November 7, 2016, while the Hong Kong High Court      was considering its final ruling to determine if the oaths      sworn by certain Legislative Council candidates were in      accordance with Article 104 of the Basic Law, the Standing      Committee of the NPC issued its own interpretation of Article      104 of the Basic Law in an attempt to foreclose the      opportunity for the legislators-elect to retake their oaths      and assume office;       Whereas that interpretation of Article 104 by the Standing      Committee of the NPC represented the first time it had issued      such an interpretation while a Hong Kong judge was      deliberating on the case in question and only the second time      it had done so in the absence of a request from Hong Kong      authorities;       Whereas according to the Hong Kong Bar Association, that      preemptive interpretation was ``unnecessary and      inappropriate'' and ``created the impression that the      [Standing Committee] is effectively legislating for Hong      Kong, thereby casting doubts on the commitment of the Central      People's Government to abide by the principles of `one      country, two systems' '';       Whereas on November 15, 2016, the High Court ruled that the      oaths taken by Yau Wai-ching and Baggio Leung Chung-hang were      invalid, and barred the two from serving as members of the      Legislative Council;       Whereas on December 16, 2016, then Chief Executive Leung      Chun-ying and Secretary of Justice Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung      filed for judicial review of the oaths taken by Lau Sui-lai,      Nathan Law, Leung Kwok-hung, and Edward Yiu Chung-yim;       Whereas on July 14, 2017, the High Court ruled that the      oaths taken by Lau Sui-lai, Nathan Law, Leung Kwok-hung, and      Edward Yiu Chung-yim were invalid and barred the four of them      from serving as members of the Legislative Council;       Whereas in August 2017, the Hong Kong Government appealed      the original sentences of three ``Umbrella Movement''      leaders, Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow and asked for      prison time after they had already completed their previous      community service sentences;       Whereas the Hong Kong Court of Appeal subsequently imposed      prison sentences on Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow of      six, seven, and eight months respectively, which effectively      bars them from running for political office for five years;      and       Whereas these developments have called into question Hong      Kong's highly developed rule of law, independent judiciary,      and respect for individual rights, which are fundamental to      its way of life and economic prosperity: Now, therefore, be      it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes, consistent with the United States-Hong Kong      Policy Act of 1992, that--       (A) Hong Kong continues to play an important role in      today's regional and world economy, with strong economic,      cultural, and other ties to the United States;       (B) respect for civil liberties, open markets, rule of law,      and judicial independence are all integral aspects of Hong      Kong's lifestyle and social and economic systems; and       (C) the authority of the United States Government to treat      Hong Kong as a non-sovereign entity distinct from China, for      the purposes of United States laws relating to trade,      finance, transportation, economic and cultural exchange,      travel, law enforcement cooperation, export controls, and      other matters, depends on Hong Kong remaining sufficiently      autonomous; and       (2) urges adherence to the ``one country, two systems''      policy established by the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law      with respect to--       (A) Hong Kong's exercise of a high degree of autonomy;

I was happy to join him as an original cosponsor of this important measure.  During a recent trip that I led to Hong Kong, I heard firsthand how measures like this are helpful in keeping the pressure on Beijing to keep its commitment to the Joint  Twenty years have now passed since the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of At the time, the U.Congress played a vital role in the continuity of the U.relationship with Hong Kong by passing the Hong Kong Policy Act in 1992. This act established that the U.would treat Hong Kong as a nonsovereign entity distinct from China on commercial, cultural, and law enforcement matters so long as it remained ``sufficiently autonomous.''  Since the handover, Hong Kong has continued to be a global economic force and a financial hub. In recent years, however, it has also begun to face increased social, economic, and political challenges, including external pressures.  Mr.Speaker, we saw the Umbrella Movement protest in 2014, which was led by youth seeking to liberalize the electoral system and introduce true universal suffrage to Hong Kong in accordance with the Joint Declaration between Great Britain and In the intervening years, we have witnessed booksellers kidnapped from Hong Kong, Thailand, and Mainland China; legislator oaths being invalidated; and the jailing of protest leaders.  For many of us here in Congress, there is growing concern about the apparent increased role of Beijing in the affairs of Hong Therefore, Mr.Speaker, it is important to reiterate here today that our special treatment of Hong Kong is dependent upon it remaining sufficiently autonomous. We want to see Hong Kong's highly developed rule of law, independent judiciary, and respect for individual freedoms remain as the lifeblood of Hong Kong and its economic prosperity as guaranteed, again, by China and Great Britain in the Joint  Passage of this resolution demonstrates our support for the continuation of the ``one country, two systems'' policy in Hong Kong, so I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure.

I would think China, as they move forward, would look hard to honor their commitment that they made because it is not just Hong Kong they are influencing. It is all of the other countries in the world, and it will determine future negotiations on how China, Beijing, honors their commitment that they made with Hong Kong that the other nations will look at.  Hong Kong plays an important role in today's regional and world economy. Its open market and strong rule of law have served as an example to the region of how freedom and a rules-based society can foster a positive environment for its people's happiness and prosperity.  The U.has benefited greatly from strong economic cultural ties to Hong Kong, and I would venture to say, the world has benefited from that. We want to continue this relationship, but to do so, Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autonomous.

897,topic-id,885,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in support of a fellow Hoosier, Amy Coney Barrett, who has been nominated by President Trump to serve on the U.Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh  Professor Barrett's credentials are well known. She is a mother of seven children, a distinguished legal scholar at the University of Notre Dame Law School, where she herself graduated with high honors and served as editor of the Notre Dame Law She clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court of the United States and Judge Silberman on the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, and she is an expert on the Federal courts.  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the left have made an issue of Professor Barrett's Catholic faith. Echoing what Leader McConnell has said, we do not have religious tests for office in the United States of America, period.  I applaud all of those who have spoken up as the Senate weighs Professor Barrett's confirmation. That includes Notre Dame president, John He expressed deep concern at the questioning of Professor Barrett's faith. Following Professor Barrett's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Reverend Jenkins wrote: ``It is chilling to hear from the United States Senator that this might now disqualify someone from service as a federal judge.''  The president of Princeton University has also asked the Senate to avoid a religious test in judicial appointments. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, President Eisgruber wrote that Professor Barrett and all nominees ``should be evaluated on the basis of their professional ability and jurisprudential philosophy, not their religion.'' He wrote: ``Every Senator and every American should cherish and safeguard vigorously the freedom guaranteed by the inspiring principle set forth in Article VI of the United States Constitution.''  Despite the rhetoric surrounding Professor Barrett's nomination, I have yet to hear any significant doubts about her legal qualifications.  Professor Barrett has made clear that her personal views will have no bearing on her rulings as a judge. She brings the skill set and the temperament needed for the job. She will rule according to the law and according to controlling precedents, and she will be faithful to the There is no question that Professor Barrett will make an outstanding appellate judge.  Also, 450 former students signed a letter to the Judiciary Committee in support of Professor Barrett's nomination. They wrote: ``Our support is driven not by politics but by a belief that Professor Barrett is supremely qualified.''  All 49 of her fellow faculty members at Notre Dame Law School did the same. They said:       We have a wide range of political views, as well as      commitments to different approaches to judicial methodology      and judicial craft. We are united, however, in our judgment      about  Their endorsement comes as no surprise since Professor Barrett has served on committees dedicated to bettering the lives of students, faculty, and employees of the University of Notre  In particular, she has dedicated her time to the professional development of women. She serves on the University of Notre Dame's Committee on Women Faculty and As the faculty adviser for Notre Dame Law School's Women's Legal Forum, she has twice been recognized by her students with the Distinguished Teaching Award, which is selected by the graduating class to honor a faculty member. She was selected twice to receive that award.  One former student, Conor Dugan, shared his story about her willingness to help him navigate the next steps of his career right after law school. He said that despite not having Professor Barrett for a big class, she wrote him back right away and took time out of her busy schedule to help someone who was no longer at the school.  Conor says Professor Barrett has always been very responsive and a generous mentor over the years. Most importantly, he said, she tries to help people keep their perspective about the most important things in life.  Judge Silberman, for whom Professor Barrett clerked on the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, had the following to say about why she will make an outstanding Federal judge:       She is an honorable and straight as an arrow woman. She      looks at the law without preconceived notions, and she's      brilliant. She is the only law clerk I ever had from Notre      Dame, and she is as smart as any law clerk I have ever had.      She is compassionate, and she has a lively sense of rumor.  Judges, former law students, fellow law professors, and even the American Bar Association, who rates Professor Barrett as ``well qualified,'' all seem to agree that she is well suited for the job.  Now, being nominated to serve in a lifetime appointment for a U.circuit court of appeals is a privilege few in the legal profession will ever attain. This is a historic opportunity, as Professor Barrett would be the first Hoosier woman to have a seat on the Seventh Circuit  I offer my strong support for Professor Barrett's nomination, and I look forward to the Senate's confirming her today.[[Page S6907]]  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.
