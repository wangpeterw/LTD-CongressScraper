             CONGRATULATING REVEREND DR. JONATHAN L. WEAVER

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
Reverend Dr. Jonathan L. Weaver on his 30th pastoral anniversary.
  As the pastor of the Greater Mt. Nebo African Methodist Episcopal 
Church, which was founded 140 years ago, Reverend Weaver provides 
outstanding spiritual leadership in Maryland's Fourth Congressional 
District and the entire region.
  Pastor Weaver has a deep and active faith, and lives that faith not 
just with words, but with deeds. He has committed his life to lifting 
up people--to feeding the hungry and caring for the poor, comforting 
the afflicted and making peace--where there is strife. He has overseen 
not only the church's growth, but the charitable works of more than 50 
ministries that serve its members and the wider community.

  Pastor Weaver has led missions to Africa, serves as national 
president of a 500-church ecumenical association, and board chairman of 
the oldest and largest African-American community bank in the national 
capital region.
  Mr. Speaker, as Reverend Weaver continues his service to our 
community, I am confident that he will continue ``to do justice, and to 
love kindness, and to walk humbly with our God.''
