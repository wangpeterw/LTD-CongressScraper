                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Spirit, on this January 6, when a Joint Session of Congress 
is set to count electoral votes, ending officially the 2016 
Presidential election, we pause to acknowledge Your sovereignty over 
the affairs of humanity.
  Grant to this Nation a social conscience built on the vision of the 
ancient prophets who saw sufficiency for every person and a time when 
goodwill toward all would overcome fear.
  Lord, hasten the day when the small and weak can make their 
contributions alongside the great and powerful. Lead us to the day when 
we will see peace among the nations of the Earth, when swords shall be 
beaten into plowshares.
  Let Your glory cover the Earth as the waters cover the sea.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
