                              GOP TAX SCAM

  (Mr. NADLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans are scamming America. They 
are offering a facade of lowered taxes that you probably will never see 
in exchange for massive and permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 
Americans and corporations.
  And for what?
  We are told the corporate and upper income tax cuts will result in 
more investment and greater economic growth, which will yield more jobs 
and more revenue for the country and higher wages for the middle class.
  But this is bunk. They have run this scam twice before. Reagan passed 
similar upper class tax cuts and told us the tax cuts would generate 
such economic growth that they would pay for themselves.
  What happened?
  The national debt--accumulated from George Washington through Jimmy 
Carter--went from $800 billion in 1980 to $4.3 trillion 12 years later, 
and growth was less than under President Clinton.
  George Bush's tax cut turned an anticipated 10-year $5.65 trillion 
surplus into a $10.63 trillion debt in 8 years.
  And 3 or 4 years from now, Republicans will use the $1.5 trillion to 
$2 trillion deficit this scam will create to say: Look at this massive 
deficit. We have to make savage cuts to Social Security, Medicare, 
education, and infrastructure.
  That is what they are building in now. The Republicans are scamming 
America, and we must reject this bill.
