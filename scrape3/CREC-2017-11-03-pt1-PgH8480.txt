                 TAX PLAN GIANT STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MESSER. Madam Speaker, Hoosier families deserve a pay raise, and 
that is what President Trump's tax plan is going to give them: more 
jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for working Hoosiers.
  Importantly, the plan includes a provision that I have been working 
on that would stop $4 billion to $7 billion in refundable tax credits 
paid out each year to illegal immigrants. This is a giant step in the 
right direction to protect American taxpayers and American families. In 
the Trump tax plan these savings will help increase child tax credits 
for American citizens by $600 each child.
  Hoosiers get it. It is past time to address an immigration system 
that rewards people who come here illegally. No one should get a tax 
incentive to violate the law.
