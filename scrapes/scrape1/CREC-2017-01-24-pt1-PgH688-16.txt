           By Mr. GOSAR:
       H.R. 660.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1 (the Spending Clause). The 
     Supreme Court, in South Dakota v. Dole (1987), reasoned that 
     conditions and limitations on funds were constitutional and 
     within the power of Congress under the Spending Clause.
       Article 1 Section 8 Clause 3 (Commerce Clause) If the 
     matter in question is not a purely local matter (intra-state) 
     or if it has an impact on inter-state commerce, it falls 
     within Congress' power to ``regulate commerce among the 
     several states.''
       Article 1 Section 8 Clause 18 (the Necessary and Proper 
     Clause) which grants Congress the power to make all laws 
     which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into 
     execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested 
     by this Constitution of the United States, or in any 
     Department or Officer thereof.
