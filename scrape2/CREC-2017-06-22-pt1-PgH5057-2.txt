                 IN MEMORY OF PATRICIA LUCILLE McKENZIE

  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Patricia 
Lucille McKenzie, of Garden City, Michigan. Patricia passed away on May 
31, 2017, and is dearly missed by her many family and friends, 
including her husband of 55 years, Doug McKenzie, and her children, 
Pamela, Barbara, Phil, and Marcia, as well as her 12 grandchildren.
  In her 78 years, Patricia was devoted to her loving family, her 
faith, and to her strong belief in the principles of American 
democracy. She is also remembered for her love of her dog, Patty Lou, 
and, of course, for her passion for the Montreal Canadiens.
  Patricia's story is the story of countless Americans: a hardworking 
person, a patriotic citizen, a loving wife, and a devoted mother.
  To Patricia's many family and friends, I hope that during this 
difficult time you will find comfort in the knowledge that she has been 
called home in peace and harmony. Remember that Scripture tells us 
``the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your 
hearts and your minds.''
  Mr. Speaker, our friend, Patricia Lucille McKenzie, will be dearly 
missed, but we go on to remember and honor her legacy, just as she 
would want us to do.
