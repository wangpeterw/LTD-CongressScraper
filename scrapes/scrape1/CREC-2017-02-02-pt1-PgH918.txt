                       VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, we all know that human trafficking is a 
major problem right here in the United States. It is happening in every 
one of our communities.
  This week, as millions of Americans gather to watch the Super Bowl, I 
would like to shine a light on another troubling fact, and that is that 
there is an increase in the human trafficking and sex trafficking in 
the days surrounding the Super Bowl.
  Last year, in a few weeks leading up to the Super Bowl event, the 
Santa Clara Sheriff's Office identified 42 potential victims of sex 
trafficking during a series of stings and cited 30 additional men for 
soliciting prostitution.
  The good news is, Mr. Speaker, we are drawing attention to this fact 
and working hard to end this heinous practice. Next year, my home State 
of Minnesota will be hosting the Super Bowl, and our host committee is 
already working hard in collaboration with Federal and local law 
enforcement, with government agencies, with advocacy groups and 
victims' service organizations to develop a comprehensive and 
coordinated plan to address the issue. That is because, Mr. Speaker, 
over the next year, we will continue to end the practice of human 
trafficking, working tirelessly, and this is a wonderful opportunity to 
showcase how we can have freedom from the ugliness of trafficking.
