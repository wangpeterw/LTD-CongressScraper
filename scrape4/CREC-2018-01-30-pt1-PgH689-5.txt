               HONORING A GREAT AMERICAN ON HIS BIRTHDAY

  (Ms. CHENEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a great American on 
his birthday: my dad, Dick Cheney.
  I can imagine no better role model than this good and great man. He 
loved his time serving in this Chamber as the gentleman from Wyoming. 
Throughout a career spanning decades, including during some of the most 
challenging times our Nation has faced, he was a steady and wise hand 
who always led with the courage of his convictions.
  No matter the burden he carried, he has always been there for us as a 
listener and teacher. He taught my sister and me to love our country, 
to read history and learn from it, to listen more than you talk, that a 
man's word should be his bond, and that we owe all we have as Americans 
to the brave men and women in uniform who fought and died to keep us 
free.
  Madam Speaker, the gratitude I have for my dad as an American is 
surpassed only by my love for him as his daughter.
  Happy birthday, Dad.
