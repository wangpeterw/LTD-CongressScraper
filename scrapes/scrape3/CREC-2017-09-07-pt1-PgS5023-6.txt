  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a joint 
resolution at the desk that is due a second reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the joint resolution by 
title for the second time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 49) condemning the violence 
     and domestic terrorist attack that took place during events 
     between August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, 
     Virginia, recognizing the first responders who lost their 
     lives while monitoring the events, offering deepest 
     condolences to the families and friends of those individuals 
     who were killed and deepest sympathies and support to those 
     individuals who were injured by the violence, expressing 
     support for the Charlottesville community, rejecting White 
     nationalists, White supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-
     Nazis, and other hate groups, and urging the President and 
     the President's Cabinet to use all available resources to 
     address the threats posed by those groups.

  Mr. McCONNELL. In order to place the joint resolution on the calendar 
under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the joint 
resolution will be placed on the calendar.
