                             COPS AND KIDS

  (Mr. BUDD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, our policemen and -women wake up every day and 
do a job that is dangerous and often thankless. They are truly servants 
of the public and protectors of those who cannot help themselves. If 
that weren't enough, I wanted to speak briefly today to highlight 
officers who have gone even further.
  Mr. Speaker, the Iredell County Fraternal Order of Police recently 
held a Cops and Kids event in Mooresville, North Carolina. Through 
their generosity, more than two dozen families got around $100 worth of 
toys, clothes, and gifts for their loved ones. The stories of struggle 
for these families, brightened by a moment of generosity, are the 
stories we see around the country this Christmas.
  I am awed and humbled by the efforts of these officers. I want to 
especially congratulate Tommy Chipman, president of the Iredell County 
Fraternal Order of Police; Duck Wyatt, the second vice president; and 
all those who participated to help make this Christmas a better one for 
families in the community.
