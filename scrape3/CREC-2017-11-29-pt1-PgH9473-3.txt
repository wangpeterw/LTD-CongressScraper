                            HATE CAN'T WAIT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this morning, to quote a great 
American poet and civil rights leader, a great writer, a noble 
American, ``And Still I Rise.''
  And still I rise, Mr. Speaker. I rise to take a stand on behalf of 
the many people who suffer harm as a result of those who incite hate. 
Anyone who incites hate is a person that ought to be called upon to 
either stop it or be removed from a position such that they can harm 
society.
  So I rise today to take a stand against those who would incite the 
bigot to practice bigotry, those who would incite the racist to 
practice racism, the sexist to practice sexism; the

homophobe to practice homophobia, the anti-Semite to practice anti-
Semitism, the Islamophobe to practice Islamophobia.
  There are those who think that hate can wait, Mr. Speaker. I am not 
one of them. When hate emanates from the highest office in the land, 
when hate emanates from a person who has more power than any other 
person in the world, when hate emanates from the Presidency, the 
solution is impeachment.
  Impeachment will be voted on before Christmas. I rise to stand 
against hate.
