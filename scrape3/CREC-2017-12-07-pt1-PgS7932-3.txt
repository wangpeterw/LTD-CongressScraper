   SENATE RESOLUTION 352--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF DECEMBER 3 THROUGH 
   DECEMBER 9, 2017, AS ``NATIONAL NURSE-MANAGED HEALTH CLINIC WEEK''

  Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 352

       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit, 
     community-based health care sites that offer primary care and 
     wellness services based on the nursing model;
       Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, 
     promotion, and optimization of health, the prevention of 
     illness, the alleviation of suffering, and the diagnosis and 
     treatment of illness;
       Whereas an advanced practice nurse leads each nurse-managed 
     health clinic, and an interdisciplinary team of highly 
     qualified health care professionals staffs each nurse-managed 
     health clinic;
       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of 
     services, including treatment for acute and chronic 
     illnesses, routine physical exams, immunizations for adults 
     and children, disease screenings, health education, prenatal 
     care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;
       Whereas, as of September 2017, approximately 500 nurse-
     managed health clinics provided care across the United States 
     and recorded more than 2,500,000 patient encounters annually;
       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health 
     care safety net by expanding access to primary care and 
     chronic disease management services for vulnerable and 
     medically underserved populations in diverse rural, urban, 
     and suburban communities;
       Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health 
     clinics experience high patient retention and patient 
     satisfaction rates, and nurse-managed health clinic patients, 
     compared to patients of other similar safety net providers, 
     experience higher rates of generic medication fills and lower 
     hospitalization rates;
       Whereas the 2013 Health Affairs article ``Nurse-Managed 
     Health Centers and Patient-Homes Could Mitigate Expected 
     Primary Care Physician Shortage'' highlights the ability of 
     nurse-managed health clinics to bring high quality care to 
     individuals who may not otherwise receive needed services; 
     and
       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offering both primary 
     care and wellness services provide quality care in a cost-
     effective manner: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week of December 3 through December 9, 
     2017, as ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';
       (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed 
     Health Clinic Week; and
       (3) encourages the expansion of nurse-managed health 
     clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may continue to 
     serve as health care workforce development sites for the next 
     generation of primary care providers.
