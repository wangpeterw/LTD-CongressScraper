                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, as we join our hearts in prayer, we praise You for 
protecting and preserving this land we love.
  Remind our lawmakers that by themselves, they aren't sufficient for 
the challenges of our times. Give them the wisdom to solve the problems 
that require more than human ingenuity. May they never fail to do the 
very best they can, striving to please You in their every endeavor. 
Lord, when they are perplexed, provide them with the clarity of Your 
guidance. May Your will be done and Your purposes carried out above 
party and personality.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
