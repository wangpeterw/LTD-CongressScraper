                 ZERO MAJOR LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, here we are 9 months into the year, and the 
Republican-led Congress has zero major legislative accomplishments to 
show for it. While Democrats continue to offer an agenda that gives 
Americans a better deal, really a better life, Republicans are 
continually obsessed with their Republican healthcare bill, this repeal 
and replace.
  Recently, they have had to pull back again from their Graham-Cassidy 
approach to this. Why? Because it means less care, less coverage, 
higher premiums, higher copays. It is bad policy. We ought to be 
focusing on what we need to do to make it right to fix the problems we 
see in healthcare, not this obsession to check a political box and 
repeal healthcare for the American people.
  Meanwhile, there is no infrastructure plan. America's roads and 
bridges are falling apart. There is nothing on the floor of the House 
to address that--something the American people all agree we need to do. 
There has been nothing done to make sure that 800,000 DREAMers are not 
deported away.
  They have a tax plan that rewards 5,400 American families with a 
quarter of a trillion dollars in tax breaks. This is the wrong 
direction for America.
