                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Bob MacGregor, City Harvest Church, Vancouver, Washington, 
offered the following prayer:
  Lord, we come today with thanksgiving for the work of Your grace in 
establishing this at work called America.
  Known around the world as the Nation of opportunity, many fight to 
become a part of us and few desire to leave because You, Lord, have 
made us great.
  Our Founding Fathers understood this by experience and by the 
Scriptures ``that except the Lord builds the House, they labor in vain 
who build it.'' So it has been our deep conviction from our conception 
to daily appeal to You for wisdom to guide the leaders of this great 
Nation.
  So, once again, we ask for the wisdom to protect all our citizens, 
provide opportunity for all, help our poor, care for our elderly, 
secure our families, educate our children, and make our economy strong.
  We pray for unity in this endeavor. May righteousness exalt us 
through all our laws. This we ask respectfully in Jesus' name.
  Amen.
