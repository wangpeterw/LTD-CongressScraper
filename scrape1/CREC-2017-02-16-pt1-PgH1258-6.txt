            TRUMP'S MUSLIM BAN AND TOWN HALL IN THE DISTRICT

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I hosted a community listening 
session where my fellow citizens and I listened to the personal 
experiences of Muslims, refugees, and other immigrants in the aftermath 
of the President's Muslim/immigrant ban and ICE dragnet crackdown on 
Latinos.
  It was a safe place for Muslims, refugees, and immigrants to come and 
share their experiences, values, and love for this country, and it 
provided an opportunity for us to embrace our fellow citizens in love. 
We insist that these valuable members of our community and their 
children be able to live without fear, and to thrive.
  Unlike the Muslim/immigrant ban, the people of Georgia's Fourth 
Congressional District welcomed those of all backgrounds and religions 
and those fleeing persecution and facing war and bloodshed.
  Trump's immigration executive order is contrary to our values and 
dangerous to our security. Americans who respect the Constitution must 
oppose these kinds of acts, the injustice they represent, and the 
suffering that they impose upon the innocent.
