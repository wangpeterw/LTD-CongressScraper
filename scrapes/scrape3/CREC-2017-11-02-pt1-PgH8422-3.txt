                          REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I stand against Republican 
efforts to give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest citizens and big 
corporations while robbing the pockets of middle class families and 
ransacking Medicare and Medicaid.
  My constituents are worried. Just ask Marion, who uses Medicare to 
buy her costly diabetes drugs, or Sherry, whose husband has Alzheimer's 
and lives in a nursing home paid for by Medicaid.
  Americans want a better deal, one that invests in infrastructure, 
education, and innovative research and lowers the costs of things like 
child care and prescription drugs.
  We want better jobs, better pay, and a better future, not more 
giveaways to hedge funds and conglomerates.
