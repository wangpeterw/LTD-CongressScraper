                                  FISA

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in just a short while, the Senate will 
vote to reauthorize important provisions of the FISA Amendments Act. As 
we all know, section 702 remains one of the most important tools that 
our national security professionals use to combat terrorism and to keep 
Americans safe.
  Let's be very clear about what section 702 does. It enables our 
intelligence community to collect communications from foreign 
terrorists on foreign soil who threaten America and our allies. That is 
what it does. Make no mistake--section 702 does not allow the targeting 
of American citizens, nor does it permit the targeting of anyone, no 
matter their nationality, who is known to be located here in the United 
States.
  The men and women we trust to protect this country say that this 
capability is essential to their missions. They tell us that it has 
saved American lives. That is why we cannot let this capability lapse. 
The world remains dangerous. We need our Armed Forces and intelligence 
community to protect us, and they need us to give them the tools to do 
it.
  I look forward to renewing this important provision on a bipartisan 
basis in a short while.
