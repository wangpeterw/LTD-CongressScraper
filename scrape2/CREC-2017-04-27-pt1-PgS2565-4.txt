                      WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN

  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank Pastor Marty Sloan 
for delivering the opening prayer in the Senate today.
  Pastor Sloan is the lead pastor of Harvest Time, one of the most 
active and well-attended houses of worship in Arkansas's second largest 
city of Fort Smith, which is the city in which I grew up.
  Pastor Sloan is also a proud husband and father and plays an 
important role in the life of the Fort Smith community. As the lead 
pastor of Harvest Time, he has a passion for caring for his 
congregation and those in the larger community through preaching, 
teaching, and counseling in order to encourage and build up their faith 
and develop meaningful relationships with Christ and one another.
  For 22 years, Pastor Sloan has been in ministry and has focused on 
both national and international missions. He has also been involved 
with the Live Nativity on Capitol Hill and the National Day of Prayer 
and has conducted pastoral conferences in America, Peru, and Armenia. 
Pastor Sloan says that one of his greatest joys is to ``pastor from the 
center of the room'' because his desire is to lead his congregation by 
walking through life together with them.
  Serving as the guest Chaplain is an incredible honor. I am thankful 
for Pastor Sloan's ministry, and I am so pleased he could be here to 
offer an invocation of asking God to guide and bless the efforts of 
Congress and America's leaders.
  I yield the floor.
