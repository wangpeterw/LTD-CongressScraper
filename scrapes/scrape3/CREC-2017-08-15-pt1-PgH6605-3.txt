                                 PRAYER

  Monsignor Stephen Rossetti, Catholic University of America, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Gracious God, it is right for us to begin this session and all of our 
lives recognizing You, the source of all that is just and good.
  Today, may we recognize the many ways we have failed to do what is 
just and good.
  We implore Your divine mercy for ourselves and for our Nation.
  May we return to Your ways; fervently seeking to do what is just and 
what is good, thus acting in conformity with You.
  Thank you for hearing our prayer, You who are our merciful God.
  Amen.
