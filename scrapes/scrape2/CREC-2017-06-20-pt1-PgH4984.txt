            RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AWARD

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize George 
Logothetis, the CEO and chairman of the Libra Group, a private 
organization based in my congressional district that is dedicated to 
bolstering local communities through educational and business programs.
  George is a visionary who recognizes the value of promoting startup 
businesses as a catalyst for financial self-sufficiency, economic 
development, and job creation. In 2015, George created the American 
Entrepreneurship Award, a nonprofit with one goal in mind: to make free 
enterprise accessible to every underserved community across our Nation.
  This Friday, June 23, George will host AEA's annual awards ceremony 
in our home city of Miami, where George will announce the winners of 
the 2017 Business Plan Competition from Miami and the Bronx. The 
awardees will receive a cash prize as well as vital consultation and 
mentorship to get their new business ventures off the ground.
  I would like to thank George for his leadership in promoting 
innovation, and I look forward to his future success, as well as the 
AEA's.
