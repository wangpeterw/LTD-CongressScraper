 CONGRATULATING THE BALTIC STATES OF ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA ON 
      THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR DECLARATIONS OF INDEPENDENCE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 356, S. Res. 432.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A resolution (S. Res. 432) congratulating the Baltic states 
     of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on the 100th anniversary of 
     their declarations of independence.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the 
resolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign 
Relations, with an amendment, as follows:
  (The part of the resolution intended to be stricken is shown in 
boldface brackets and the part of the resolution intended to be 
inserted is shown in italic.)

                              S. Res. 432

       Whereas, in 1918, the people of Estonia, Latvia, and 
     Lithuania declared their independence on February 24, 
     November 18, and February 16, respectively, as sovereign, 
     democratic countries;
       Whereas, on July 28, 1922, the United States formally 
     recognized Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as independent 
     countries;
       Whereas the United States refused to recognize the Soviet 
     Union's forcible incorporation of the Baltic states;
       Whereas, in August 1991, the Baltic states regained their 
     de facto independence from the Soviet Union, and on September 
     2, 1991, President George H.W. Bush recognized the 
     restoration of their independence, reestablishing full 
     diplomatic relations between the United States and Estonia, 
     Latvia, and Lithuania several days later;
       Whereas, in the United States, communities of Baltic 
     descent have contributed significantly to American culture, 
     prosperity, and security and have helped strengthen United 
     States relations with the Baltic states;
       Whereas relations between the United States and Estonia, 
     Latvia, and Lithuania have developed into a robust 
     partnership based on shared values and principles, including 
     respect for the rule of law, human rights, freedom of speech, 
     and free trade;
       Whereas Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have shown their 
     resolve as responsible and dedicated members of the North 
     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by contributing to 
     regional and global security, including to operations in 
     Afghanistan;
       Whereas the Baltic states have been leaders in addressing 
     and combatting 21st century security threats, exemplified by 
     their active leadership and advancement of the NATO 
     Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Estonia, 
     the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence in 
     Latvia, and the NATO Energy Security Center of Excellence in 
     Lithuania; and
       Whereas Russia's continued aggressive and provocative 
     actions against its neighboring countries, including 
     violations of sovereign Baltic airspace, test both the region 
     and the NATO alliance: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) congratulates the people of Estonia, Latvia, and 
     Lithuania on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of their 
     declarations of independence;
       (2) commends the people and Governments of Estonia, Latvia, 
     and Lithuania for their successful reforms and remarkable 
     economic growth since 1991;
       (3) applauds the productive partnership the United States 
     enjoys with the Baltic states in many spheres, including 
     NATO;
       (4) recognizes the determination of the Governments of 
     Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to strengthen transatlantic 
     security through defense spending and host nation support for 
     NATO deployments;
       [(5) recognizes the commitment among the Baltic states to 
     further respect for the values of democracy and human rights 
     within their own countries and abroad; and]
       [(6) reiterates the continued support of Congress]
       (5) commends the Baltic states for their commitment to 
     democracy and respect for human rights and for their 
     leadership in furthering these values abroad; and

       (6) reiterates the continued support of the Senate for the 
     European Deterrence Initiative as a means for enhancing 
     deterrence and increasing military capabilities on NATO's 
     eastern flank.

  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported 
amendment be agreed to, the resolution, as amended, be agreed to, the 
preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
