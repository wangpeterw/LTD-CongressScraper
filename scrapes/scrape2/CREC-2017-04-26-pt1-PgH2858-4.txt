 CONGRATULATING CONGRESSMAN STIVERS AND CONGRESSMAN WENSTRUP ON THEIR 
                               PROMOTIONS

  (Mr. TIBERI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two Members of our 
congressional delegation, and two of my friends, Congressman Steve 
Stivers and Congressman Brad Wenstrup, upon their military promotions.
  Now Brigadier General Stivers in the Ohio National Guard, and Colonel 
Brad Wenstrup in the United States Army Reserve, they both have served 
their country beyond the boundaries of their district.
  Today I am humbled and honored to join my colleagues in 
congratulating them on their distinguished public and military careers.
  Congressman Stivers, 30 years ago as a young Buckeye, assumed the 
title--one very important to him and to us--as citizen soldier.
  In 1998, Congressman Wenstrup joined the U.S. Army Reserve after 
already establishing himself as a doctor in the Cincinnati area.
  To Congressman Stivers and Congressman Wenstrup, as faithful 
Representatives to your constituents, as members of our military, and 
veterans of the Iraq war and recipients of the Bronze Star, you have 
always put service to our country first.
  Thank you from a grateful Congress and a grateful nation. 
Congratulations on your respective promotions.

                          ____________________
