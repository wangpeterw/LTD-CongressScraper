       SUPPORTING THE RUSSIA, IRAN, AND NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS ACT

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 3364, the Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act.
  These sanctions are critical to countering aggressive and 
destabilizing actions by Russia, Iran, and North Korea, sending a 
strong message at a critical moment.
  Iran has continued its illegal ballistic missile program, its support 
for terrorism, and its atrocious human rights record; North Korea has 
continued to pursue its dangerous development of nuclear weapons; 
Russia has maintained its aggression in Ukraine, its illegal occupation 
of Crimea, and its destabilizing actions in Syria.
  These sanctions also send a long overdue response to the Kremlin's 
attacks on our elections here at home. I commend this body for coming 
together on this important American national security issue. I call 
upon the Senate to pass this legislation and for the President to sign 
it.
