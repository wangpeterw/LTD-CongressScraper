                           WE MUST DO BETTER

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I have been 
listening daily to heartbreaking stories from real people about their 
health challenges and what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would 
mean to them.
  People like Peter Morley, who survived cancer and now lives with 
lupus--he won't be able to afford his lifesaving infusions if repeal 
happens.
  For Baby Theo, born with two holes and an enlarged kidney, the return 
of lifetime caps would mean the loss of insurance for him.
  And Red Raccoon, an Iraq war veteran suffering from PTSD, he relies 
on Medicaid to supplement the inadequate VA system.
  Each of them and millions more will suffer if repeal or replace goes 
forward. I believe we are a greater, more caring nation than this. I 
believe we can, we shall, we must do better.
