  INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO BAN BUMP STOCKS TO CONVERT SEMIAUTOMATIC 
                                WEAPONS

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, 58 innocent people were murdered in Las 
Vegas. Their killer used 12 bump stocks to convert his semiautomatic 
weapons into the equivalent of a machine gun.
  No one should possess one of these devices, let alone 12 of them, and 
that is why I am introducing legislation to ban them.
  But I am mindful, Mr. Speaker, that we have been here before after 
Newtown, Aurora, San Bernardino, Orlando, and other mass shootings. 
Each time, my Republican friends have refused to act.
  Now, in the wake of the worst mass shooting in modern history, our 
Republican colleagues are not only refusing to act, but they are going 
to make the problem even worse by pressing proposals that will make the 
problem worse, making it easy to carry a concealed weapon, making it 
easier to buy a silencer. I mean, this is insane.
  I get it. Elections have consequences. You won last November so you 
get to do what you want, but this is wrong. Let's come together and do 
something. And I promise you, if Congress fails to respond to the 
demand for commonsense gun safety legislation, we will be held to 
account by those we serve, and rightly so. So let's work together and 
do something.
