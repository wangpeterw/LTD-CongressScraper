                 RECOGNIZING DONALD AND SHARON CAMPBELL

  (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to thank Donald and Sharon 
Campbell, who have actively volunteered for more than a dozen years at 
the Valatie Ecumenical Food Pantry, a ministry of the Ichabod Crane 
Clergy Association in Columbia County.
  With Don serving as chairman from 2006 to 2017, the leadership of 
these two honorable individuals has enabled the food pantry to serve 
hundreds of families in northern Columbia County. Utilizing grants, 
community donations, local farms and markets, the Campbells have truly 
supported their less-fortunate neighbors, enabling those folks to 
better support their families and loved ones.
  Don and Sharon's efforts extend beyond the food pantry, aiding many 
other charitable pursuits in our community. We thank them as well as 
the volunteers of the Valatie Ecumenical Food Pantry for their gracious 
service to our Columbia County community.
