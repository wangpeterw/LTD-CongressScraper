                        SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY

  (Mr. O'HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support Small Business 
Saturday on November 25.
  Small Business Saturday takes place every year on the Saturday after 
Thanksgiving. It is a day for Americans to support their community and 
their local businesses. As a former small-business owner myself, I know 
the value that our small, locally owned businesses add to our local 
economy.
  Arizona is the proud home of more than 500,000 small businesses that 
employ nearly 1 million Arizonans. These small businesses are the 
lifeblood of our local economies, and they are vital to the future of 
our communities. Our entrepreneurs are local community leaders. They 
hire local employees and they contribute to local causes.
  This holiday shopping season, we have the chance to show appreciation 
for our local businesses and all they do for our communities. I 
encourage all Americans to go out and shop at their favorite local 
small businesses or dine at their favorite local restaurant and support 
Small Business Saturday on November 25.
