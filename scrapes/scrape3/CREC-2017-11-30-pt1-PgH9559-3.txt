              HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN MAURICE HINCHEY

  (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and sorrow that I 
rise today to announce the passing of our former colleague, Congressman 
Maurice Hinchey.
  Mr. Hinchey passed away on November 22, just before Thanksgiving, at 
the age of 79 in Saugerties, New York, leaving behind an extraordinary 
legacy that was marked by fervent patriotism, political courage, and 
forward-thinking leadership.
  During his 20 years of service in the House of Representatives, 
Maurice Hinchey represented a broad swath of New

York State, from the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains, over in 
the Southern Tier as well. Many of those areas make up what is today's 
19th Congressional District, which I currently represent.
  I also had the honor of working alongside Mr. Hinchey for 6 years in 
the New York State Assembly. There, he developed and honed his 
legislative skills as chairman of the assembly's Environmental 
Conservation Committee.
  We proudly note the service of Maurice Hinchey to the Nation, and I 
am glad to be joined here by colleagues from the New York delegation 
and the dean of the delegation, Ms. Slaughter, to extend our heartfelt 
condolences to Maurice Hinchey's widow, and to the entire Hinchey 
family.
