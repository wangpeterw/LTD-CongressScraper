                TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL MARTA FORD

 Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, today I wish to honor an Iowan who 
served bravely during the Vietnam war as an Active-Duty nurse and spent 
nearly three decades in the Army Reserves.
  LTC Marta Ford grew up in the small town of Killduff in Iowa's Jasper 
County. Her father was a World War II veteran who served as a 
bombardier, flying missions over Europe. She decided to join the Army 
Nurse Corps at the age of 19, while still in nursing school. Ford 
underwent basic training in 1966 at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. Then, 
she was stationed at Fort Lee in Virginia. Ford served as an Active 
Duty member of the Army Nurse Corps until 1969 and remained in the Army 
Reserves until 1975. She rejoined the Reserves in 1980 and served until 
retirement in 2004.
  Currently, Ford serves her local community as chair of the Jasper 
County Commission of Veterans Affairs. In 2013, Ford became the first 
female commander at the American Legion Post 111 in Newton, IA.
  She is just one of the many women and Iowans who served our Nation 
during the Vietnam war era. All those who honorably served deserve our 
thanks for their service to our country. I ask my colleagues to join me 
as I proudly recognize LTC Marta Ford, an Iowan who dedicated her life 
to service and sacrifice on behalf of this great Nation.
