                         COMPACT IMPACT RELIEF

  (Ms. BORDALLO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to reintroduce my Compact 
Impact Relief Act with my colleagues from Hawaii and the Northern 
Marianas as original cosponsors. Our bill would provide relief to Guam 
and other States and territories required by the Federal Government to 
provide local public services to more than 76,000 migrants under the 
Compacts of Free Association.
  Guam remains the top destination for Compact migrants from the three 
freely associated States. Our island accommodates nearly 18,000 out of 
a population of just 175,000.
  As the United States looks to renew the Compacts after 2023, Congress 
must increase mandatory Compact impact funding to affected 
jurisdictions like Guam. Congress should provide the funding level 
recommended by the Government Accountability Office, as I have called 
for repeatedly.
  In the meantime, I hope this House will act on the practical policy 
changes included in my Compact Impact Relief Act.
