11554,topic-id,942,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Arrington, for this Special Order and for this opportunity to talk about what makes America great.  Mr.Speaker, I am a product of rural I did learn a lot about work ethic and about values. I can't think of any other way to grow up, to be honest with you. Sure it was difficult, and sure I probably had some times where I thought I would like to be somewhere else. But I will tell you, there was nothing like it, and I take and cherish those memories. I have tried to instill those in my children as well.                              {time}  1745  It is the greatest honor of my life to represent the people of Georgia's 12th Congressional District, which is largely rural. We have 18 counties. About 15 of those counties would be considered rural. My district is home to the Masters Tournament and the growing cyber industry in Augusta, but it is our rural farms that are the true heart of my district.  Georgia's 12th District is rural, and I am proud to say it is truly God's country. You won't find more steadfast, faithful Americans than in rural  Agriculture is the number one industry in my home State of It is also the number one industry in my district. Our farmers have been forgotten by out-of-touch politicians and unelected bureaucrats here in Washington, particularly over the last 8 years.  Farm income, for example, is down more than 55 percent, largely due to what our President has talked about, which is our trade policies. However, as of last November, we are approaching a new day. This is President Trump's day and President Trump's That is why I am proud to have a President that knows that rural Americans deserve more.  In April, President Trump created the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity to be led by Secretary of Agriculture and fellow Georgian, Sonny This task force was created with one goal in mind: to promote economic growth and innovation in rural As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I look forward to working with Secretary Perdue on this mission, as well as the next farm bill, which is critical to the lifeblood of our farmers.  From looking at cotton to peanuts, to specialty crops and the programs they are using, I have participated in numerous hearings on how to make the next farm bill successful for all of our farmers. I am working hard to make sure the commodities most important to Georgia's 12th District are protected.  We also have a crisis in our community banking system. Community banks are the lifeblood of the creation of small business. We continually lose our community banks. That is why I am so proud of Chairman Jeb Hensarling and his work to pass the CHOICE  The CHOICE Act reduces the regulatory burden on our community banks. It allows them to thrive and to provide the capital to grow the small business community in our rural areas. Small business in our rural communities accounts for about 75 percent of all new job growth.  We also have to fix healthcare. We are losing a number of our community hospitals. I know in Congressman Arrington's district, in small towns, the community hospital is the largest employer in that community, and it is critical that we repurpose those hospitals, that we fix healthcare and we provide healthcare for our rural areas.  We also need to look at technology. There is a tremendous need for broadband and expanding our broadband capabilities. I know the President is talking about a major infrastructure package. Broadband needs to be a part of that infrastructure package because the 12th District of Georgia, through technology, could be the new Silicon Valley of the East We would like to see that trickle down into our rural areas, and it can, but we have to have the capability of the broadband.  As far as the future of rural America, we are seeing tremendous strides made as far as technology, as far as farming. Last year, I planted peanuts. I was operating a tractor, which I remember operating as a child and a teenager and having to pay attention to all the moving parts. I tell you, I sat on this tractor and I planted 17 inches over from the year before, and I never touched the steering wheel. The technology is amazing.  I was with a group of farmers the other day and we were talking about God is blessing us with a lot of rain and if it continues, we are going to have a bountiful crop, a great yield. They said: Yeah, we are good 8 inches down, but the other 8 inches we are a little concerned about. They have these probes that are measuring how much water we are receiving.[[Page H6283]]  So we have a got a lot going on in our rural areas. We just, as a body here, need to provide our farmers, our small business people, with the tools they need to get the job done, and they will get the job done.  Again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Texas, Congressman Arrington, for shining the spotlight on rural America tonight. It is the lifeblood of this country. I want to see rural America become everything it needs to be.  We are seeing improvement in the economy through many pieces of this legislation that we are passing. I hear it from the business community and some of our city centers. It is time for that to trickle down into rural  Again, I thank the gentleman for shining this spotlight.

For example, the federal government has wrongfully issued hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits to individuals without first verifying their immigration status. After the money goes out the door, the Internal Revenue Service must attempt to track down these individuals to recoup the money.[[Page H4883]]  Last year the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs reported that more than $750 million in taxpayer dollars went to 500,000 people who did not meet the qualifications for those benefits.  H.2581 addresses this issue by requiring that the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services to certify that an individual is a citizen, national, or legal immigrant before they receive a health care tax credit.  Given that our nation is nearly $20 trillion in debt, we cannot afford to hand out hundreds of millions of dollars in Obamacare tax credits to individuals who do not qualify.  This bill is a common-sense measure that puts the interests of hardworking taxpayers first and ensures that health care dollars will be directed only at those who are eligible.

11591,topic-id,1276,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and working with me on this important issue. I also thank leadership for recognizing this issue and working with me to fix the problem.  I am proud to rise today in support of my bill, H.2581, the Verify First  My bill is intended to stop fraud in the distribution of healthcare tax credits and protect taxpayer dollars. It is simple: the American people expect that we are verifying that someone qualifies for taxpayer money before that money goes out the door.  This is about the Federal Government being good stewards of the money our constituents send to Every Federal dollar that goes to someone committing fraud is a dollar that is not going to a person who truly needs and deserves assistance.  No one should be allowed to commit fraud at the taxpayers' expense. No business would give a refund without first verifying a receipt.  Yet this is exactly what is happening under our current healthcare system. The law claims that taxpayer money will only go to people who qualify for it. Yet no one is being held responsible for making sure that that happens. My bill does that.  Under current law, the Federal Government pays tax credits to individuals without first verifying that they qualify to receive them. If individuals cannot verify their legal status, the IRS is then forced to chase after the money.  This pay-and-chase model of distributing tax credits has greatly increased costs to the taxpayers. A 2016 Senate report revealed that, under ObamaCare, $750 million in taxpayer-funded healthcare subsidies went to people who did not qualify for those benefits.  We could fix this problem and save time and money so that IRS agents are helping people, instead of trying to recover improper payments by verifying legal status first.  My bill simply requires the IRS to work with the relevant Federal agencies to verify that an individual is a[[Page H4878]]citizen, national, or lawfully present in the United States before tax credits go out the door. This can be done by verifying an applicant's Social Security number or other immigration documents. Again, the American people expect that we are already doing this.  Under my bill, everyone who applies for the advance premium tax credit will be verified for legal status. Most people won't even know that this is happening because the verification check is so quick.  My bill also includes protections that ensure that individuals who are legally entitled to these tax credits are not penalized if there is a delay in verifying their documents. I first raised this issue last year with the previous administration. I am raising it again this year because there is no evidence that anything has been done to address it.  Nobody wanted to take responsibility for mismanaging $750 million of taxpayer money. Everyone pointed fingers at other people. My bill holds people accountable.  While I received assurances from the current administration that it would implement and follow a process to verify legal status, my bill would require it in law. This issue is too important to be left to the changing positions of unelected Federal bureaucrats. The American people deserve to know that their representatives are doing everything in their power to protect taxpayer money.  The Verify First Act provides that certainty and upholds the integrity of the health insurance premium tax credit by putting an end to fraud and abuse.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the cosponsors of my bill for their support. They include Diane Black, Mo Brooks, Jeff Duncan, Jimmy Duncan, Mike Kelly, Doug Lamborn, Mike McCaul, David McKinley, Kristi Noem, Jim Renacci, Mike Rogers, Lamar Smith, Jason Smith, G.Thompson, and Joe  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from NumbersUSA and FAIR, two groups that have been working with me to protect the interests of the American worker and legal immigrants.                                                   NumbersUSA,                                      Arlington, VA, May 23, 2017.     Lou Barletta,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Barletta: NumbersUSA, on behalf of our      more than 8 million activists, applauds you for introducing      the Verify First Act to ensure that health care tax credits      are not paid to illegal aliens or other disqualified aliens.      As you know, NumbersUSA opposed the ineffective verification      provisions in the Affordable Care Act because we knew they      would result in taxpayer-funded subsidies being sent to      illegal aliens. Our concerns, unfortunately, were confirmed      by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental      Affairs, which reported that more than $700 million in      Obamacare subsidies had been paid to ineligible aliens by      2015. Like you, we recognized that these same ineffective      verification procedures in the American Health Care Act      (AHCA) would result in the payment of health care tax credits      to illegal or otherwise ineligible aliens.       The Verify First Act will require the Social Security      Administration (SSA) and the Department of Homeland Security      (DHS) to actually verify the citizenship or immigration      status of every applicant for a credit under the AHCA before      the Treasury Department issues the credit. Both SSA and DHS      have established, proven methods of verifying status in a      timely and efficient manner, including the E-Verify system,      which relies on data from these two agencies to verify work      authorization, and the Systematic Alien Verification for      Entitlements (SAVE) system, which uses DHS data to establish      welfare eligibility.       Hard-working Americans and legal residents already are      struggling to pay for their own health care. There is simply      no excuse for the Federal government to force them to      subsidize health care for illegal aliens through taxpayer-     funded credits.       For this reason, NumbersUSA is delighted to support your      Verify First Act and we look forward to working with you to      make sure it is enacted into law. We also applaud House      Republican Leadership and the House Ways and Means Committee      for working with you to close this expensive loophole in our      health care system.           Sincerely,                                                     Anne Manetas,     Vice President,                                  ____                                           Federation for American                                           Immigration Reform,                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2017.     Lou Barletta,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Barletta: On behalf of the Federation for      American Immigration Reform's (FAIR) nearly 1.5 million      members and supporters nationwide, I am writing to thank you      for introducing the Verify First This important piece of      legislation would deny health care tax credits to illegal      aliens and ensure that Americans' hard-earned tax dollars      only go to those with a valid Social Security number (SSN).       As you know, federal law explicitly prevents illegal aliens      from receiving tax credits. Despite this, a recent report by      the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs      Committee found that nearly 500,000 illegal aliens received      approximately $750 million in taxpayer-funded health care      subsidies as of June 2015. Under Obamacare, the federal      government pays health care tax credits on a ``temporary      basis'' to individuals who are unable to verify their      citizenship. If an individual is ultimately unable to verify      their immigration status, the funding is suspended and the      Internal Revenue Service (IRS) attempts to recoup      overpayments from the individuals who were wrongly covered.      This challenging practice--known as ``pay and chase''--is      costing taxpayers millions.       As a complement to the recently passed American Health Care      Act, your legislation ensures that the IRS has verified that      an individual is a citizen, national, or lawfully present in      the United States before the advance health insurance premium      tax credit is disbursed. This will be done by checking an      applicant's SSN or other immigration documents. Additionally,      your legislation prohibits the use of the Individual Taxpayer      Identification Number (ITIN), which are issued without      verification of legal status.       For the aforementioned reasons, FAIR applauds you for      introducing the Verify First When this important piece      of legislation is considered on the House floor, FAIR will      include the vote in our voting report.

By eliminating the practice of      providing advance payments while an applicant's immigration      status is being verified, this bill stems the flow of      payments to ineligible individuals under Obamacare and      strengthens the ability of the Administration to ensure      premium tax credits will be appropriately provided to      eligible individuals under the American Health Care Act of      2017 (AHCA).

11808,topic-id,503,"Mr.Speaker, when former President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank financial control law into law about 7 years ago, supporters promised that it would repair the economy; they promised that it would end too big to fail; they promised it would enhance financial stability and protect consumers. But none of those promises have been kept.  Nearly 9 years after the financial crisis, Americans are still stuck in the slowest, weakest economic recovery in 70 years. The percentage of Americans who are actually in the workforce is at its lowest level since the late 1970s, and we still have not fully reached the potential of our economic recovery. This is precisely because of the Dodd-Frank law. The Dodd-Frank law has clogged the plumbing of our economy with an avalanche of red tape.  Far from ending too big to fail, Dodd-Frank has guaranteed that too-big-to-fail banks will get a taxpayer bailout whenever they go into distress.  As big banks have gotten bigger as a result of Dodd-Frank, the small banks, the community banks, the credit unions--the credit providers for the entrepreneurs, the small businesses, the job creators in this country--are fewer. That is a huge problem for the dynamism of the economy, and that is one of the reasons why we haven't seen economic recovery the way that we should.  Dodd-Frank has made it more difficult for small businesses and startups to obtain capital to grow, invest, and hire. Before Dodd-Frank, small business lending was more than 150 percent of large bank lending. Today, due to Dodd-Frank, small bank lending is about 80 percent below that of large bank lending. This is why new business formation is at a generational low, because small businesses and startups and entrepreneurs have much more success obtaining capital from community banks than Wall Street banks.[[Page H4669]]  Financial services and products have been impaired. Since Dodd-Frank, the number of banks offering free checking has shrunk from 75 percent to 37 percent, the ranks of the unbanked have gone up, and one in five community banks in my home State of Kentucky have disappeared as a result of Dodd- Consumer protection? Taking away financial services and products, eliminating competition and choice from the marketplace, eliminating free checking, taking away access to credit, that is not protecting consumers. That is hurting consumers. Dodd-Frank is the worst bill for consumers that we could possibly have.  We need the Financial CHOICE Act, which will preserve access to financial services and products and give consumers access to mortgages and access to financial products like credit cards and overdraft protection and home equity loans. All of these services and products are going away because of Dodd-Frank and the busybodies in  We need to protect consumers. There is nothing wrong with effective regulation, but this is regulation gone awry. It is unaccountable, it is not transparent, it is hurting the American consumers, and it is certainly not adding to financial stability when big banks and Wall Street are getting bigger and our community banks are going away.                              {time}  1345  ",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4664.txt,2238,200TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLONEL SYLVANUS THAYER,2017.0,7.0,July

11661,topic-id,897,"Mr.President, Republicans have been warning for years now about the grave damage ObamaCare has done to the American healthcare system. We have pointed out how the healthcare law's regulations are destabilizing the health insurance industry. We have warned that the ObamaCare markets are unstable. We have talked about the death spiral which has already doomed  It seems like every day we get more proof that the collapse is well underway. Last week, the insurance company Aetna announced it was exiting the individual ObamaCare markets entirely. CNN did a story about this last The headlines said: ``Aetna to ObamaCare: We're Outta Here.'' It is interesting because Aetna as a company was one of the cheerleaders for ObamaCare early on; they jumped in and said: We are very involved. We want to make this work. Here they are pulling out, saying it has failed.  Humana had already said it was quitting the exchanges, not just one place but everywhere.  In the past month or so, we have seen big companies drop out of the markets in Virginia and in There is now just one company left selling in the exchanges for Nebraska and for There is just one company selling in Alaska, in Missouri, in Alabama, in Oklahoma, in South Carolina, and in my home State of  For people living in all of these States, there is a monopoly for whom they get to buy their insurance from under the ObamaCare markets. That is not a marketplace, it is a monopoly.  The Associated Press looked at all of these companies dropping out. It now found that 40 percent of America--4 out of 10 counties in America--will have just 1 company selling insurance in the ObamaCare exchanges for next year; 4 out of every 10 counties in That is what you get with an ObamaCare exchange.  How is that supposed to bring down prices? Other companies have been saying how much they will need to charge if they are going to stick around for 1 more year under It looks like we will have another year of incredible price increases. In Maryland, insurance companies are demanding average premium increases of anywhere between 18 and 59 percent. In Connecticut, they are asking for 15 to 33 percent more next year.  Democrats are desperate to blame the collapse of ObamaCare on President My question to the Democrats is this, What about all of the companies that dropped out of the marketplaces last year? What about the double-digit price increases Americans were paying year after year under ObamaCare?  The premium for the average benchmark plan in the exchanges went up 25 percent at the start of this year. Are Democrats going to try to blame that on someone else?  In March, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported the results of a poll on healthcare in In this poll, 4 out of 10 American adults with insurance under ObamaCare said they have trouble affording their deductible. They have ObamaCare insurance, but 4 out of 10 adults in America with ObamaCare insurance are having trouble affording their deductibles. Three out of every ten with insurance under ObamaCare said they have problems paying their medical bills. One in four Americans with insurance under ObamaCare said the costs have forced them to put off healthcare they needed or skip it entirely.  These people are suffering because of President Obama and the Democrats and what they passed. These Americans are struggling because of the flawed policies and regulations of the ObamaCare law that Democrats in Washington wrote.  Republicans are saying what we have said all along: Healthcare reform should be about helping people get the care they need, from a doctor they choose, at a lower cost. We need to do something to rescue the people who are being crushed under this collapsing ObamaCare system. That is why Republicans are the ones talking about solving the problems that have been caused by The House of Representatives passed a bill that includes some important things that could help stabilize the markets. It includes things to stop these double-digit premium hikes that have been occurring every year.  In the Senate, we have already started mapping out the ideas. We are going to continue offering our ideas. We are going to continue debating them. I want to invite Democrats in the Senate to come to the floor and offer their ideas as well. It doesn't have to be a partisan fight. It shouldn't be a partisan fight that drags on for months and months. We need to find solutions for the American people who are suffering under President Obama's healthcare law.  For all the Democrats who are now trying to redirect the blame away from themselves, the problems they caused, trying to pass the buck, we are trying to pass a bill. I can tell from listening at home in Wyoming, where I will be again this weekend and was last weekend, people know who caused the problems of The American people are looking for solutions. They don't care who offers it. They want solutions. I think if we can get a bipartisan solution, all the better. I invite the Democrats to come to the floor to give us their best ideas.

11849,topic-id,5608,"Thank you, Mr. I appreciate very much the comments from my colleague from Massachusetts and my colleague from  I notice my colleagues from the other side of the aisle are not here tonight to defend this piece of legislation. It doesn't surprise me, given what is in this legislation and given what we have heard over the last week.  The Senator from Massachusetts was explaining what it was we were trying to do when we passed the Affordable Care Act, now years ago. Part of what we were trying to do was to extend coverage to a lot of Americans that didn't have it. In my State of Colorado that meant over 600,000 Coloradans who didn't have it before the Affordable Care Act was passed. Another thing we were trying to do was to say to insurance companies that it is not OK to have as your business practice that you take month after month after month of premiums from people and then when they call on the phone and say: My kid was sick; my kid got struck by lightning; my kid had an accident, to then hold them on the phone as long as possible just as a way of denying their claim. Most people in America are too busy trying to move their family ahead, trying to get by, to stay on the phone all day with an insurance company. While we were at that, we said: It is not fair to deny people insurance in the richest country in the world because they have preexisting conditions. It is not fair that it is a business plan in America to have lifetime caps on people in the richest country in the world who might hit those lifetime caps because they get cancer. It is not fair that in America, the richest country in the world, some seniors have to cut their medicines in half every month just to get through the month and to pay their bills. These were some of the issues that we were trying to address when we passed the Affordable Care  Mr.President, I am from a Western State, like you. I was out all those months in Colorado, having town hall after town hall, not just in Democratic parts of the State but in Republican parts of the State, trying to explain what it was we were trying to do--both to give people better coverage, more predictable coverage, and less costly coverage and also to try to do something to bring down healthcare costs in this country. We succeeded at some of those things. We didn't succeed at others of those things. It was a legitimate attempt at trying to deliver something for the American people that people all over the industrialized world don't have to live with.  Only in this country do people have to make choices about feeding their family and taking care of their kids at the doctor. Only in this country do seniors have to make choices about cutting those pills in half. Only in this country do people have to make choices about paying their rent and taking care of their kids. It doesn't happen in the rest of the industrialized world. Before I hear it from the other side tonight, let me say: Our results are getting worse, not better. For populations across this country, longevity is actually getting shorter, not longer. This is a difficult, complex, but urgent question for our country.  That is what we were trying to do with the Affordable Care Some of it succeeded and some of it didn't. I will talk more about that in a minute.  For 8 years Republicans ran for election after election after election on ObamaCare: ObamaCare is socialism; ObamaCare is a Bolshevik plot to take over the United States; ObamaCare is destroying jobs--just at a time when we were coming out of the worst recession since the Great We saw uneven job growth in this country but undeniable job growth over the entire period of time they were saying ObamaCare was destroying the country and destroying our economy.  The recession was at the end of the last administration. The Obama administration saw the largest job increases we have seen in this country since World War I know it is inconvenient to believe that or to say that. I know that in corners of the internet where false news really does dominate, people don't believe it, but it is true. I am the first to say there are not enough good jobs, and I am the first to say there are not enough high-paying jobs, but compared to the record we inherited, it was a success, all while we had the Affordable Care Act being implemented, all while we were extending coverage to millions of people in America--many of them children who didn't have adequate coverage before we passed the Affordable Care  It has been called every name in the book, just like President Obama was called every name in the book, and they linked those two things--healthcare reform, the Affordable Care Act, and That became its name.  Every single attack under the sun was levied on that. Why? Because people really believed it was destroying the healthcare system? Maybe some people did. Because they believed that it was destroying businesses? Maybe some people did. I suspect there was a much more simple reason, and that was to try to win elections.  By the way, while we are on the subject, no matter whether you support the Affordable Care Act--and I support some things about it; there are other parts of it that have been disappointing to me--I think it is fundamentally important for people to understand that the Affordable Care Act is not our healthcare system. It is part of our healthcare system. The regulations that it has placed on insurance providers so that people with preexisting conditions couldn't be denied insurance is part of our system. The fact that it tried to create accountable care organizations so people got better primary care so we would reduce the amount of hospital readmissions from something like 18 percent or 19 percent, which wasted billions of dollars in this country, down to 2 percent or 3 percent, that is healthcare.  But there is a lot of healthcare that has nothing to do with ObamaCare or that has something to do with it but it was not the creation of There is Medicare and There are doctors. There are nurses. There are patients. There are drug companies. That is our healthcare system, and our healthcare system is a mess. It is a mess. It is a mess. We tried to take this thing and improve it when we passed the Affordable Care Some of it worked; some of it didn't work. Some people would argue we went too far. Some people would say we didn't go enough.  But I can state this. I have been doing those town halls again in Colorado, and what I know is that people feel defeated not by ObamaCare but by the American healthcare system--by our healthcare system, which is less predictable and less affordable than in many countries around the world.[[Page S3777]]  Now President Trump knew this. He is a smart politician. I never thought he was going to win. I never thought he was going to win on a campaign that on so many dimensions was out of step with conventional American political thought, and I was wrong. He won. I don't think he represents a traditional Republican view, and that may be one reason he won. In no sense do I think of Donald Trump as a conservative. I think of him as quite radical in his proposals. I think of him as a reactionary force on a political system that the American people, for whatever reason--some of them are probably good reasons--were losing their patience with.  You cannot deny that the guy, somehow, in the far reaches of Trump Tower, had his finger on the pulse of what was going on in some parts of this country. I don't know if it was because he was a reality TV star or what it was, but one of those things was healthcare. He understood the American people's dissatisfaction with our healthcare system, just as these 7 years and 8 years of Republican campaigns have understood it. Majority Leader McConnell made it clear when we were passing the bill: You own it. You own it. He said in a book later that it was very important to him that the American people were able to demarcate between the Democrats' responsibility for the healthcare system as it was and the Republicans' willingness to take no responsibility for it.  Even though we had hundreds of hours of hearings that lasted more than a year and even though we had--they are not countless--well over 100 Republican amendments that were made in committee and on the floor that were incorporated in the legislation, in the end, not a single Republican voted for the bill.  Maybe that was a principled reason, not just a political reason, because maybe there are some people who have the view in the Republican Party that the Federal Government should not have any increased involvement in their healthcare system. In fact, I have heard some people say the Federal Government should play no role in the healthcare system. Yet whatever the reason, not a single Republican voted for  The rest of the history writes itself, which is that every premium increase in America, whether it was related to ObamaCare or not, becomes part of Every drug that gets increased in price becomes ObamaCare, and for everybody who loses his insurance, that is ObamaCare when what is happening is really far more complex than that.  There are very legitimate critiques of ObamaCare, but it is not the same thing as our entire healthcare system. I think it is important to make that point because, whether we are considering the Republicans' proposed bill tonight or someone else's proposed bill tonight, we would have to understand it was not going to fix the whole problem all at once.  People in my State are deeply dissatisfied with our healthcare system. I say that as somebody who voted for the Affordable Care I have said it before. People have tried to make a political issue out of it. They write ads about it: Look, Bennet said the healthcare system is not perfect.  I will go further than that. It is a crying shame that people in this country have to spend their lives wrestling with insurance companies, lying awake, wondering whether their kids are going to be able to get primary care or dental care or cancer care if they get sick. That keeps families up every night in my State, not so much the people who are on Medicare but a lot of other people.  So Candidate Trump saw this unease in the American people, this concern that the American people had with our healthcare system, which I share, and in his campaign--in his very populist campaign for President--he promised to provide ``such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost.'' Those knuckleheads in Washington do not know what they are doing. I am going to deliver you ``such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost.'' That was his promise to the American people. That is what he said he was going to deliver.  He differentiated himself from other Republicans by saying: ``I will never cut Medicare.'' ``I will never cut Medicaid.'' He said: Those other Republicans say they will. I am not going to do that, but I am going to supply better healthcare than you are getting now at a tiny fraction of the cost. He said: ``Everybody is going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now'' with no cuts to Medicare and no cuts to  We had our election, and people voted for this nominee who made not just these promises but many other promises about what he was going to do for our economy based on, I think, largely, a complete fiction about what is actually going on in our country--for that matter, in the world--with respect to our economy. So he won. He did not just win--the Senate is Republican, and the House of Representatives is  Now, after running elections for 8 years to get rid of that scourge on America, that stain on America, that legislation that has destroyed our economy and destroyed our healthcare system, they wrote a bill. It took them a long time, really, to get it through the House of Representatives, which was shocking, because they had 8 years to figure out what was wrong with the current system and how to address the current system. They tried it once, and they could not even bring it to a vote in the They could not even bring it to a vote.  Then, understandably, the people who sent those Republicans to office in the House said: What are you talking about? You said you were going to repeal You told us all of these terrible things that ObamaCare had done. Your first order of business was to repeal How dare you not have a vote?  I am glad they said that because people should keep their promises.  I have believed for a long time that people want consistency out of their politicians, that they will put up with inconsistency if you say to them that the facts are different than I thought they were and that is why I changed my view. Yet, in these times of fake news, of the media having the challenges it has, and the rest of the things that ail our system, consistency is not something that a lot of politicians pay attention to. I think they think that is because voters do not pay attention to it, but, in this case, they did. They said: You said you would repeal You did not just say it once. You said it year, after year, after year, after year. Finally, they then passed a bill in the Not a single Democrat voted for it.  We learned from that process, which took place before the Congressional Budget Office had even scored the bill--imagine that. There were all of these people who criticized the Affordable Care Act, and proponents were rushing the bill through. As I said, I think there were 200 Republican amendments adopted. It was a bill that held almost countless committee hearings in the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate HELP It was a bill that consumed 25 days of legislative process on this floor, a modern record in terms of time. In fact, we had all of that process, and I will come back to this.  Here is what Senator McConnell said about that. After all of that process, he said on this floor, I think, that Americans were ``tired of giant bills negotiated in secret and then rammed through on a party-line vote in the middle of the night.'' Oh, that bill was negotiated completely in public, painfully in public. I used to go home, and people in my townhalls literally had copies of the bill. Do you remember the chant: ``Read the bill. Read the bill''? That is because everybody had the bill.  On the House side, it is important for people to understand that they passed the bill without even getting a score from what is called the Congressional Budget The head of the Congressional Budget Office is appointed by Republicans when the Republicans are in the majority, not by the It did not even get a score. We had a score on the Affordable Care Act before we passed the bill. We had a score that every single American could see about what it would cost and what money it would spend, what money it would save, how many people would be added to the insurance rolls. We had that. They did not have the decency to do that in the  They should have because--guess what happened--when the score came out, it said that 24 million people would lose their health insurance after[[Page S3778]]a candidate for President said that you are going to have ``such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost.'' ``Everybody is going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now,'' unless you are one of those 24 million and, I would argue, many of the rest as well. I will come to that.  So they passed that bill, a terrible bill. I think that bill has the lowest approval rating among the American people of any piece of legislation that has existed in the time I have been in the It is still not as low as the approval rating of this place, which used to be 9 percent, but it is low because people know it does not really address their healthcare problems. It is not a healthcare bill.  Then the President found out what was in the Congressional Budget Office's score, and he had some Republican Senators over to the White House and said: I hope you will not pass a bill like that. That is a mean bill.  That is not my description. That is President Trump's description of the House bill. That is a mean bill.  He said: I want a bill with a little more love in it than that bill out of the  He has to be disappointed tonight because the Congressional Budget Office's score came back and said that under the Senate's version of the bill--the less mean bill--only 22 million people will lose their health insurance and that far from having better insurance at a lower price, half of the country--literally half the country--is going to pay thousands more in out-of-pocket expenses because of what has become known as  There are three principal parts to the bill in the Senate and in the bill that has passed the There are some differences, but I would say they are differences without a distinction. They are immaterial distinctions. There are three major components to these so-called healthcare bills.  The first is a massive tax cut for the wealthiest people in If you are making $200,000 or less in Colorado or in any State in the country, you will not get a penny from this tax cut--not a penny. As my colleague from Pennsylvania said, if you are one of the top 400 taxpayers in America, together, you are going to get $33 billion in tax cuts. That is an average tax cut for each of those 400 Americans of $82.5 million. There is not a person in Colorado at any one of my townhalls who has said to me: Michael, the key to doing a better job with our healthcare and the key to fixing ObamaCare--and I am talking about the critics of There is not a one who has said to repeal those taxes on the top 1 percent of taxpayers in America at a time when our income inequality has not been greater than in 1928 and at a time when we are collecting in revenue only 18 percent of our gross domestic product and spending 21 percent. Not a single person has stood up in a townhall meeting and said the key to success here is in cutting those taxes. Just to be clear, I should mention that $82.5 million is over a 10-year period. It is about $8.25 million a year.  As Senator Casey, from Pennsylvania, noted, that $33 billion adds up to be the equivalent of what it would cost to pay for the Medicaid of 772,000 people who live in just four States--the entire Medicaid population of four  But what they would consume in healthcare to try to support themselves and their family is not $8.5 million a year; it is not $85 million over 10 years; it is, on average, $4,500 a year on healthcare. That is the first part of this bill--a massive tax cut that is not going to benefit anybody in my State who earns below $200,000.  The second element of this bill is a massive cut to Medicaid, which is one of the fundamental safety net programs in this country. The cut, whether you look at the House cut or the Senate cut, is massive. It is about a quarter of the program. It is about $840 billion. And in the Senate bill, the cuts are even deeper than they were in the House bill. I wonder what the President would say about that. The House bill was mean. I bet he would say the Senate bill is cruel because it perpetuates those cuts.  I have heard the rhetoric from politicians in Washington about why it is so important to cut They need to cut Medicaid so they can pay for the tax cuts for people who are so wealthy, most of them probably don't even need to mess around with insurance to pay for their healthcare or their doctors. Now they are going to have another $8.5 billion a year. Now they are going to have another $85 million over 10 years if they want to spend it not on insurance but on whatever else they want to spend it.  So on the one hand, they had to find the money to pay for this tax cut. They found it from some of the poorest Americans there are. How do they justify that? They justify it by painting a picture that says that there are Medicaid recipients all over America who are receiving Medicaid but not working, and therefore we should cut the program because if we cut the program, they will know they have to get a job in order to buy health insurance, and they won't be on the Federal Medicaid They say to go to work, and that is why we can cut this program. Keep people out of that hammock they are lying in instead of working for their healthcare.  What an insult to the almost 50 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries in Colorado who are poor children. Are they supposed to go to work, or can they go to school? And while we are at it, maybe we should think about giving them better schools so they can actually compete in this economy. But are we really going to take away their healthcare?  Then there are a whole bunch of people who have spent down their life savings for the privilege of being in a nursing home paid for by There is not a townhall I have where there aren't sons and daughters or grandsons and granddaughters of people who are in nursing homes paid for by Medicaid after they had to spend their whole life savings down to be there. What a terrible system it is that a family has to be near bankruptcy before we say: We will give you a helping hand. It is a terrible system, but it is what they have. And they can't work. They are in a nursing home. They are in long-term care.  Then there are a whole bunch of people in my State and in other States--and this may be the greatest insult of all--who are working at one job or sometimes at two jobs, and in the richest country in the world, they are working and are getting paid and are not getting paid enough to be off the Medicaid rolls. They are working, and they are still on public assistance. And we are cutting a quarter of the Medicaid Program because people need to go to work.  I am not making this stuff up. I asked Secretary Price, who is the Secretary of HHS, Health and Human Services--he is in charge of the healthcare for this administration--I said: Mr.Secretary, let me take you through the faces of the people in my State who are on And not only did they confirm that that is who is on Medicaid in my State, he said that is the way it looks all over the country.  What an insult to justify a massive tax cut for the richest Americans by taking away poor people's healthcare; by saying they are not working for it, when they are children, when they are in nursing homes, when they are working one and sometimes two jobs in the richest country on the world.  So that is the second part of this healthcare plan--tax cuts for wealthy people and cutting Medicaid for poor people. And in the middle of that is the only thing that could fairly be described as a healthcare plan; it is just a terrible plan.  Senator Paul from Kentucky--one of the more principled people in this Chamber--said it very well when he called it, not politely, ``ObamaCare lite.'' He is absolutely right. If you hate ObamaCare, you are really going to hate ObamaCare lite. It is the same structure, which amazes me because all of the people who said we should repeal ObamaCare are now preserving the very basic structure of how the program worked, but the problem with it is that they have cut the subsidies. They have turned them into tax credits and cut the value of the subsidies. If you think insurance is expensive now in the individual market, wait until you meet ObamaCare lite, in the words of Rand  So those are the three components of the bill. And it is not surprising to me that for those reasons, Senator McConnell has written this bill in secret. It[[Page S3779]]is not surprising to me that he hasn't wanted to have a committee hearing. It is not surprising to me that he brought the bill here on the floor last Thursday, then accused people on the other side of not having read the bill and still wants us to act on the bill this Thursday so he can go home before July 4th and say to the American people: We did it. We kept our promise. We repealed We may have written a terrible piece of legislation that has nothing to do with improving your healthcare, but we repealed And he is hoping the American people won't notice.  Let me tell you something. The American people are noticing. There is a reason why the House bill has the worst approval rating of any piece of legislation in modern American history. The American people are not stupid.  I was in Frisco, CO, not that long ago, which is a place that everybody should visit from all over the country. There is tremendous skiing, and there is tremendous hiking, wonderful people. And before I had the townhall meeting, I went and visited a healthcare center there that they are justifiably proud of. It turns no one away. It gives phenomenal primary care. It gives phenomenal dental care. They have to figure out every week how to get through, but they always figure out how to get through so that people in Frisco and in the surrounding area have healthcare.  This is not a poor community by American standards. It is a resort community, but there are people who live there year-round. I asked the people who run the clinic: Who are the payers for healthcare in your clinic? Who are they? What pays for healthcare here? And she said: Well, Michael, the Medicaid is 33 percent. That shocked me because if you are in rural Colorado, the Medicaid number is usually a lot higher than that because people don't have access to a lot of resources, and we all know they don't have access to a robust insurance market. Thirty-three percent was Medicaid, 53 percent was uncompensated care, and the rest was private insurance companies that pay for the insurance. That shocked me.  I said: Fifty-three percent is uncompensated care, people with no insurance? How can that be?  She said: These are people in our community who make too much money to be eligible for Medicaid, but they can't afford private insurance.  They are working full time; that is not the problem. They are not even--as I described before in a case where somebody is paying them too little, so they are eligible for Medicaid; their problem is that they are being paid too much, and they are not eligible for Medicaid as a result, but they can't afford private insurance. I think that is an indictment of the Affordable Care Act that I accept as somebody who voted for it. The idea that we would require people in America to buy health insurance and then not have a market that gave them quality health insurance at an affordable price is ridiculous.  I have had people in rural Colorado say to me: Michael, look, why are you requiring me to buy something where there is not enough competition, so the premium is high and the deductible is ridiculous. So it is of no use to my family, and you are requiring me to buy something that is useless to me. We should have more competition to drive down price.  I say: You are 100 percent correct.  And if we had a functioning Congress that wanted to take a bipartisan approach to fixing that problem, we could fix it, and there are probably 15 or 20 other things along those lines. But the Republican healthcare bill--so-called healthcare bill--does none of that. It does none of that.  So to the extent that you don't like ObamaCare because you feel as though your premiums are going up and you are not getting enough for it, as opposed to the millions of people who have gotten insurance as a result of it, some for the first time--to the extent you are worried about that, the House bill makes it worse and the Senate bill makes it worse.  There is a projection in the CBO report that says that at a certain point in time, your premiums might come down under the Republican bill, but the reason for that is because you will be buying lousy insurance. It is not because Donald Trump, as he said to the country, has provided such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost. That is not the reason. It is because they provided terrible healthcare at a fraction of the cost. That is not a benefit to anybody. If an insurance company can put you on lifetime caps, of course they are going to charge you less.  I am all for working together in a bipartisan way to address the issues in our healthcare system that, frankly, go far beyond the Affordable Care Act to make sure people in America don't have to continue to make the choices people all over the world don't have to make about having to stay in a job they hate because they have to keep the insurance or being able to quit a job and do something else because they know the insurance will be there. Nobody else has to make those decisions. And nobody else in the world goes bankrupt because of healthcare, but that is still a problem in  I think fundamentally the problem we have here tonight is proponents of this legislation didn't set out to fix our healthcare system; they set out to repeal ObamaCare or the cartoon of ObamaCare they have been running on for the last 8 years. That is what they set out to do. Along the way, they obscured it all so they could have the opportunity to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans--which, for some reason, is an obsession with some people around here--and dramatically cut access to healthcare by poor children.  I know there are people who are hearing this will not believe what I am saying is true. It is true. I hope you will familiarize yourself with the facts. I hope, in particular, people who feel the last bill we considered on this floor didn't get the process it deserved--people who quite rightly wanted to make sure Members of the Senate and the House had actually read the bill, people who wanted to know what it was like to live in a country where your health insurance is uncertain from month to month, where you have to decide between paying the rent, buying the food or being on health insurance; people who are dealing with and whose families are dealing with the effects of this terrible opioid crisis that wasn't even really a gleam in our eye when we passed the Affordable Care  I especially say to people living in rural America how sorry I am that people aren't paying attention to your needs; that your hospitals may be cut because of an ill-considered piece of legislation which has nothing to do with delivering healthcare in rural Colorado or rural  We can do so much better than this, but to get to a place, unfortunately, where Democrats and Republicans have the opportunity to work together, the first order of business has to be to defeat the bill on the floor. I hope people know this is the week when it is critical to call and let your voices be heard, let people know you expect something better than what we are getting, and that Americans ought to have a healthcare system that is affordable, that is predictable, and that actually creates stability instead of instability for their families.

11552,topic-id,961,"Mr.Speaker, how do I even start after getting an introduction like that other than to say that I am so blessed to be part of what I will put up against any Congress as the finest freshman class that has come across this floor to be sworn in. I am just proud to be one of Mr.Arrington's colleagues.  Mr.Speaker, when you talk about rural America, how do you know it if you have never been part of it? I was born, raised, and grew up in a little Minnesota farming town. My dad came from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan because there was no work there for 18-year-olds. He went to Minneapolis looking for work. Of course, he found it, and then he found my mom. You know how that goes. So she told him that is where he was going to live for a while, and so that is where I was born.  I had to walk all of a half a mile to work on a farm to help. It was about a 200-head dairy farm that also had some corn and some soybeans, and they had hay. I learned how to bale hay, I learned how to not fall off the wagon, and I learned how to shoot the silage into the silo and not fall into the silo when you are doing it.  One of the least favorite jobs was cleaning up the dairy barn because it had those unique aromas. On a hot August day, you learn that they are all unique, but they are all important to the betterment of what we are trying to accomplish here.  When you work with your hands--I have seen firsthand how rural America works, the dedication, the hard work, and the life that on a daily basis begins before the sun rises and, in many cases, ends long after the sun sets--that is commitment. It is not only commitment to your family, it is commitment to yourself, and it is commitment to your God that you know that you are blessed with what we have in our land.  It is such important work. Daniel Webster said:  ``Let us not forget that the cultivation of the earth is the most important labor of man.''  ``The farmers, therefore, are the founders of civilization.''  It is so easy to believe that when the lights go off at the grocery store at night that the food just magically appears on the shelves. It is amazing how that just happens. Well, we know it doesn't just happen. It is the last in a series of long steps. Rural America knows better than anyone what it takes to get the food on those shelves. Rural America feeds the world, produces resources that are used in other industries, acts as job creators and the foundation of the economy, provides food security, and contributes to the moral fabric of our society.  Farmers face so many challenges already. They are at the mercy of the weather, crop volatility, and ever-changing prices. Why is the government so insistent on adding more rocks to the pack of the farmer who is already overburdened in so many ways? They don't need any more headaches.  I have often said that if something works in Michigan's First District, it will work anywhere. We are largely rural. We have got a lot of big water shoreline, and part of that big water shoreline provides the water to cultivate our fields. We grow a lot of potatoes up there. Anybody who really loves potato chips, chances are they came from a potato that started in We grow sugar beets, cherries, and apples, just to name a few. In fact, just this past weekend, back in the district, I had a chance to really taste the cherries that we picked off[[Page H6282]]the tree because it is that time of the year.  We should be looking forward and looking to rural America as the example for success, not trying to hold it back with bureaucratic regulations and out-of-control government spending. It is time to cut through the red tape. Rural and urban survival depend on it. Power belongs in the hands of the individual--the farmers, the loggers, the fishermen, the miners, the ranchers, and every other hardworking man and woman in so many districts around the country and especially in our First District of  Mr.Speaker, speaking of hands, people who work with the land know when you are working with your hands that you don't just go right to the harvest. You first must till the land. You have to plant. You have to manage the growing season. Only then, after that long process that you cannot shortcut in any way, then comes a successful harvest. It has to happen in order. There is no other way. So anyone who expects good things happen easily has never been a farmer and has never been working with their hands.  It is our job not just to honor but to raise rural Americans up as an example that hard work and traditional American values are still something to be admired so deeply.  Mr.Speaker, it is an honor just to be talking about this subject tonight. It actually makes me want to somehow figure out a way to get back to the district right away to finish up the cherry harvest. It looks like we are going to have a really good one this year because God has blessed us with good weather.  Rural America is who we are, and it is who we fight for. I am proud to be a Member of the 115th  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Arrington) for the opportunity to speak on something that is so passionate and dear to my heart.

We do it good natured, but, frankly, it is beside the point. And my friends from the Ways and Means Committee have documented the fact that this is a solution in search of a problem.  The real outrage ought to be what is happening now behind closed doors to take a flawed bill that came from the House, was actually made worse in order to get the votes for it, and passed through on a narrow party-line vote--actually, a number of Republicans voted against it--lodged in the Senate, no public hearings. In fact, we are told that they are not enabling people to actually get ahold of the documents to know what is going on.  You know, it is stunning to me to have heard some of my Republican friends complain about the process of the Affordable Care I was in the middle of that. We took a year. Three committees in the House had multiple hearings, work sessions. There were actually some Republican amendments adopted out in the open. CBO scored the bill so people knew. Now we are on the verge of, we are told, having that sneak through the Senate without the glare of publicity, without an open public process, which will deny healthcare to millions of people--millions of people--and shred much of the good work that has been done through the Affordable Care                              {time}  1415  We have been told and we acknowledge there are little things that we could do to fine-tune it, but in 7 years of Republican crow and crow, we have never had an opportunity to do that.

And you don't have to take my word for it. News accounts quote people in the industry about what the Republicans have done to destabilize it and try to make it fail.  There was a reason that virtually everybody in the healthcare space was opposed to the Republican approach. It is not thoughtful. It is not fair. It is not effective. It is not necessary.

There are tremendous opportunities for us to work together on a bipartisan agenda that we have in the Ways and Means Committee, of things that we could move forward and agree upon to make healthcare better, that doesn't depend on shredding the guarantees of the ACA; that doesn't depend on gutting Medicaid, which more Americans rely upon for their healthcare than any other program in the country. We wouldn't have to mess with that.  Instead, we are having a sideshow. I don't know that it goes anywhere, but it certainly isn't the issue that Americans could focus on, should focus on, that is going to imperil their healthcare for tens of millions of Americans if the Republicans have their way.

11657,topic-id,520,"Mr.President, the Senate has under consideration the nomination of Rachel Brand to be Associate Attorney General of the United States, one of the very top positions in the Department of Justice and in law enforcement. It is a position of consummate trust and responsibility, requiring full public confidence. I will oppose this nomination, and I will oppose all nominations for the Department of Justice until public trust and confidence in the rule of law is restored and sustained by appointment of an independent special prosecutor to investigate Russian interference in our last election and potential links to the Trump campaign and Trump associates.  I opposed Rod Rosenstein's nomination. In fact, I was the only member of the Judiciary Committee to vote against it and one of six on the floor to oppose it for exactly the same reason. I stated to him publicly and privately that the only way to preserve his own reputation--well established over many years--and the trust and confidence in the Department of Justice was to appoint an independent prosecutor. So far, regrettably, he has failed to do so.  That question will be the first of my priorities when the full Senate meets with him tomorrow. We will demand to[[Page S2985]]know from him what the timeline was for the firing of Director Comey, who said what to whom, why his memorandum was written, and whether he will now commit, after these most recent startling revelations just yesterday that the President of the United States suggested--indeed, explicitly demanded--that Director Comey stop his investigation involving potential ties of Michael Flynn to Russian interference in our election.  Chilling facts raised in the last several days now raise serious questions about obstruction of justice by the President of the United So we consider this nomination at a truly unusual, very likely unique and unprecedented time in our country.  The revelation last evening that President Trump asked the FBI Director to shut down the Federal investigation into his then-National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, is evidence of severe political interference and possibly criminal wrongdoing in an ongoing criminal investigation. The evidence of obstruction continues to mount. We are witnessing an obstruction of justice case unfolding before our eyes in real time. Revelation after revelation continues to shake this country's confidence in our government and in this administration's competence. The need for an independent special prosecutor has never been so clear and convincing and so unquestionably necessary.  I call on my Republican colleagues now to rise to this challenge, to shine in the light of history, and to commit that an independent special prosecutor will be appointed to uncover the truth and hold accountable anyone who has committed wrongdoing.  Because so far we have no such special prosecutor, I will oppose this nomination. But I also have disagreements with Rachel I respect her record of public service. I believe she is simply not the right person to serve as Associate Attorney General because of her longstanding, apparently deeply held philosophy on the use and proper application of government power.

11673,topic-id,439,"Mr.President, I begin by thanking my colleague and friend Senator Schatz for his extraordinary leadership in this area that has brought us to the floor. I am proud to speak against the Federal Communications Commission Chairman's proposed order that is in fact slated for a vote at the open commission meeting tomorrow morning. That vote would undo the open internet order.  What is at stake here is, really, First Amendment rights to free speech. Those rights are threatened. Net neutrality has never been more important. Allowing broadband providers to block or discriminate against certain content providers is a danger to free speech and the freedom of our press. These principles are fundamental to our democracy. We should safeguard them by stopping this proposed repeal of the open internet order.  The internet's astonishing economic success is due to its being open and the access that it provides as an open platform. Anyone with a good idea can connect with consumers. Anyone who wants to reach across the globe to talk to others or to pitch and promote ideas and products encounters a level playing field, and that ought to be the reality.  On February 25, 2015, the FCC adopted the open internet order to preserve that open nature of the internet. The order, essentially, embodies three rules--no blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization. Those principles are now at risk. In fact, they are in grave jeopardy. Those principles guarantee people, within the bounds of the law, access to different web content regardless of the political views expressed and regardless of the wealth of a site. They assure that the internet is open--that it is not a walled garden for wealthy companies. A lot is at stake here, and consumers and others should prevail because their interests are, ultimately, what is involved.  Ultimately, the Administrative Procedure Act requires, in my view, that Chairman Pai prove, through a fact-based docket, that something has significantly changed in the market since the open internet rule was established in February of 2015. Without that change in facts, the decimation of this rule cannot be justified. We cannot allow Chairman Pai to succeed in this plan to gut neutrality at the behest of moneyed internet service providers. Chairman Pai's proposal, if it succeeds tomorrow, will deprive the American people, startups, and businesses of important bright-line net neutrality rules.

11843,topic-id,1959,"Mr.President, I am proud to be on the floor today, proud to stand with my colleagues, and I hope that at the end of this week, I will be proud of all of my colleagues when we vote to defeat this measure, or at least to delay it, because we owe the American people the right to be heard.  Our responsibility as elected representatives is at the very least to listen. I have been listening over the last week but really over the last year to constituents of mine in the State of Connecticut and over the last week at two emergency field hearings that I conducted because no hearings were held by the Senate and no markups and no votes in committee. What we saw here in Washington was complete secrecy, a bill produced behind closed doors, only seeing the light of day for the first time last  Our Republican colleagues have gone from total secrecy to total chaos. The reason for the chaos is the facts that were most dramatically revealed today--just hours ago--when the Congressional Budget Office told us, not surprisingly, that 22 million Americans would be thrown to the wolves as a result of this measure--thrown to the wolves of no healthcare coverage--and eventually 49 million Americans would be without healthcare insurance by 2026.  Next year alone, 15 million more people will be uninsured under the Republican plan, TrumpCare 2.0. Low-income Americans would be unable to afford any plan at all, and anybody who does would be paying higher costs for fewer services of lesser quality. Americans will pay a higher share of their income and receive less as a result. A 64-year-old making almost $57,000 will go from paying $6,800 under the Affordable Care Act to $20,500 under the proposal before this body. This jump in cost is absolutely staggering.  It will destroy the financial well-being of middle-class Americans who also, when they need nursing home care, after they have exhausted their savings, will be thrown to the wolves. I visited one such facility just last Friday, where two-thirds of its 60 beds will be unaffordable when those middle-class families find their savings will no longer cover it.  These facts are the reason for the Republican chaos. One of our former colleagues, my mentor, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, famously said: ``Everybody is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.'' The administration's statement that the CBO is not to be blindly trusted--nobody has to trust the CBO blindly. Those facts are driven by reality. Their report speaks truth to power and to the American people, and the American people get it.  None of us can look our constituents in the eye, look ourselves in the mirror, look inside ourselves, in our hearts, and justify a vote for this bill. The American people are angry, many of them because we are even considering it. It is not an anger that is kind of a shrug of the shoulders; it is a deep, vocal, vehement, vitriolic anger. I have seen it and heard it at those hearings, where I listened to people coming forward and talking about this bill, recognizing it for what it is. It is not a healthcare bill; it is a massive tax cut for the wealthy.  Just Friday afternoon, one of the folks who attended the hearing came to the microphone and said: Don't call it a healthcare bill; it is a wealth care bill. In fact, she is absolutely right. This bill cuts hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes for the richest so that they will do better, but it also cuts $800 billion in Medicaid spending and investment to provide for that kind of tax cut. It is not a healthcare bill; it is a wealth care bill. And for most Americans, it is a catastrophic, cruel, and costly insult to their intelligence, their health, and our American values. It is a sham and a charade, making possible those cuts for the rich--tax cuts for them--at the expense of our most vulnerable citizens. And it has been the result of a profoundly undemocratic process--secrecy and speed.  Despite the best efforts of our Republican colleagues to keep Americans in the dark about what this proposal would do, I have seen growing awareness, again, not only at these hearings but as I walk through the airport, as I march in parades--twice over this weekend--as I attend public gatherings. Whether it is Boys State, sponsored by the American Legion for 16- and 17-year-olds, or nursing facilities for elderly citizens, there is a growing awareness that this bill is bad--profoundly bad--for the American people.  The people I have heard from have prescriptions to fill, appointments to make, lives to live, but they have come to these hearings on very short notice in Hartford and in New Haven, literally filling rooms so that there was standing room only.  I challenge my colleagues to hold the same kinds of hearings, to delay this vote so that they can go home at the end of this week and hold hearings in their State and listen to their constituents about what they have to say and what the consequences will be.  Nearly 1 in 10 veterans has Medicaid coverage, meaning that a staggering 1.75 million veterans, including 18,000 veterans in Connecticut, would be impacted by these reckless cuts. Let me repeat that number for all of us who rejoiced in the recent Accountability and Whistleblowers Some 1.75 million veterans--18,000 of them in Connecticut--will be harmed by this reckless and needless insult and injury.  Put simply, this bill would make it hard for veterans with mental health disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder to get care. Nearly a quarter of all veterans receive care for mental health disorders outside the VA system, meaning they rely on protections that guarantee their access to affordable care. Under this proposal, those protections would be severely threatened, and the veterans who need that care would see that care at risk.  Here we are talking about a choice program that enables veterans to seek care outside the VA system, privately, and we are endangering care for millions of Americans--veterans--who need and seek it by using  If my colleagues listen to their constituents, they will hear from many of the people who have come to my townhalls, like Christine Christine has two beautiful 4-year-old twins named McKenzie and McKenzie was born with Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that her mom described as ``including low muscle tone, seizures, temperature instability, sleep apnea, infertility, OCD, intellectual disabilities, and developmental delay.''  In the first few weeks of her life, McKenzie was in the hospital for 57 days, accounting for $2 million in costs. Their family was spending $30,000 a year to help their daughter thrive. So when Christine learned that her daughter had received a waiver to become a Medicaid beneficiary, she was overjoyed.  Christine told me:       When we received McKenzie's diagnosis, we were told that      she wouldn't do a lot of things, and at only 4 years old      she's already defying the odds. I have no doubt in my mind      that if we are able to continue down our current path of the      proper therapies and doctors, McKenzie will be able to have      her fruitful life. I am terrified if the rug comes out      beneath her that she will become just another statistic.  Another statistic? There are enough statistics in that CBO report. We will hear a plethora of statistics on the[[Page S3769]]floor, but a picture is worth a thousand words and many more than a thousand statistics, and no one--no one should be consigned to being a statistic.  This family is one of the many faces and pictures and stories of They deserve to be heard. If we gut this program, if we strip away the important services it provides, we know all too well what will happen to McKenzie and her family as statistics. Like her mother said, Medicaid has been the path to success for them, and that rug will be pulled from that family, from beneath  At the hearing on Friday in New Haven, I heard from Kent O'Brien, who told me about the eight prescription medications he takes--four for psychiatric reasons and four for medical reasons.  Of course, mental health parity has been one of the crusades of my life. When I was State attorney general, I worked with Senator Ted Kennedy and Congressman Patrick Kennedy to help advocate for that bill. As a Senator, I advocated for the regulations that were necessary for its enforcement, and we finally got it done.  I want to quote what Kent said directly. He told me:       Hi, everybody, how are you today? I'm going to keep this      brief, because I know the senators are on a very strict time      constraint and I respect that. So I'm just going to talk very      quickly about my prescription medications; there are eight of      them. Four of them are for psychiatric reasons and four are      medical. And if I lose my Medicare and Medicaid, I will be      unable to pay for them obviously, which in turn I will end up      in the hospital.  Kent went on:       Now, for the Republicans who are seeing this in Washington,      can you please listen to me carefully?  I am speaking to an empty Let nobody make any mistake that Republicans are hanging on Kent's words as I speak now, but every one of them should go to the Every one of them should be listening in their offices. Every one of them should go to the  Kent goes on:       If I lose that medication, I will end up in the hospital,      and it's going to cost the state and the federal government      much more money than it would be to simply let me go to the      pharmacy and pick up my medication.  If there were ever a message that Washington should hear, it is from Kent O'Brien, who closed by simply saying:       So I'm just going to close up with that, and don't hurt the      American people. Help them!  If you met Kent, you would wonder how he was capable of that eloquence. He is an ordinary American, someone who looks like all the rest of us. He has said to this body what it means to hear: ``Don't hurt the American people.'' He couldn't be more right. This proposal would cost our Nation so much, not just financially--Kent had it right--but morally. It will lead to a weakening of what makes our country strong and great in the first place: our ability to care about our neighbor, to fight for what is right, and to listen to the people who represent here in the  First, do no harm.

11864,topic-id,1954,"Mr.President, there is a saying, an old adage, that history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.  Over the past week, the dramatic firing of James Comey has recalled past events--history that involved one of the major scandals in our Nation's past--the Watergate scandal.  In Watergate, the saying originated--another very common saying--that the coverup is worse than the crime. The danger now in the United States--the greatest country in the history of the world, with the most effective and fair justice on our planet--is that, in fact, there may be a coverup, and that the truth will be stifled, and people who should be held accountable will not be. That is the danger.  In this instance, in comparison to Watergate, actually, the crime is extraordinarily serious. In Watergate, there was a two-bit break-in or burglary, and the coverup, in fact, involved obstruction of justice. What we have here is a deliberate, purposeful assault on our American democracy by the Russians through a cyber attack that involved, really, in effect, an act of war--a combination of cyber, propaganda, and misinformation spread deliberately; it involved hacking into both major parties and the spread of the results of that hacking for one of those parties--possibly influencing the outcome of the election.  The issue of whether and how the outcome of that election may have[[Page S2907]]been influenced will be discussed and contended through the annals of history. Regardless of your point of view on what the impact was, the fact is, the criminal action by the Russians interfering with our election must be investigated aggressively and impartially, and the Russians, and anyone who aided and abetted them, must be held accountable. That is what the American people want. They want the truth uncovered, and they want to hold accountable anyone who colluded with the Russians in this attack on our Nation, anyone who aided and abetted or assisted them, anyone who bears a responsibility and should be held criminally culpable.  The Watergate scandal was eventually successfully prosecuted. It took years to do so. The appointment of a special prosecutor was key to that effort. In fact, Elliott Richardson was not only requested, he was required to appoint a special prosecutor as a condition of his confirmation. He was specifically directed by the Judiciary Committee of the U.Senate, and he agreed to do so. Archibald Cox was appointed, and then President Nixon fired Elliott Richardson as well as his deputy, William Ruckelshaus, because they refused to dismiss Archibald  The principle here--the rhyming of history if not its repeating--is that sometimes investigations come so close to power and the truth about the power that there is an effort to stifle them.  Watergate involved a two-bit burglary. This crime involves the theft of our democracy by the Russians and by others who may have colluded with him. So a successful investigation here goes to the fundamental principle that our elections will be free and credible, that they will be honest, without foreign interference or meddling by anyone.  The firing of James Comey as FBI Director is reminiscent of what happened with the dismissal of two Attorneys General and then a special prosecutor because it raises the possibility that an investigation will be catastrophically compromised and undermined by the President of the United  Just last week, I asked James Comey whether the President of the United States might currently be a target of the criminal investigation. Director Comey would not and could not rule out that possibility because he cannot speak about targets freely and openly, but we know some of the individuals implicated are close associates of the Trump campaign, including Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Each had different roles; for example, Paul Manafort was a leader of the campaign.  We know that subpoenas have been issued from a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York for materials relating to Michael Flynn and to his associates. We know that then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates went to the White House and warned that he might be vulnerable to blackmail because he had lied to the Vice  We know also that very possibly he lied to the He deceptively omitted from materials or responses he gave in his security clearance information about payments to him from the Russians and the Turkish Government and that he may have committed other very serious violations of criminal law, punishable by years in prison. That investigation is ongoing now.  As I speak on the floor of the U.Senate, my hope is that agents of the FBI are doing their work, as they have done for decades, with integrity and determination and dedication. I know the work the FBI does, having worked with them as the U.Attorney in It is not only one of our premier law enforcement agencies, there is none finer in the world. I have confidence that they will continue this investigation successfully, meaning that they will achieve a just result, if there is the right leadership.  That is why I believe now there is no question that an independent special prosecutor must be appointed. There is no longer any doubt that an independent special prosecutor is necessary for the appearance and credibility, the appearance of integrity, and the credibility and objectivity of this investigation.  The different contradictory stories surrounding the firing of James Comey emphasizes this point. Initially, the decision was made by Rod Rosenstein as Deputy Attorney General, but of course it involved also the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who never should have been involved because he was recused from the investigation. The reason given by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein involved the Hillary Clinton emails and statements made by Jim Comey 10 months ago--an explanation that defied belief, a pretense that was laughable and especially unfortunate--even tragic--from a career professional prosecutor like Rod  Well, that explanation now has been supplanted; in fact, as recently as this morning, in an interview the President gave to Lester Holt of NBC, acknowledging that he made the decision because he had lost faith in Jim Never mind that he reaffirmed that faith shortly after his inaugural. Never mind that he praised Jim Comey on the campaign trail. His reasons for dismissing Jim Comey also defy belief.  This set of incidents shakes to the core the trust all of us should have in our justice system, in the integrity of our public officials, in the capability of that system to uncover the truth and hold accountable anyone who has violated the law.  President Trump has now fired not one but two high-ranking Justice officials after they told him about suspicions that he or his associates have broken the law; first, Sally Yates and now Director  Attorney General Sessions has shown through his role in the Comey firing that even after he has recused himself from an investigation, he will help the President punish Justice Department officials who are pushing that investigation forward.  Maybe most disappointing, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein--the man now responsible for the Trump-Russia investigation--has permitted himself to become a pawn in President Trump's game. His credibility and integrity may well have been irredeemably sacrificed. The only way for him to restore it now is to appoint a special prosecutor. That power is his alone. The rules and regulations of the Department of Justice not only permit it, in my view, the standards of ethics require it because he now is irrevocably conflicted.  President Trump, Attorney General Sessions, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein want Americans to believe Comey was fired because he publicly discussed his investigation into Hillary That kind of statement betrays contempt for the intelligence of the American people because we remember President Trump applauding Director Comey's decision to discuss the Clinton investigation. He even used his letter firing Director Comey to publicly discuss the details of an FBI investigation, saying he has been told three times that he is not under investigation--albeit details I find very hard to believe.  He has called this investigation a charade. He has called the allegations of Russia meddling and Trump associates' collusion with it a hoax. He has belittled and demeaned not only the judges of our Federal bench, but, by implication, the hard-working men and women of the FBI who are doing an investigation which he says is ``a taxpayer-funded charade.'' That statement is a disservice to the FBI--a nonpolitical, nonpartisan law enforcement agency without superior in the world. They deserve and need a special prosecutor who can lead them in this moment of crisis.  Make no mistake, we face a looming constitutional crisis. The case of United States v. Nixon, which involved enforcement of subpoenas against the President, is no longer a matter of idle speculation; it is a real possibility.  What the FBI also needs now are resources to make sure this investigation is conducted fairly, impartially, objectively, and independently, with sufficient agents, staff, and other support. In fact, in my view, one of the precipitating factors in the firing of James Comey was his going to the Deputy Attorney General and asking for more resources. As a prosecutor, I know resources are the lifeblood of a successful investigation. An investigation deprived of resources cannot reach a just result; it will be strangled, stifled, and stopped. And that is clearly the purpose of some in this administration, perhaps because it is coming close to people whom they want to protect.[[Page S2908]]  Congress can and must use every tool at our disposal to make sure the investigation of the Trump administration's and campaign's ties to Russia and the potential ongoing coverup of those ties is affirmed. The true and independent special prosecutor is the only one who can assure. Our Intelligence Committees can produce findings and recommendations. An independent commission, which I support, can hold hearings in public and also produce a report. But only a special prosecutor can bring criminal charges and hold accountable anyone and everyone who should bear a price.  On both sides of the aisle, we have said the Russians must pay a price or they will do again in 2018 what they did in 2016, but so should the people who aided and abetted and colluded with them. If they fail to pay a price, they will do it again, too, corrupting our system, undermining the rule of law, and imperiling our democracy.  If the President continues to object to an independent investigation or special prosecutor, people of good will on both sides of the aisle must stand up to him and demand one. I am encouraged by some of what my Republican colleagues have told me over the last 24 hours.  I believe we are at a rhyming moment when the integrity of our justice system and our democracy is at stake. People, regardless of their political affiliation, owe it to our democracy to come forward, to recognize the gravity of this moment, and to stand up and speak out. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will do so.  We may disagree about a lot of things, but on this point, we should agree fundamentally. Part of our obligation is to call before us Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and, separately, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as former FBI Director Jim Comey, to hear from them their views of this tragic and terrifying episode in our history. This firing must be a subject for our investigation. We owe it to the American people.  I thank my colleagues in advance for proving that this investigation is no charade. It is no hoax. It is deadly serious, and the failure to appoint an independent prosecutor could be deadly to our democracy.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

11659,topic-id,1410,"Mr.President, there is a reason we are talking about healthcare, and we should be talking about healthcare. We should be looking for the gaps and trying to find those gaps. I had a long conversation this morning about people who have disabilities, adults who have disabilities, and the challenges they have always faced in the insurance marketplace. They are people like Dan and Lidia who have a hard time working or are unable to have a full-time job, who may be covered by insurance through their parents until they are too old, or they may not be covered because their parents aren't covered. But normally, if that has been the case, where you were able to share whatever coverage your parents had--and certainly this is an area we should work on, how we deal with those who are disadvantaged. On the Medicaid front, our goal should be to look at the House bill and make it better.  The people who were added to Medicaid under President Obama's healthcare plan, decided by the States--the very group who my friend from Maine said shouldn't be making these kinds of decisions--the States made these decisions because it was left to them to make them. And they weren't children and they weren't old people; they were single adults who traditionally had not been covered by We can talk all we want to about how these cuts are going to affect children and old people, but that is not who would be affected.  There is a debate the States have already had. Some States added single adults for the first time, and others didn't. Many States believe they can make those decisions better in their own States, to have a healthcare home where somebody has a doctor they could go to. Having coverage doesn't matter if you can't get access to healthcare. Our debate here should be about access to healthcare, and it should be about people who, because of ObamaCare, are having problems with access to healthcare.  President Obama promised that the new plan would bend the cost curve. He said it would bend the cost curve and bring healthcare costs down. I think the topic he was discussing was healthcare coverage costs coming down by $2,500 for the typical family. The cost curve got bent all right, but it didn't get bent down, it got bent up. In our State, just last year in Missouri, 25 percent was the average increase from one year to the next. The individual policies in many of our counties--84 percent have only one insurance company that is willing to offer a plan. That should tell us something right there about whether the exchange idea worked, the way it was put together. It is clearly not working.  We can continue to move forward and act as though that doesn't matter, but it matters a lot. We have 114 counties and the city of Louis, and our constitution functions as if it were a county. One-hundred and fifteen of those entities, the county-like entities--97 of them have only 1 company willing to offer insurance. In all of them, the average increase statewide was 25 percent 1 year over the next, and that is just 1 year, and it is not even next year. Every estimate says that those individual policies will go up even more next year than they did last year.  We can continue to act as though this system is working and not do anything about it, or we can do something about it.  When ObamaCare was implemented, I came to the floor almost every week for the first year to share story after story of people and families who were affected, who couldn't have the kind of healthcare or the kind of coverage--either one--they had before, and I could share those same stories now. I will share a couple of them today. They haven't stopped coming in. Many people have just decided: We are never going to have the doctors we used to have. We are never going to have the insurance policy we used to have. The government has failed us.  They had a policy on which they were paying maybe a third of what they are paying now and which had higher coverage. But after a while, you quit complaining and understand that your government has actually come up with a system that--for your family, at least--was worse than the system they had.  We talk about cancellation notices being sent out by the thousands. Thousands of families and thousands of individuals got cancellation notices. Last year President Clinton, while campaigning for his wife for President, said: What a crazy system. The costs keep going up, and the coverage keeps going down.  There is clearly something wrong here. We need to do something about it. We should be working together to do something about it.  When I am home and talking to people about this or when people contact our office about this, they just continue to say over and over again that this has gotten worse. Now, we get some calls--and I am glad to get them--where people say: We want to be sure that you understand what happens to individuals like the two people my friend from Maine mentioned. And we are looking for ways to be sure they don't get left out. But let me tell you some of the people who have been left out.  Thomas and Kathy, a married couple from Kansas City, told me that their out-of-pocket costs have jumped from $2,700 in 2014--that was the first year of this healthcare plan--to $5,000 in 2017. In addition, their copays have increased--in their case, they appear to be lucky--by only 20 or 30 percent.  They are not by themselves. Tony, an insurance broker in Northwest Missouri, recently told me about a client who was shopping for coverage. The client realized that the only plan she could afford would force her to spend, for herself, almost $5,000 a year in insurance premiums on top of having another $5,000 deductible before that insurance she would be paying for every month would do any good. She said she would be spending almost $10,000 without receiving anything, and it made absolutely no sense. Well, her insurance broker couldn't help but agreed with her that in her case it didn't make much sense, and I think all of us can see why it might not.  Yesterday at a press event here in the Capitol, I mentioned a farmer who called and said she had a $12,000 deductible for her family and she was paying $16,000 in annual premiums. So in her case, she could pay $28,000 before she had any coverage at all, and that $28,000 was money--she could be paying[[Page S2988]]$12,000 of it just for access to see a doctor because her insurance company didn't help with that.  One final story I would like to share is from Rob, a small business owner in Joseph who pays half of his employees' medical, and his costs keep going up. His agent walks in every year, he told me, and says: Well, this year it went up 9 percent.  He said: That might have been acceptable, except it also went up 9 percent last year and 11 percent the year before that, and it was 9 percent the year before that.  Many of the losses in the individual market are being shifted to try to make the insurance market make up for what is happening on the individual side.  Year over year, we see premium increases, skyrocketing deductibles, and higher out-of-pocket costs. That is the status quo under what we have now, and it is unacceptable. That is why Republicans have made clear that we are going to move forward to solutions that will address some of the major issues in our healthcare system and look for ways to bring down costs and expand access to quality, affordable coverage, but more importantly, quality, affordable care.  I urge my colleagues to work with us and join in this effort to help us find solutions to be sure we don't leave people out who shouldn't be left out but that we also make access to healthcare more possible for more families and more individuals than it is today.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

11579,topic-id,751,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the Police Reporting of Information Data and Evidence Act, or PRIDE Act--legislation I introduced on Thursday, May 25, 2017. This bill would increase accountability and transparency for law enforcement by requiring States to report to the Department of Justice use of force incidents that occur between police officers and civilians. I am proud to have introduced this important bill and I want to thank Senator Chris Van Hollen for joining the legislation as an original cosponsor. I also want to thank Representative Joaquin Castro for introducing a House companion of the PRIDE  Across our Nation, law enforcement officers put their lives on the line each day to protect our communities. These individuals have answered the call to serve, and we owe these brave men and women our deepest respect and gratitude. As mayor of Newark, NJ, I saw firsthand the dangers police officers face each and every day. They must make tough, split-second decisions that have life and death consequences. They truly have one of the toughest jobs in  We must provide law enforcement with the tools and resources they need to do their jobs safely and effectively. That is why I have been a strong advocate for robust funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program, Bulletproof Vest Partnership program, and the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring program. These programs support law enforcement in their mission and help make our communities safe.  While the vast majority of police officers serve with integrity and perform their duties without incident, we know that there are instances when officers engage in inappropriate uses of force. These cases are not emblematic of law enforcement as the whole; however, these incidents have eroded trust between law enforcement and the communities they are sworn to protect. This is especially the case today due to the number of incidents that are caught on video and shared on the internet. This phenomena only exacerbates the difficult job police officers have and fails to lend clarity to the actual number of cases of excessive use of force that occur nationwide.  We must work to shore up that trust deficit and ensure that those who break the law and use excessive force are held accountable and those who rightfully uphold the law are viewed in the correct light. We must collect more data on use of force incidents between law enforcement and civilians. As former Federal Bureau of Investigations Director James Comey said in an address to Georgetown University, ``Without complete and accurate data, we are left with `ideological thunderbolts.' And that helps spark unrest and distrust and does not help us get better.''  For those reasons, I introduced the PRIDE This legislation would require States to report to the Justice Department any incident where use of force is used against a civilian or against a law enforcement officer. It would mandate the collection of certain information such as national origin, sex, race, ethnicity, age, physical disability, mental disability, English language proficiency, housing status, and school status of each civilian against whom law enforcement used force. It would require officers to record the date, time, and location of the incident and whether the jurisdiction allows for the open-carry or concealed-carry of a firearm. It would require the officer to detail whether the[[Page S3552]]civilian was armed and the type of force used and the types of weapons used in the incident. The bill would require the officer to explain why force was used, provide a description of any injuries sustained as a result of the incident, detail how many officers and civilians were involved, and provide a brief description of the circumstances surrounding the incident.  The bill would create a grant program to help smaller law enforcement agencies--those with 100 employees or less--comply with the provisions of the bill. Also, it would allow those agencies to use the grant money to create public awareness campaigns designed to gain information regarding shootings and use of force incidents against police officers. Lastly, the legislation would allow agencies to use the funds to conduct use-of-force training, including deescalation and bias training.  There is no excuse not to collect more data on use of force incidents between law enforcement officers and civilians. Shining a spotlight on these instances will improve police-community relations, vindicate wrongly accused law enforcement officers, and provide lawmakers with the information they need to devise smart and effective policy. I am proud to have introduced the PRIDE Act, and I urge its speedy passage.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-15-pt1-PgS3551-2.txt,2194,COMMUNITY BANKS AND DODD-FRANK,2017.0,15.0,June
11562,topic-id,1010,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for hosting this Special Order on rural  I am a proud resident of a rural district in southern If you are from Illinois, you understand that the ``S'' is capitalized on the word ``southern''; and that is because it is a unique area in itself. It is nowhere near--and there are great people in the Chicago area, but we are farther--well, actually the district starts just across from Louis and goes south to where the Mississippi River and the Ohio River come together. There are a lot of farming communities there.  In my opinion, though, we don't talk enough about our rural communities here on the House floor. So, I am really glad that we are having that opportunity tonight.  In so many ways, you have to realize that our rural areas are the backbone of this country. But if you listen to the media and the advertisers and the Hollywood producers, you would think there wasn't anything between the East Coast and the West But, let me tell you, I am here today to say that there is.  Too many of these small communities are struggling, trying to get through, and, quite often, are weighed down by things that we do here in They want investment. They care about the growth of their communities and they care about jobs.  But when the press talks about jobs, the same industries that come up every time are the tech startups, the consulting firms, the real estate companies, and the new restaurant chains. Those are all good, but one group that doesn't get talked about enough is our farmers.  And let me tell you, that is not something new. It has happened over many years. This Nation's farmers have planted and kept us fed for all the years this great Nation has been in existence.  And I am going to tell you that Benjamin Franklin called farming the only honest way to acquire wealth. Thomas Jefferson said our government would remain virtuous as long as it remained chiefly agricultural. Illinois' own Abraham Lincoln was born into farming and described agriculture as a great calling.  In southern Illinois, beginning farmers tell me their cost of doing business is climbing and their income is shrinking.  This is not the first time this has happened. I want to kind of express a story that took place several years ago.  Right now, in the Agriculture Committee, we are working on the farm bill. Well, the first farm bill came into existence because then-President Ronald Reagan began to hear from the farmers around this Nation of the problems that they were facing and the concerns that they had. And one in particular farmer, a man by the name of Herman Krone, who lives in a little town called Du Quoin, Illinois, about 18 to 20 miles from my home, wrote a letter. Because back then you didn't send emails and you didn't send texts. You actually wrote letters. He sent it to the[[Page H6286]]President, not thinking that he would get a response, but he just wanted to voice his concern of his son Rick, and was Rick going to stay in the family business. Well, he really couldn't because of the high risk of doing business in our agricultural communities.  Well, one night--as a matter of fact, it was a Sunday night, if I remember correctly, because I heard this story from Herman himself before he passed--the phone rang. Now, I understand it wasn't a cell phone, like we have now. It was actually hardwired to the wall. The phone rang, he reached over and picked it up, and someone asked: Is this Herman Krone? Mr.Krone?  He said:  They said: Can you hold for the President?  Herman said: The president of what?  The man on the other end said: The President of the United States, Mr.Ronald  He said: Well, you are kidding me?  The man said: No, Mr.It really is.  Sure enough, the President himself called  He said: Herman, I read your letter, and I realize that you understand what the problems are that the rural farmers are facing today.  He said: I will tell you what I would like to do. I would like to come to your farm. You bring a group of your agricultural people together and I want to talk with them.  And, sure enough, the next month or so, President Ronald Reagan came. The conversation he had, along with other conversations he had around this United States, led to the first farm bill.  We are working on that farm bill right now. But farming and ranching operations are getting squeezed, due to low commodity prices, just like they were then. And the need for increased credit, in order to expand the diversity, has to be done.  Small family-owned businesses are most affected. We hear about corporate farming, but the fact is, 97 percent of American farms are family-owned farms.  That is why one of the bills that I have introduced is known as the BALE Act, which is to modernize the Guaranteed and Direct Loan program at the USDA to better reflect the costs of farming because times have changed. It is our job here in this House to remember that we are dealing with those rural areas and the farmers that are in them.  Now, this will help the next generation of producers make their mark on the industry. As Republicans and Democrats, we need to work together on more ideas like this one. We need to keep focused on the heartland because these are the red-blooded Americans who love their country and deserve a voice.  By addressing the needs of hardworking families who are too often forgotten, we can strengthen these communities for generations to come. It really is all about the next generation.  Each one of us in this House hopes and prays that this Nation holds and grows, and the next generation has to come up. We need that generation of farmers to make sure that they stay on the farm.

11781,topic-id,781,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. This rule provides a[[Page H4665]]structured process for debate and makes in order six amendments to the bill.  Mr.Speaker, we are here today to return hope and opportunity to Main Street America through the Financial CHOICE This legislation touches at the very heart of our economy, ensuring that our financial system facilitates job creation, economic growth, and fairness.  Nearly 10 years ago, the American economy cratered. The Great Recession of the late 2000s revealed that our financial system was fragile, and many Americans got the short end of the stick.  In 2010, Democrats passed H.4173, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection They promised the bill would lift the American economy. They promised an end to Wall Street bailouts. They promised to protect consumers. Seven years later, we know that these promises never came true.  Due to Dodd-Frank's excessive regulatory burden, big banks are getting bigger while small banks and credit unions are disappearing. There have only been six new bank charters since Dodd-Frank--a drastic decline from the 170 on average per year before the bill. In fact, 43 percent of banks with assets under $100 million have disappeared.  Large banks survive because they can afford armies of lawyers to understand Dodd-Frank regulations. In 2010, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein even suggested his bank would be among the biggest beneficiaries of Dodd-But for community banks with community budgets, the effects of the law have been devastating.  Dodd-Frank also failed to address the too-big-to-fail problem. Under the Dodd-Frank law, big banks are growing larger, and taxpayers are still responsible for bailing them out. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank has made access to banking and credit more difficult for average Since the passage of the bill, bank fees have increased and millions more Americans are now considered unbanked or underbanked.  Declining liquidity has limited access to credit for small businesses and the regulatory restrictions on mortgages have pushed homeownership out of reach for the middle class. Seventy-two percent of community banks say that the Dodd-Frank regulations restrict their ability to offer mortgage loans.  Mr.Speaker, this is not the price we must pay to be a hopeful and prosperous nation. That is why I am here supporting the Financial CHOICE It repeals Dodd-Frank, replacing the harmful law with reasonable regulations that ensure consumer protection, job growth, economic growth, and strong community banks.  The Financial CHOICE Act ends the coddling of big banks. It implements historically tough penalties on financial fraud and insider trading. It ends taxpayer-funded bailouts and creates new bankruptcy laws designed for failing banks. It is time that Congress put Main Street ahead of Wall  The Financial CHOICE Act also reins in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency that has incredible power to regulate the financial industry but that has nearly no accountability. The judicial branch has actually declared its structure unconstitutional.  The CFPB is causing problems for consumers. They have a database for complaints from consumers, but it publishes consumer complaints before even checking if they are true. The CFPB also weighs in on financial regulations where Congress should instead be making these decisions, and the CFPB wasted over $200 million on lavish renovations of their office space in downtown Washington, D. This legislation we are considering today will restructure the CFPB, restoring congressional oversight duties and moving the agency back under the regular legislative appropriations process. We will also be refocusing the CFPB on enforcing consumer protection laws, rather than making up their own laws that only hurt the average American consumer.  Perhaps most important to Coloradans, the Financial CHOICE Act creates economic growth and jobs by making credit easier to access for Main Street Thanks to the TAILOR Act, introduced by my friend and colleague from Colorado (Mr.Tipton), regulators will be able to craft custom regulations to reflect the specific business model of local banks.  This bill also creates jobs and economic growth by requiring more transparent policymaking at the Federal We rein in stifling regulations on small, community banks, allowing them to compete against their larger counterparts. We increase consumer choice by ensuring Americans can access a bank and a credit card.  Mr.Speaker, we have the opportunity today to transform our Nation's financial system. We have the opportunity to level the playing field between big and small banks. We have the opportunity to turn up the heat on financial fraud. We have the opportunity to return regulatory power from the hands of unelected bureaucrats to the people. We have the opportunity to roll back hurtful regulations.  We are here to restore hope and opportunity through the Financial CHOICE  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4664.txt,2233,1300,2017.0,7.0,May

Mr.Speaker, small businesses and families are the backbone of small rural communities like the ones I represent in western North The fact is that Dodd-Frank has had a crushing impact both on the ability of families and small businesses to access loans and the financial products that they need and deserve.  Half of what community banks did prior to Dodd-Frank was lending to small businesses. Now it is down to 20 percent of what they do. That is as a result of massive regulations that have come about as a result of Dodd- For families, the availability of services that they used to commonly think is acceptable, like free checking and mortgage lending, are significantly diminished or altogether gone for them. Since Dodd-Frank became law, nearly three-quarters of community banks have either left or greatly reduced their mortgage businesses. This is problematic for families. The impact of these changes has hit rural communities like the ones I represent in western North Carolina the hardest.  But it doesn't end there. The law's mandates have driven up the cost of borrowing, making it harder and more expensive for families to access credit or save for important life events like saving for your child's college education.  Mr.Speaker, the Financial CHOICE Act changes much of this. It begins to undo the damage caused by Dodd-Frank by removing onerous Washington mandates, very expensive regulations, by cutting off access to financial products that the American people need and desire.  Additionally, the Financial CHOICE Act actually addresses the plight of small businesses by cleaning up these messy regulations that are unclear, that have made the marketplace less safe and secure for lending and small businesses, and encouraging the use of innovative new forms of capital formation that help businesses grow and prosper.  That means jobs. This bill is directed at growing the American economy, getting us back on our feet, and helping expand prosperity not just to urban or rural areas, but to both, to all  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this important bill and get on with the business of legislating.

11695,topic-id,194,"Mr.Speaker, a labor union's purpose is simple: to represent its members and to bargain on their behalf. But for millions of Americans who are currently paying union dues, their money is sometimes being used for political advocacy that they may not support.  The First Amendment in our Constitution grants workers around the country the freedom to donate or not to donate to any political cause. As it currently stands, however, union members have to opt out of having their dues spent on certain political activity. This process can be burdensome, and it can be complicated and time consuming.  Instead of asking workers to go through a lengthy process just to avoid funding political causes they don't support, they should have the choice from the start whether to opt in to that spending or not.  Earlier this week, I introduced the National Paycheck Protection Act that would require an employee's consent before their labor organization dues are used for any purpose not directly related to collective bargaining.  Mr.Speaker, union members are Americans before they are Republicans or Democrats, and this simple change would be the first step in the fight for more worker freedom.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgH2907-6.txt,,SOUTH ASIAN HEART HEALTH AWARENESS AND RESEARCH ACT,2017.0,27.0,June

11846,topic-id,2183,"Mr.President, I rise, as well, to talk tonight about the issue of healthcare. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for looking down the road to when, maybe, we can actually work together on this issue. We are in conflict this week, and that is not a place any of us want to be.  We are in conflict because of the elements of this bill. I will make two basic points in my remarks tonight, one about Medicaid and then one point about another provision in the bill that I think is particularly insulting.  A lot of our discussions start with policy and data, and that is important. That is obviously part of the debate about the bill and what is in it and what impact it will have on programs and people over a long period of time, but part of this debate, of course, is about the people we represent. I know the Presiding Officer understands this, and I am heartened that he is paying attention to our arguments because sometimes--I have done it myself--when you preside, sometimes you are doing something else. So we are grateful for his attention.  I have talked on this floor a couple of times over the last couple of weeks--even months--and I will not repeat the stories because they have been told a number of times, but Rowan Simpson is a young man whom I recently just met. His mom had sent me a letter. Rowan is on the autism spectrum, and his mom is very worried about his future because of the potential impact on Medicaid and the benefits he is getting today from  I just referred the other day--I guess it was Thursday on the floor--to a letter from a dad about his son Anthony, who has a number of challenges, one of them being that he is on the autism spectrum. I have another letter, as well, which I will not go through tonight, but it is from a mom in Northeastern Pennsylvania, who wrote to me about two of her children--principally, her son who has Type 1 diabetes and what the loss of Medicaid coverage will mean for that child, who, in this case, is just 4 years old.  Everyone in this Chamber in both parties has stories like this to tell--stories about people who are, because of a disability, totally dependent upon That is not unique to one State, and, of course, it is not unique to one party.[[Page S3773]]  One of the more egregious and objectionable parts of this 140-plus page bill is the impact it will have on Medicaid--the Medicaid expansion, which many people now know represents probably on the order of 11 million people who got healthcare coverage since 2010 and got that coverage because Medicaid was expanded. But the bill also speaks to the Medicaid Program itself by the so-called per capita cap, capping the dollars the Federal Government would provide in the future with regard to the Federal-State partnership on These are big stakes when it comes to a program that has been with us for 50 years.  As everyone knows, Medicaid is principally about individuals with disabilities, and that is obviously those children I mentioned. It is about folks who need some help getting into a nursing home, senior citizens. Of course, it is about kids from low-income families who have no other healthcare, absent In our State, there happen to be 1.1 million kids on Medicaid who are from low-income families. The disability number in both children and adults is, by one estimate, more than 722,000 people. These are big stakes, even if it is just involving one of those individuals or hundreds or thousands. But as I will refer to later, some of the numbers are, of course, a lot higher than that. So those stories and those pleas for help from those families obviously do not just inform us, but they inspire us to keep working, to keep fighting. I will be fighting against this bill as long as it takes.  It is likely that we will have a vote this week. I am assuming we will, so we have only hours and a few days to fight and point out what we believe to be the defects. One of the things that is significant about this debate is that we have had people not just writing those stories and telling us their story but also telling us and giving us ideas about how to conduct the debate and how to fight and how to oppose it.  I have in my hand--I will describe it first before I offer a consent request. I have in my hand several pages that list almost 600 names from people in Pennsylvania who have written to me over the last number of weeks and months, actually. What they are urging me to do is to pursue a legislative strategy to protect their healthcare. Why are they doing that? It is not because they have nothing else to do. They are worried. These people are really worried. They are worried about those kids like Rowan and Anthony, whom I just mentioned, and a 4-year-old with Type 1 diabetes or a whole long list of other disabilities a lot of kids have. They are worried about their parents, who may not be able to get the long-term care they need if Medicaid is capped and cut and decimated. They are worried about their friends and their families. They are, in a word, as worried as anyone has ever been about the healthcare of those they love and the healthcare of those they care about. That is why they have been writing and going to meetings and making phone calls and engaging in such a robust way, all these weeks and months.

11847,topic-id,1601,"Mr.President, I will make two final points about Medicaid and then juxtapose Medicaid with another part of the bill. If you look at the bill--it is about 140, I guess, 142 pages--more than 60 pages deal with So this is principally a bill about There are some other issues, obviously, addressed on the exchanges and the fundamentals of healthcare. But it is mostly about Medicaid and tax cuts, unfortunately; and that is particularly objectionable to me that you have a small group of very wealthy people who are going to make out in ways we can't even imagine, like a big bonanza for the superrich.  Now, let me just talk about the Medicaid part of it first, and then I will refer to a chart. I am holding in my hand the Congressional Budget Office report from today, which came out. It, of course, is a document produced by the Congressional Budget Office as well as the Joint Committee on Taxation so it is a joint effort.  On the CBO--so-called CBO Congressional Budget Office report, recently--a couple weeks ago now--on page 17 of that document, there was an assessment made of the number of people who would lose Medicaid as a result of the House bill, and that number was 14 million Americans would lose Medicaid over the decade up until 2026.  Well, unfortunately, as of 4 p.m. or something this afternoon--I guess about 4 p.m., 4:30--we got the Congressional Budget Office assessment of the Senate bill, the Senate bill that was unveiled last week. Not on page 17 of this report but actually on page 16, here is what the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation says about enrollment in I am quoting from the bottom of page 16:       Enrollment in Medicaid would be lower throughout the coming      decade, with 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026 than      projected under current law in CBO's March 2016 baseline.  Then, they refer to a figure in the report.  So the House bill CBO assessment says 14 million will lose Medicaid coverage. The Senate bill, analyzed by CBO, which is supposed to be a more moderate bill, a better bill in the eyes of some Republican Members of the House and the Senate, that was supposed to be better, but here is what we know now: 15 million people will lose That alone should cause any Senator to be very concerned about the impact of this legislation. That alone should, I hope, require some people to use an old expression: Examine your conscience about what will happen if you vote for this legislation.  Let's say someone says: Do you know what? I can put that into context, and I think actually that will not happen or I have another explanation or whatever justification or rationale you use for voting for a bill that will result in 15 million people losing Medicaid coverage. People are very vulnerable. Let's just say you can analyze that a different way and come to a different conclusion. We will see how people deal with that number this week when they go home and when they have to talk about this legislation over time.  Here is where it gets a lot worse. This is a chart that is rather simple. Even though it has a lot of data on it, it is rather simple. Here is what it says at the top. First of all, this isn't my chart; it is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' chart. You can go to cbpp.org to see it.  This is based upon the House bill, but I just told you that the Medicaid enrollment number is 1 million higher--or that the number losing Medicaid is 1 million higher under the Senate bill, and the tax cuts that are in the Senate bill are almost identical. You can just go down and count them. The House and Senate bill are virtually identical on tax cuts.  Here is what the headline is: Tax cuts for the top 400 roughly equal to Federal spending cuts from ending Medicaid expansion.  Now, remember, I said before that Medicaid expansion is one problem I see. The per capita cap is another. This chart just deals with one of the Medicaid problems--Medicaid expansion--so ending Medicaid expansion in Nevada, West Virginia, Arkansas, and Alaska, just four States, right? Alaska, they project, will lose $2 billion worth of Medicaid over the decade, Arkansas would lose $7 billion, West Virginia would lose $12 billion, and Nevada would lose $12 billion. That adds up to $33 billion Federal Medicaid cuts from ending Medicaid expansion. So $33 billion dollars just for By the way, these are not really high-population There is no California, New York, Texas or big States like that. So $33 billion lost in Medicaid in just those four  What does this orange bar graph show? The same number, $33 billion tax cut for the 400 highest income households in the country. It is the same number. So 400 households get a tax cut of $33 billion, not in some other bill down the road, not in some other year, not in a budget bill or a tax bill. They get this massive tax cut in what is called a healthcare bill. At the same time, it is equivalent to the total Medicaid lost in just four  It gets worse if you add more Guess what. If you add up about 30 States in a different chart, it is about the same as all the tax cuts together, but here we are just talking about four States and 400 families.  I hope I am not offending anyone if they are in those top 400 households who are making either billions or, by one estimate, the average might be $300 million. I know it has been difficult to make ends meet. You have been struggling and trying to pay the mortgage and the light bill when you are one of the top 400 richest households in the country.  But this chart, when you juxtapose this chart--and especially the orange part, the tax cut for 400 families, the giveaway to families who don't need it. Frankly, they don't even want this tax cut. I haven't found one person who came up to me in the last couple of years and said: You know what, I wish my taxes didn't go up. I wish those[[Page S3775]]taxes didn't go up while you were trying to help people on Not a single person said that.  Most people who will get this tax cut would rather that we make sure we take care of those children I mentioned with the disability or those families who need the protection of  When you put this chart next to the policy and those 60-plus pages of the decimation of Medicaid, there are a lot of words we could use that we are not allowed to use on this floor, but one of the words we should use is ``obscene.'' That is an obscenity. When you match these cuts for 400 families next to the cuts to Medicaid, that is obscene, obnoxious, and bad policy.  If there was ever a reason to take this 142-page bill and throw it in the trash, throw it in a garbage pail as fast as we can, it would be this chart because that is not what the American people are asking for. They actually think some people in the Senate are actually working on a healthcare bill. That is what they believe. A lot of people don't know about this yet, but they are going to know. They are going to know by the end of the week, at least, if not sooner, that the 400 richest households in the country are getting that much money--$33 billion. Maybe in the Senate bill it is only $32 billion or $31 billion, so we will stand corrected if it goes down, but that is really an abomination. That is an insult to the American people. People should be ashamed this is part of that bill.  I get it. We can have a debate about I get that, but when you are taking Medicaid dollars and transferring to wealthy people, no one should support that kind of a policy, but that is what we have. That is what we are up against.  If there was ever a reason to fight to the ends of the Earth against a piece of legislation, it is this. We are going to continue to fight this. We are going to continue to point out this basic inequity, this insult for the rest of this week.  We hope folks on both sides of the aisle will not only be listening, but we hope our Republican friends will take another look at this bill and understand how objectionable this is to so many American families. All of that worry I talked about before is made worse, is aggravated by this kind of result when it comes to tax cuts.  We can do all that as a great nation. We can make sure wealthy folks who need a break once in a while--they have gotten a lot of them in the last 25 years--that they can get a fair tax code. We could also make sure kids with disabilities, seniors, and kids in rural areas and big cities and small towns can get the healthcare they need from We are a great country. We can do that. We can have a growing economy and still support a critically important program like  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-26-pt1-PgS3768-3.txt,1828,1300,2017.0,26.0,June
11865,topic-id,1541,"Mr.President, before us as the Senate right now, aside from issues Mr.Blumenthal referred to, is the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care  I am a physician, and I have been practicing in hospitals for the uninsured for the last 25 years. I would like to in one sense say that gives me special standing to speak about this issue, but in reality, it does not.  Senator Moran from Kansas spoke up the other day at our lunch. He said that healthcare is like no other issue. He spoke of a friend of his approaching him at church with tears rolling down her face. Her mother had a preexisting condition, and she was so concerned that we get this right.  I don't need to say I have special standing, being a physician. We all have special standing from living, having families and friends who--sooner or later, healthcare will affect the family.  The Affordable Care Act for many is not working. Premiums are going sky high.  Two or 3 days ago, I had communication with someone from San Her young family has a $20,000-a-year premium, a $6,000 deductible for each member of the family--in San Francisco, already paying so much for housing, food, and transportation, and $20,000 on top of that for a family of relatively modest income.  Then I spoke to someone in Washington, His family's premium is $24,000; they have a $13,000 deductible. He said: I am out $37,000 before my insurance kicks in. I reassured him that his colonoscopy would be for free. I don't think he thought that funny.  Then a friend of mine who last year in Louisiana--his quote for a policy for himself and his wife, 60 and 61, was $39,000 for 1 year--$39,000 for 1 year--with a deductible.  Now we are being told there will be premium increases this coming year. In Connecticut, they just announced they are going to be 15 to 35 percent higher. In my own State, I have been told they may approach 30 to 40 percent higher, although that is not definite.  The reality is that premiums have become unaffordable. President Trump campaigned on this. There were four things he told the American people. He said he wanted to cover all, care for those with preexisting conditions, eliminate the Affordable Care Act mandates that people hate so much, and lower premiums.  I would like to say I think it is part of President Trump's intuitive genius. Whatever you say about the fellow, he certainly has an intuition sometimes about how things work. Of course, the way you would lower premiums is that you would cover all, and by covering all, you expand the risk pool, which then lowers premiums for those with preexisting conditions but keeps them lower for the rest of us.  Folks ask how you can do that without mandates, and I say you can do it through the mechanism of the Cassidy-Collins plan, the Patient Freedom Act, which is to say you have an auto-enrollment feature.  By the way, here is President He said it many times, but here he is in the Washington Post on January 15, 2017, just before he takes the oath of office:       ``We're going to have insurance for everybody,'' Trump      said. ``There was a philosophy in some circles that if you      can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to      happen with us.''  You cannot have a stronger statement from a fellow who is about to rise to be inaugurated and gives a speech in which he speaks passionately about the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. President Trump pledged to remember them.  The question is, How do you lower premiums? How do you fulfill President Trump's goals?  There are several ways to lower premiums. I just described one, where you fulfill the other parts of his contract with the voter, which is you cover all, and by doing so, you increase the size of the risk pool, and therefore you lower premiums. There is another mechanism. You can put in price transparency and do other things to lower the cost of medical care, which in turn lowers the cost of healthcare premiums. But there is one way which is not so good. One way that you can lower cost is to have a crummy policy that hardly covers anything. You think you are getting a deal in the front end because premiums are low, and then you or someone in your family gets sick, and it is not such a great deal after all.  I was asked about this on a Sunday morning show and spontaneously came up with something called the Kimmel test. Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night comedian, spoke of his son being born. We can all imagine--this happened 2 weeks ago--his child was born. I suspect somebody is videoing it. It is going to be a moment of celebration. As the child emerges and everybody wants to lean forward and hand the child to the mother and the father to hold and cuddle, instead, the doctor and the nurse notice that the child is blue--``blue'' meaning he is not getting enough oxygen. It is quickly realized that something is profoundly wrong. Instead of mother and father hugging and bonding with the child, they are pushed to the side. They hear a code blue call, which means this child will die if something is not done immediately.  I was not there, but I have been in similar situations.  They are being asked to sign forms which would allow this child--their child whom they have not yet held--to be transported by helicopter across Los Angeles to have emergency surgery that day and being told that if they do not sign this form, that child will die.  Now, Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that he is a millionaire, he could afford it, but he also pointed out: Others, not so much.  I think that brings us back to what President Trump said. President Trump said:       ``We're going to have insurance for everybody. There was a      philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you      don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.''  The Jimmy Kimmel test: We will protect those with preexisting conditions, but we will do it by lowering premiums and not by giving crummy coverage but, rather, by having adequate coverage. So if our approach passes the Kimmel test, then we feel it is a way to go.[[Page S2909]]  Now, how do we go from here?  We can recognize that premiums are too high for middle-class families. They can no longer afford it, and that is before the premium increases, which are about to occur.  I will also say that as to the way the Affordable Care Act was passed--not blaming or praising anyone--that only one party was engaged is not the path forward. History says that any time there is significant social legislation that has an enduring effect in the United States, both parties engage.  I want this to change. I would challenge my Democratic colleagues to become engaged. Some have said: Oh, my gosh, Republicans are doing this through reconciliation; isn't that terrible?  I would say it presents opportunity. We don't need 12 Democrats; we don't need 8 We could have three Democrats or four Anyone who cares enough about the people in their State and their premiums, which are rising 20 to 40 percent a year, will put aside all the pressure from a political base and say: The people of my State are more important than the political pressure I may feel. They will step forward to influence the final product.  We know that if folks come in from the other side of the aisle, we will have a different product than if it is only among If Republicans had participated in the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we would have had something perhaps a little different than the Affordable Care  I am not pointing fingers. I am just observing that it would only take three or four Democrats to break ranks, to step across the aisle, and to ask for what they would need. This is not: You come to us, and you don't get it--no. We have a meeting of the minds so that we can come to the policy that fulfills President Trump's pledge--his pledge to cover all, caring for those with preexisting conditions, eliminating mandates, and lowering premiums.  We have an incredible opportunity before us to bring relief to those middle-class couples struggling with premiums that they can no longer afford and deductibles that they will never meet. If they don't meet and can't afford them and if they do not purchase the insurance, they are being fined and are accumulating resentment toward Washington because they are stuck with this. We can address that issue and at the same time fulfill President Trump's pledge that all will have coverage.  Some said you can't get it if you can't pay, but that is not going to be the case with us. It will provide them that coverage with something that passes the Kimmel test. I look forward to working with our Senate to come to this solution.  I yield back.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-05-11-pt1-PgS2906.txt,1925,1345,2017.0,11.0,June

Today I wish to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Lister-Knowlton VFW Post 9389 in Caribou,  The name of Post 9389 signifies a fundamental purpose of the VFW: to honor those who gave their lives for freedom. Private Evan Lister and CPL Edward Knowlton were both born in Caribou, both served in the U.Army during World War II, and both made the ultimate sacrifice when they were each just 23 years old. Neither will ever be forgotten. Nor will we ever forget those who returned home but who have since passed into history. It is sobering to note that today there is just one living charter member of the Caribou post, WWII veteran David Michaud, and we honor him for his service.  In 2003, the Northern Maine Veterans Cemetery was dedicated in This final resting place for our heroes was the result of many years of hard work and determined advocacy by committed citizens, with our VFW post leading the way. My father, Donald Collins, a decorated World War II veteran, was among those who made that enduring tribute possible.  A defining quality of America's veterans is that they continue to serve long after their service in uniform ends. Members of the Caribou VFW and the auxiliary are part of a vast network that assists the patriots serving today, fellow veterans, and their families. They generously support a wide range of community projects, charitable endeavors, and youth programs. One of the most important contributions made by the VFW is its focus on educating our young people on American values. Each year, more than 175,000 high school and middle school students nationwide join in the VFW's Voice of Democracy and Patriot's Pen essay competitions. That wonderful level of participation is always matched by the quality of the submissions.

Not every individual in America has that opportunity. So those of us that grew up with that upbringing in rural America should appreciate that.  That is why, when I took the oath of office as a brand-new Congressman back in November, I said my number one priority is to promote agriculture and restore and revive rural I believe we can.

That is why our best and brightest young people graduate from the good public schools that we have in rural America, they go off to college or technical school, but they don't come back. There aren't the same opportunities, unfortunately, in many of the rural communities as there are in the more urban and suburban areas.  I believe that we can change that because rural America has so much to offer. We have work ethic. We have available skilled workers. We have communities where everyone knows everyone. Everyone has a spirit of community. We have good churches, good schools, and good rural hospitals.

11647,topic-id,478,"Madam President, I know people outside the beltway think nothing ever happens here--and certainly that nothing ever happens on a bipartisan basis--but they would be wrong on both counts.  Last night, the Senate passed a piece of bipartisan legislation called the American Law Enforcement Heroes It is a great example of legislation everyone can agree on and get behind.  The main goal is to connect veterans--those who have served in our military and have a passion for public service--to opportunities in State and local law enforcement. When we think about it, who better than our retiring military personnel who are accustomed to wearing one uniform, moving then into the civilian law enforcement world wearing another uniform but continuing their legacy of public service. That way, those who have voluntarily put themselves in harm's way to keep the peace and promote American interests abroad and defend our homeland can continue the record of public service at home.  For veterans, that can mean a rewarding job in law enforcement. Through their training, experience, and sacrifice, there is no doubt that our veterans are equipped with valuable skills to keep our communities safe. By prioritizing existing Federal funds for State and local law enforcement agencies to hire veterans, we can better serve them as they transition into civilian life. We know that can be a challenging transition, but that is exactly what the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act that we passed yesterday does.  For State and local law enforcement groups, that means they can attract the best qualified men and women who are eager to serve their country in a new way. So this is really a win-win.  Fortunately, this legislation builds on the good work already underway in places like my home State of Over the last several months, I have had a chance to visit cities and counties all over the State that are actively recruiting veterans to serve as police officers or sheriffs. That includes law enforcement leaders from San Antonio to Houston, to Fort As my colleagues may recall, following the terrible killing of five police officers and shooting of seven more in Dallas, Police Chief David Brown made an appeal for people who were protesting or otherwise concerned about the law enforcement agencies involved to sign up and join them--to be a part of the solution and not just protesting the problem.  Thankfully, we have set a tremendous example in Texas of how hiring veterans to serve as law enforcement officers benefits all of our communities. I am glad this bill will follow their inspiration and help communities across the country hire more veterans.  I said before that this legislation is something everyone can agree on, in a polarized political environment, and that is of course evident by the broad bipartisan support it has received.

11678,topic-id,979,"Mr.President, over the weekend I heard a story I wanted to share with everyone here today. The story goes that there were three candles burning on a porch right across the street from the Cornwell Funeral Home in Dardanelle, AR--my hometown, just a couple blocks away from my home. A family had lit them in the memory of the three people who were brutally murdered last week in Chickalah, just a few miles outside of  One of those slain was Lieutenant Kevin Mainhart of the Yell County Sheriff's Department, who was killed after he stopped a man wanted in a domestic disturbance. In honor of his 5 years of service to Yell County--on top of the 20 years of service he rendered to the West Memphis Police Department--his fellow officers escorted in their cruisers the white hearse carrying his body from the State crime laboratory in Little Rock back to  The family across the street had lit a green candle, specifically for Lieutenant Mainhart, and the three candles burned all the night. But as the hearse pulled into the funeral home, the green candle suddenly went out.  You could say that it was nothing more than a strange coincidence, but I think there is something especially poignant about the sudden, tragic loss of Lieutenant Mainhart's life so close to National Police Week, which began on Like that green candle, Lieutenant Mainhart lit up his community, and, like that flickering flame, his life was too brief.  Like every American this week, I wish to pay my respects to Lieutenant Mainhart and the noble profession he chose. One of the things which struck me about Lieutenant Mainhart's death was that it came so early in the morning. The stop occurred at 7:18 a.m. He had the whole day and his whole life in front of him.  He was only 46 years old, but he had made the most of his time on this He was a husband, a father, an Air Force vet, a beloved member of our community. Hundreds of people don't line the streets for just anybody. Yet, in a moment, he was gone--his family bereft, our community in mourning. It is a reminder of how precious and fragile every life really is.  It also goes to show just how brave every police officer really is, because this is the risk they take every morning. They put on the uniform, they kiss their families good-bye, and they go to work, never fully certain they will get home that night. Yet the ever-present threat of death doesn't hold them down. It doesn't hold them back. It doesn't dim the brilliance of their service. They give it their all, day after day, without giving it a moment's thought. That, to me, is the ultimate sign of character--when you do the right thing without even thinking about it.  People like this are hard to come by. The sad truth is, we need a lot of them. A free country always does, because there is no freedom without security. We are so used to this basic fact--that for most of us, most of the time we are safe--that we forget how remarkable it is. Not so many people on God's green Earth can take that safety for granted. We often forget what it takes to secure it. We forget how easily we can lose it--and lose men and women like Lieutenant Mainhart--in an instant.  It is with this in mind--this grave understanding of what our safety requires--that I once again speak against continued efforts to water down Federal sentencing laws. I thought this ill-advised idea had expired last year, especially after Donald Trump's election. But advocates for criminal leniency are at it again, even though violent crime continued to rise in our cities for 2 years straight, and law enforcement officers are being killed in the line of duty.  I have already made my position clear. If we want to take a second look at punishments for first-time drug possession, let's do that. But we should know that fewer than 500 people are in Federal prison for such offenses. If we want to clean up our prisons, rehabilitate felons, and help them achieve redemption, by all means, let's do that, too. I would even consider a bill to speed up review of inmates' applications for pardons and commutations, to help the President exercise this constitutional authority. But we should not--we should not--lower mandatory minimums for violent crimes, repeat offenders, and drug trafficking. There is nothing compassionate about putting the lives of innocent people--and our law enforcement officers--at risk.  Lieutenant Mainhart isn't the only one. There were three police officers killed in the line of duty last year in Arkansas: Robert Barker in the McCrory Police Department, William Cooper in the Sebastian County Sheriff's Office, and Lisa Mauldin in the Miller County Sheriff's Every one of these losses was too steep a price to pay, and unwise criminal leniency policies put at risk their fellow officers and our communities.  I know it is considered old-fashioned to be tough on crime--or, even worse, cold-hearted and mean. But a man doesn't put a lock on his door because he hates those on the outside. He does it because he loves those on the inside--his wife, his kids, all his family--because they are the joy of his life. The men and women of law enforcement don't just protect their own families--they protect all of our families. Every day those men and women put their lives on the line for their fellow citizens. The least we can do is to stand behind them and support them, both for the work they do and for the lives they lead.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

11870,topic-id,652,"Mr.President, I am speaking tomorrow at an Air Force ROTC commissioning ceremony at the University of As I have been preparing my remarks, I have been thinking a lot about the airmen who have left more than contrails behind them--the men and women who served with such distinction that we still remember them to this day, those great Americans, the heroes of the sky.  The first name that came to mind, the name that resounded louder than almost any other is the great Leo Thorsness, so you can imagine how saddened I was to hear about his passing last week. Whenever you hear such a legend has left the Earth, it is like a sudden crack of thunder in the dead of night. It wakes you up. It sobers you. It reminds you of what we have lost because Leo Thorsness was an American classic.  Born in Walnut Grove, MN, his childhood sounds as idyllic as his hometown. He joined the Boy Scouts and later rose to become an Eagle He met his wife Gaylee in the freshman registration line at South Dakota State They married 3 years later and had one daughter, He joined the Air Force, went to flying school, and became a pilot.  Soon, he was a fighter pilot in both the Strategic and Tactical Air Looking back on his life, we can see Leo Thorsness was part of an era--those burly, self-confident, middle-class families who, after the Great Depression and the greatest of wars, put down roots and built the booming America of the mid to late 20th century.  Of course, Leo was not simply a part of his generation; he inspired it with his courage and self-sacrifice. For many Americans, the only number they remember from the Vietnam years is their draft number. But for Leo Thorsness, there are two numbers that stick out: 88 and 93.  It was on his 88th mission for the Air Force that he performed the noble deeds for which he would later receive the Medal of He was flying an F-105 Thunderchief with his weapons specialist, Harold They were escorting fighter bombers targeting a North Vietnamese army barracks. They shot down a MIG, roughed up another, and hit two missile batteries. They were low on ammo and fuel, but they fought on. He continued to scare off MIGs and instructed a tanker plane to refuel another fighter. When he finally landed 70 miles south in Thailand, the fuel tank was on empty. It was a stunning act of bravery.  It was on his 93rd mission, just seven shy of completing his tour of duty,[[Page S2912]]that Leo Thorsness was shot down. He was captured and spent 6 years in the ``Hanoi Hilton''--6 years in the darkness. It was there that he met his cellmate, our colleague and future Senator, John  Imagining 6 days in such a terrible place is more than most people can handle, never mind 6 years. But Leo Thorsness endured; he saw the mission through. When he returned in 1973, it was to an astonished and grateful nation, but the man himself was unfazed. He called his wife after being released and said: ``I would have called sooner, but I've been all tied up.''  He later went on to serve in the Washington State Senate and run for other offices. But his legacy is not one of the titles he won; it is the example he set.  He was quite a man, Leo And though we have lost him, we will keep his memory for a good long time to come.

11597,topic-id,588,"Mr.Speaker, this so-called American Health Care bill is a real Titanic of a sorry piece of legislation: It would sink 23 million Americans losing their health coverage; millions more who have a preexisting condition would face great barriers; it would undermine Medicare; it would provide price-gouging, Big Pharma manufacturers with a huge tax windfall, all as part of almost a trillion dollars in a tax cut--which is what their bill is really all about, not healthcare--those benefits going to a few corporations and the superrich among us.  Most every healthcare professional group in the country along with the AARP and the vast majority of Americans reject this bill. We would have even more people rejecting if it hadn't been hidden, if even one administration official had had the courage to come and be held accountable for this bill in a public hearing. But, apparently, we will not have that anywhere in this Congress before this huge bill is approved.  The American people are locked on board this sinking ship. Our insurance markets are already taking on water from Trump sabotage, and disaster looms in front of us.  This is not a Verify First bill that we take up today; it is a patch on this sinking Titanic ship.  It is not a Verify First; it is a ``Vilify First'' our immigrants, and it is really just the next chapter in Trump's anti-immigrant crusade, which he tweets about on a regular basis.  Our Republican colleagues celebrate this Immigrant Heritage Month, They celebrate the fourth anniversary of 68 Members of the United States Senate, in a bipartisan way, approving comprehensive immigration reform. They do it with this ``Vilify First Act.''  And while I want to protect taxpayers and think we have a responsibility to ferret out and prevent every dime of fraud that might be out there, I also feel a responsibility to struggling families that I represent who already have so many barriers in the way of getting medical coverage to their children.  Not everyone is as fortunate as Jimmy Kimmel, although he had the misfortune of a child born with serious medical needs, he at least had the ability to do something about it. And folks need to be able to access promptly and immediately, sometimes, a family doctor.  We should fight fraud wherever it occurs. I do wish we had the same level of enthusiasm about protecting taxpayers from Medicaid fraud by big pharmaceutical manufacturers, for offshore tax dodging that denies us billions of dollars, as they voice for taking on the poor. We don't have that, but we do need to analyze carefully what the Government Accountability Office that provides the basis for this legislation really said.  They found a need to address $750 million. Under the program, they did not find one dollar, one red cent that an immigrant had taken improperly from this program. They did not document any immigrant fraud. There may be some out there, but you can't rely on this study to find it.  We were asked: Well, why do you think this has anything to do with immigrants? Well, I can tell you why. Because the sponsor of the amendment, who is here on the floor, when he introduced this piece of legislation, said he was after what he called illegal immigrants; and he said that he would not vote for TrumpCare, that sorry Titanic of a bill, he would not vote for it unless this provision was adopted.

11786,topic-id,503,"Mr.Speaker, those wondering why Republican lips are sealed so very tight when it comes to President Trump jeopardizing our national security, threatening our democracy, and engaging in one crazy action after another need look no further than this bill.  You see, this is a bill to handcuff the cop on Wall So many of our Republican colleagues are so eager to shield Wall Street from action and eventually to bestow one tax break after another on Wall Street, that they are willing to pay almost any price in silence concerning Mr.Trump's outrages.  As a person who voted against all of the big bank bailouts, I am most concerned that this bill will produce only more. When the banks were bailed out, American families paid the price, as taxpayers. They paid the price for the recklessness that led to that unnecessary financial crisis.  A more immediate concern is what happens to the cop on the beat, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new law enforcement agency that the AARP described as one designed to hold scam artists accountable. That is exactly what the CFPB has done. Whether it is payday lenders or deceitful language in the fine print of financial agreements, reverse mortgages, contracts denying consumers their legal remedies to address wrongdoing, or many other issues, this agency has been there to protect the consumers.  Among those most threatened that have benefited from this law enforcement agency are our military families, who face unique financial challenges, from illegal foreclosures, to cheating them on student loans, to payday lenders who overcharge their families. This law enforcement agency has been there to protect them. Today, it would be substantially weakened by this legislation.  One of the leading examples of the success of this law enforcement agency is Wells Fargo: fined $100 million, $85 million in restitution, $75 million in claw-backs from executives, a CEO resigned. None of that happened to the other banks, but Wells Fargo was caught. It was caught because there was a law enforcement agency on the beat doing something about it.  There are those who fought this legislation from the start, and they won't give up on trying to undermine it.  You need only look at what happened this year in enforcement actions to see what this agency is doing: a company failed to provide redress for illegal collection tactics, deceived consumers about credit scores, misstated the charges associated with pawn loans, denied consumers access to their own money, and kept borrowers in the dark about options to avoid foreclosure. One bit of wrongdoing after another. Why not have a cop on the beat working for us? Some people want to have the unlimited right to exploit consumers. This agency is the one thing standing in the way to protect them.  I say: stop this Republican interference with law enforcement and send a message at the same time to President Donald Trump that our laws apply to him too, and ought to be enforced against him when he is engaged in wrongdoing.

11650,topic-id,1805,"Mr.President, I rise today to honor our law enforcement officers during National Police Week and to talk about the importance of supporting law enforcement, including their mental health.  During National Police Week, we recognize and remember the sacrifices of the law enforcement officers we lost in the line of duty in 2016. Every day and through every night in communities across Indiana and our country, law enforcement officers are patrolling our streets, arriving at the scenes of challenging and often traumatic incidents, and even putting themselves in harm's way as they do their best to keep our families safe. They help ensure that our children can be safe at the neighborhood playground and our seniors can sit peacefully on their front porch. They help keep drugs off our streets, they are called to the scenes of opioid and heroin overdoses, and they help stem the violence and crime that has plagued many of our communities for far too long.  Our law enforcement officers put on the uniform every day. They head out the door to serve us, while their family members say a prayer hoping they come back safely into their family's loving arms at the end of their shift. Sadly, sometimes they do not.  In my home State of Indiana, our law enforcement lost one of their own last year when the Howard County sheriff's deputy, Carl Koontz, was shot and killed during a raid in Russiaville, IN, last  Deputy Koontz was only 27 years old, in the prime of his life, and had dedicated himself to serving and protecting the communities he loved. He left behind his wife Kassie and their young son  Deputy Koontz's loss was felt not just in Kokomo, not just in Howard County, but in cities and towns across our He represented the very best our State has to offer. He was smart, talented, and service driven, working[[Page S2982]]to make his community a better place to live.  Mr.President, I know your State was stricken this past year, as well, with the loss of the same kind of extraordinary individuals who went and served every day. That is at the core of what law enforcement officers strive for and why it is so devastating when they are lost in the line of duty.  While we pay our respects to those we lost, it is our solemn duty to support those who serve our communities today. As law enforcement officers go through their work, they are sometimes confronted with challenging or even horrific situations.  Recently, I joined with my friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator Todd Young, to introduce the bipartisan Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness It provides tools for law enforcement agencies to help support the mental health and wellness of our brave men and women.  We were thankful to have the support from Senators Blunt, Coons, Cornyn, and Feinstein when we introduced the legislation. I am honored that Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Cruz, Hatch, Klobuchar, Cortez Masto, Durbin, and Tester have added their support in the days since.  I say to the Presiding Officer, thank you for your support of our legislation.  I am very pleased to say that our bill passed the Senate unanimously late yesterday, and it is a major step forward. I am hopeful that our friends in the House of Representatives, where a companion piece was introduced by Congresswoman Susan Brooks and Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida, who served as the first female chief of police in Orlando before coming to Congress--I am hopeful Congresswoman Brooks and Congresswoman Demings can shepherd this bill through that  This legislation is also supported by a number of law enforcement organizations, including the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Major County Sheriffs of America, and more.  I am proud that this is a bipartisan effort, as evidenced by the Members supporting this legislation. It is time to get this to the President's desk to be signed into law as soon as possible.  The Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act is about providing resources to law enforcement agencies that want to better protect their officers' mental health, as well as the providers who strive to serve that unique population. It would direct the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to develop resources for mental health providers to educate them about law enforcement culture and evidenced-based therapies for mental health issues common to law enforcement. It would require the Department of Justice to study the effectiveness of crisis hotlines for law enforcement. It authorizes grants to initiate peer mentoring programs in law enforcement agencies. We are already seeing the success of these programs where the IMPD, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, is utilizing peer mentoring for officer mental health.  During my time in the Senate, our main legislative focus has been to improve the availability of mental healthcare services for servicemembers and their families. We have made great progress in recent years. I am proud that my bipartisan Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act is now law.  As of this September, every servicemember--Active, Reserve, or Guard--is required to have an annual mental health assessment. The Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act builds upon the work our military has been doing to combat suicide and mental health challenges.  It requires the Department of Defense, the VA, and the Department of Justice to consult on military mental health practices that can be adopted by law enforcement agencies. Building on the Sexton Act that requires annual mental health assessments for servicemembers, the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act examines if having annual mental health checks for law enforcement officers would help save lives.  When Senator Young and I announced this legislation last month, we had the honor of being joined by a number of law enforcement professionals, including the Indianapolis chief of police, Bryan Chief Roach shared some of his experiences. He said:       When I am came on, officers were taught to be in control of      their emotions.       We still teach the IMPD to be in control of their emotions.      But if you think about the day in, day out routine of the      things they participate in, and the things that they see, and      they are confronted with on a day to day basis, it is      difficult sometimes to control those emotions, but they do a      very good job of it.       The problem is they take those things home. The things      we're talking about are not just PTSD, but depression and      anxiety.  As the chief stated, law enforcement officers--like the rest of us--don't just turn themselves off when they go home. The experiences they have every day impact them and their family and their friends.  Sheriff Mike Nielsen of Boone County--located in Central Indiana, right near Indianapolis--was also on hand that day with us to share his perspective. He said: In 2015, Captain Nanavaty and the office received national recognition, being awarded the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund's Annual Officer Wellness IMPD's innovation and forward thinking have inspired police departments across the United States to follow their footsteps and undertake similar efforts to address law enforcement mental health and wellness. But this is just the beginning of these efforts.       I have seen things that cannot be unseen. The brave men and      women of police, fire, EMS, are all public safety officers      who put their lives on the line each and every day.       They endure more than anybody can imagine, and they must      deal with the stresses of life both on the job and at home.  Sometimes it is really, really tough. Sheriff Nielsen continued:       We must all work hard to stop the stigma with mental health      issues.       As administrators, we have to train our supervisors how to      recognize signs of PTSD in our staff. We must administer      standard officer wellness programs.       As administrators and public safety, we must lead from the      front, and let our staff know that it is okay to struggle      with issues. That we are only human.       Our emotional mental health heals just like a physical      injury. With the proper treatment, and with time.       We must provide the funding and resources to go beyond the      critical stress debriefing. We must do this for our officers.  Both Chief Roach's and Sheriff Nielsen's comments show us the importance of ending the stigma attached to mental health issues. We can't be afraid of talking about mental health and the ways we support our law enforcement officers as they work through these challenges.  Lebanon police officer Taylor Nielsen, who followed in the tradition of her dad, Sheriff Mike Nielsen--an extraordinary family, serving our State with their lives every day--was courageous enough to share her mental health struggles following a particularly tough assignment.  She recounted the questions that she was dealing with:       Why am I alone? Why isn't anybody else having these issues?      Why can't I get this out of my head? What is wrong with me?      These were the questions that repeatedly ran through my head      on a daily basis last year.       Questions that made me believe that there was something      fundamentally wrong with me.  She continued:       For those of you who feel you are fighting alone, know that      there is relief out there. Please don't be afraid to seek out      those resources. The battle will be hard, but it can be won.  Thanks to her strong will and the help of a trained therapist, Taylor was able to handle her mental health challenges. As she said, though, we have to work together as a team to beat these issues.  We will take time over Police Week to reflect on the law enforcement professionals we lost last year. As we do that, it is important that we take commonsense steps to support our law enforcement officers.  We took a major step forward with yesterday's passage of the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act in the I see my colleague Todd Young, who was my teammate on that, in the Chamber as well. I am hopeful it will be enacted soon so we can bring more tools to law enforcement agencies across Indiana and our country. Congresswoman Brooks and Congresswoman Demings are working on it right now.  After the service and sacrifices law enforcement officers make every day, they have earned the resources we have, so that we can provide the very best to the very best.  Thanks again to Senator Young for working with me on this effort, to the police and sheriffs in Indiana who have lent their support, to law enforcement officers protecting Hoosiers as we stand here at this moment.[[Page S2983]]  May God bless all of these officers, and may God bless the family of Deputy Carl May God bless Indiana, and may God bless  Mr.President, I yield back.

What does the House of Representatives Affordable Care Act repeal do to the programs I have just described? It ends the expansion of It would eliminate coverage for 650,000 people in the State of Think about that. We had seven of our Republican Congressmen vote for a program that will eliminate health insurance under Medicaid for 650,000 people in my State and cut $840 billion in Federal Medicaid funding. Well, if they are going to cut this money for Medicaid funding, what are they going to do with it? The House knew exactly what to do with it: They give it back in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in Is there justice in that decision? Is it too much to ask that those of us who are better off in life pay a little more in taxes so that those who are struggling have basic healthcare? I don't think so, but those who voted for the Republican House plan do. The bill cuts healthcare for struggling families, women, seniors, and children in order to give a tax break to the wealthiest people in  Illinois would lose $40 billion over the next decade, and 3 million people would be at risk of losing their care. Absolutely no one believes Illinois is going to magically come up with $40 billion to fill this Medicaid shortfall. I doubt many other States will be able to either. With funding cuts this dramatic, even Illinois's Republican Governor spoke out against the House action repealing the Affordable Care He said it is going to force us to make significant changes in healthcare in He would have to decide who gets healthcare and who doesn't. He would have to decide whether healthcare services are just too expensive to cover.  Hospitals, too, would be devastated by the proposed Medicaid cuts. I was born and raised in downstate It doesn't look at all like the city of I am proud to represent that city. I enjoyed being there and being a part of it. I grew up in smalltown America, and the congressional district I represented basically was smaller cities--no more than 100,000 population at the time--with a lot of smaller towns. I can't tell you the pride those communities take in downstate Illinois in their hospitals. Some of those hospitals are a lifeline--the only source of healthcare for miles around. They are great employers. They bring in medical specialists who are paid good salaries by local standards.  The Illinois Hospital Association is dead-set against what the House Republicans did in passing their repeal of the Affordable Care They have told us that Illinois stands to lose up to 60,000 healthcare jobs because of that vote in the U.House of Of course, that means that for many of the people who count on these rural hospitals, even inner city hospitals in Chicago, those services are going to be curtailed and denied.  When I sit down with people like Ed Curtis, who is the president of Memorial Medical Center in Springfield and speaks for Illinois hospital administrators across the State--he tells me the devastating impact it will have when Medicaid coverage is eliminated and sick people still show up for care. They will be taken care of; their expenses will be shifted to other people. That is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act, before Medicaid expanded and gave these individuals in low-income situations basic health insurance.  Why would Republicans in the House of Representatives want to have such a devastating negative impact on Medicaid? So they can give tax cuts to wealthy people? That, to me, is inexplicable.  The Illinois Hospital Association speaks across our State for those who really care about those great institutions, but they are not alone in opposing this bill. The Illinois Nurses Association opposes it, as do the Illinois pediatricians and the Illinois Medical Why does every medical advocacy group in Illinois oppose this bill, this so-called Republican reform of our healthcare system? Because they know it moves in the wrong direction. It eliminates healthcare coverage instead of expanding it. It makes healthcare too expensive and out of reach for people who are not lucky enough to have it at work and not wealthy enough to buy it on their own. It moves in the wrong direction. It is not a solution to any problem; it is a new and even worse problem than the ones we faced in the past.  Remember when Candidate Donald Trump tweeted in May of 2015: ``I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there would be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid''? Then he tweeted in July of 2015--``The Republicans who want to cut Social Security and Medicaid are wrong,'' said Candidate He was right, but now he supports this bill which dramatically cuts Medicaid coverage across America.[[Page S2976]]  What is going to happen to the elderly in nursing homes who, despite all their Social Security payments and despite all of their Medicaid reimbursement, still don't have enough resources for the basic care they need to stay alive? When they cut back on that Medicaid coverage, what happens to them? What do their families do to make up the difference? Reach into their savings? Bring mom home from the nursing home in the hopes that they can take care of her in their own home? Those are choices no family should face and no family need face.  I hope the Senate will show the courage and leadership on a bipartisan basis to say no to this terrible bill that passed the U.House of Representatives just 2 weeks ago. We need to put together a bill that expands the coverage of health insurance, gives people more peace of mind; a bill that addresses some of the built-in challenges we had with the Affordable Care Act, which is far from perfect. There are things we can do to improve it.  We need to do something about the cost of pharmaceutical drugs. The current law doesn't really affect that. They are out of control at this point.  Secondly, I think we ought to offer a public option. There ought to be a Medicare-type program available across the United States for those who wish it. Medicare enjoys a very positive reputation in America for good reason. Most Americans would feel honored and happy to be protected by a Medicare-type program.  We also need to go to those premiums that are too high and ask why. In many cases, there are individuals who are buying health insurance from very narrow pools of people who are older and sicker. We need to expand that pool so it is real insurance, and we can bring those premiums down. There are ways to do that.  There are many things we can do with reforming the Affordable Care Act, but what the House of Representatives did, what some want to do, is just repeal it and walk away. It would be devastating to the women in America who rely on Medicaid to pay for their delivery expenses, as well as prenatal and postnatal care. It would be devastating to seniors who are in nursing homes and are dependent on Medicaid supplements and for those who are disabled with chronic conditions and have to turn to Medicaid just to make sure they can maintain their lifestyle and still be productive, happy, and safe. These are the elements and these are the costs we would have to charge if we are not careful.  Wouldn't it be great, wouldn't it be terrific, wouldn't it be a headliner to say that Democrats and Republicans came together in the U.Senate to make the Affordable Care Act better, to make sure there was more accessible, affordable, quality coverage for more Americans? I think that is why we were elected, and I hope we can achieve that goal.

She is one of the most effective champions this Nation has ever seen--and she is still leading the charge. Last week, Joan celebrated her 80th birthday, and one thing is clear, Joan Claybrook isn't slowing down.  Like so many bright young people in Washington, Joan began her career right here in the U.Congress, working for Senator Walter Mondale and Representative James Mackay as a congressional fellow. In the summer of 1966, the Senate unanimously passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, the first major legislation to improve auto safety in this country. This effort was led by consumer advocate, Ralph Nader, and working right by his side was Joan It led to important safety standards we take for granted today: seatbelts, windshield wipers, outside mirrors, and dashboards. This landmark legislation also launched Joan's impressive career as a consumer advocate.  During the Carter administration, Joan served as the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, where she led efforts to improve vehicle safety and increased consumer access to safety information. Prior to her time with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, she ran Congress Watch, worked for the Public Interest Research Group, National Traffic Safety Bureau, Social Security Administration, and the U.Department of Health, Education, and  In 2009, Joan retired as president of Public Citizen, after nearly three decades of service championing consumer interests and campaigning on issues from campaign finance reform, to truck safety, and business regulation. Among her many accolades at Public Citizen, Joan was able to limit the number of triple- and longer double-trailer trucks on the road, and she helped to ensure that health, safety, and environmental agencies were able to continue its important work protecting the American people, but her proudest, and perhaps most impactful, achievement was winning a 20-year battle with the auto industry to install airbags in cars. Because of Joan's work, countless lives have been saved. I want to thank her for these contributions that improved the health and safety for so many across the country.  Joan Claybrook has been honored by numerous organizations, including the Philip Hart Distinguished Consumer Service Award from the Consumer Federation of America, an Excellence in Public Service Award from the Georgetown University Law Center, and an award for Superior Achievement from the National Traffic Safety Bureau--just to name a few. In her precious spare time, Joan serves on the board of Citizens for Tax Justice and Public She also cochairs the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and Citizens for Reliable and Safe  It is not simply Joan Claybrook's extraordinary resume that earned her such great respect; it was her approach to the job. Joan brought humility, integrity, and fairness to every challenge she faced. Her energy, passion, and optimism are infectious, and her continued drive to ensure all Americans have the chance to lead safe and equitable lives make her an inspiration. Joan may have retired, but her commitment to those values has never wavered. She is a force of nature.  I will close with this. I strongly believe in the role of public service to create change and make a difference. Joan Claybrook's years of service reflect these values and prove that, with the right approach, change is possible. I am lucky to count Joan as a friend. It is with great pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Joan Claybrook's 80th birthday and congratulate her on an outstanding career. I hope Joan enjoys this special day, and I wish her many more wonderful years.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgS3642.txt,326,RURAL AMERICA'S CONTRIBUTIONS,2017.0,20.0,May

During that time, she served as the administrative assistant for the projections unit, and over the past several years, she expanded her responsibilities to also encompass the health systems and Medicare unit, as well as the low-income health programs and prescription drugs unit.  During her long tenure at CBO, Marion has skillfully carried out a variety of tasks--carefully checking cost estimates as she produced drafts, ensuring that timesheets were done correctly, directing callers to the appropriate person, and in general assuring that administrative matters were taken care of without a hitch. Such duties have undergone many changes over the years--from using telephones as the primary method of contact, typing tables by hand, and sending paper copies of documents, to the current approach of using email as the primary method of contact, transferring spreadsheets to the editorial staff for producing tables, and sending PDFs of documents with supplemental data posted on the web. Through all of those changes, Marion readily adapted to new technology and procedures and carried out her responsibilities with good humor, professionalism, a giving spirit, and a dedication to serving the Congress and the public.  Marion contributed to CBO's work in ways that went well beyond her administrative responsibilities. She routinely took the lead to make sure that key life events of staff--such as birthdays, weddings, and births--were celebrated, and she was often the first person others in the organization consulted when they needed assistance with planning and organizing events. In addition, her contributions to the charitable works of the agency were well-known and appreciated. Marion is extremely warm, generous, and giving--she was always there to provide support, encouragement, and someone to talk to.

To call attention to this tragic situation where thousands of people are being suppressed, where armed mobs are running around the streets intimidating people, and where Venezuelans cannot achieve the basic necessities of life, I include in the Record an article that recently appeared in The Wall Street Journal, ``The Last Battle for Democracy in Venezuela,'' and to call attention to the human rights tragedy which is occurring in South             [From The Wall Street Journal, June 23, 2017]               The Last Battle for Democracy in Venezuela  Under Nicolas Maduro, a county that had been one of Latin America's  wealthiest is having its democratic institutions shredded amid rising                          poverty and corruption                 (By David Luhnow and Jose de Cordoba)       Almost two decades after Venezuela's late president, Hugo      Chavez, came to power in an electoral landslide, his      country's transformation seems to be taking an ominous new      turn. A country that was once one of one America's wealthiest      is seeing its democratic institutions collapse, leading to      levels of disease, hunger and dysfunction more often seen in      war-torn nations than oil-rich ones.       Mr.Chavez's successor, President Nicolas Maduro, has      called for a National Constitutional Assembly to be elected      on July 30 to draft a new constitution, in which ill-defined      communal councils will take the place of Venezuela's      traditional governing institutions, such as state governments      and the opposition-dominated The new assembly      appears to be rigged to heavily represent groups that back      the government.       The Maduro government says that the new assembly will find      a peaceful way forward for[[Page H5360]]     a country enduring an economic depression and standing on the      brink of civil conflict. The government says it is building      on the legacy of Mr.Chavez, a military man who vowed to      fight corruption, dismantle the venal old political      establishment and be a voice for millions of poor      But the opposition, which is boycotting the      assembly vote, calls it a naked attempt to end democracy and      turn the country into a Cuba-style communist autocracy. The      government's own attorney general calls the vote illegal.       The 545-member assembly, a modern-day soviet, would hold      unlimited power while it writes a new governing charter,      which could take years. Meantime, the assembly is widely      expected to scrap next year's presidential elections.       ``This is the last battle for democracy in Venezuela,''      says David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane       For the U.S., the prospect of a new Cuba sitting atop      trillions of dollars of oil reserves is profoundly      unpleasant. For the past decade, Venezuela has aligned itself      with Russia, China, Iran and Whether it thrives or      implodes, Mr.Maduro's petrostate could cause far greater      headaches to the U.and Latin America than isolated      An implosion could mean bigger shipments of cocaine to      Central America and the U.S., as well as a massive increase      in the current flow of tens of thousands of refugees already      fleeing the country for the U.S., Colombia, Brazil and      elsewhere. And a consolidation of power could let Mr.Maduro      deepen his partnership with U.adversaries.       The Trump administration has criticized Mr.Maduro's plans      to change the constitution, urging ``respect for democratic      norms and processes.'' The U.has called for Venezuela to      free political prisoners, respect the opposition-controlled      congress and ``hold free and democratic elections.''       Mr.Maduro's move has aggravated Venezuela's political      crisis. The opposition, sensing a do-or-die moment, plans to      ramp up daily street protests. Some 80 people have died in      such demonstrations in the past three months, and the      president is unlikely to ease off on the tear gas, rubber      bullets and water cannons. ``Maduro's ultimate aim is to turn      Venezuela into And we will not accept being put in that      cage,'' says Julio Borges, the head of the opposition-     dominated National       Venezuela's momentous new step isn't taking place amid the      kind of revolutionary euphoria that Mr.Chavez may have      imagined before he died of cancer in 2013. Rather, it is      being pushed by an unpopular government trying to keep power      amid an economic implosion.       By year's end, Venezuela's economy will have shrunk by      nearly a third in the past four years--a plunge similar to      Cuba's after the fall of the Soviet Union, and one rarely      seen outside of conflict zones. In a nation estimated to be      sitting on as much oil as Saudi Arabia, it is common to see      poor families rummaging through garbage for food, even as the      wealthy pack nearby gourmet restaurants.       Inflation was estimated by the International Monetary Fund      at 720% this year; it is expected to surpass 2,000% next      year. Shortages are so acute that three out of four      Venezuelans lost an average of 18 pounds last year, according      to a survey by Venezuelan universities. Diseases not seen      there in decades, such as malaria, are back.       ``The government is desperate because they know the next      presidential election will be their last,'' says Cesar Miguel      Rondon, a popular radio host. When the host recently tried to      leave Venezuela on a business trip to Miami with his family,      he had his passport seized. ``I'm a hostage in my own      country,'' he said.       Amid the economic crisis and protests, the government has      headed down an increasingly authoritarian path. It has raised      the number of political prisoners over the past year to 391,      according to the Venezuelan human-rights group Foro Penal--     nearly four times the total from a year ago. Most are being      tried in military courts. And the government is seeking to      remove its rebellious attorney general through a case in the      supreme court. The government didn't answer requests for      comment.       The so-called Bolivarian revolution has become less about      ideology and more about money. Venezuelans often call it a      ``robolucion'' rather than a ``revolucion,'' using the      Spanish word for robbery. If Cuba is an ideologically      motivated communist dictatorship, Venezuela is something      different; as oil-rich as Saudi Arabia, as authoritarian as      Russia and as corrupt as       Spectacular accusations of drug trafficking and corruption      have sullied Mr.Maduro's own family.

They all say that they are innocent and accuse the U.of      trying to destabilize       In some ways, analysts say, the extent of these accusations      has made a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis more      difficult. ``The regime's connection to crime and drugs is      what makes it difficult for them to give up power,'' says      Harold Trinkunas, an expert on Venezuela at Stanford      ``Many have to be worried that if they step down,      they will be put on a plane to the U.S.''       In Cuba, the Castro dynasty has kept power despite decades      of disastrous economic policies due to devotion to the      charismatic Fidel, popular achievements such as universal      free health care, ideological loyalty to Marxism, discipline      enforced by security forces, and the nationalist frisson of      facing off against the U.In Venezuela, aside from a      similar devotion to Mr.Chavez, the glue that has held the      regime together is simpler; oil-soaked corruption on an epic      scale.

11559,topic-id,831,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, the Representative from Texas (Mr.Arrington), for highlighting this most important part of our American culture, the rural  As you mentioned, I came from a small town, like many small towns across this Nation, and we have seen our area fall into decline, but we have seen what happens when you have a tremendous rebirth in your local economy.  But there are so many parts of our great Nation in my great State of Georgia that simply don't have the opportunities that other areas do, and that is not necessarily new. It is something that we have faced in America before, and our country has always stepped up to find the right answers, to give access to success to the people in rural America and, in my case, rural  And if you think about that, we have done that in multiple ways. We have built infrastructure there that includes highways. We have built electric grids to the rural parts of our communities, telecommunications. It has been absolutely amazing to see what happens and the benefits to this Nation that come when we invest in infrastructure to rural Georgia and to rural Alabama and any other State in this great  One of the things that we have got to recognize is all of the wonderful things that we have going on that have been highlighted by our colleagues here tonight, the agricultural industry that exists, from everything like our colleague from Louisiana talked about, my colleague from Georgia, the farming communities. In our area, we have a tremendous number of cattle farmers, dairy farmers, folks who grow pine trees.  All of those things are important, but we have got to talk about enhancing that in a new direction for rural As has been talked about here tonight, a big part of that has to be new infrastructure and an information highway known as rural broadband that goes into  We have companies right now throughout this great Nation that are wanting to invest in many areas. A lot of times all they are asking us to do is to get out of the way and let the private sector take over and do it.  If we do that and we build that infrastructure but we fail to educate our children in a 21st century economy, then we have built infrastructure that will never reach its full capacity.  So not only is building broadband to the rural community so vitally important, pairing our education system to that is vitally important, too. I believe in our rural communities there is a wealth of talent, people of all backgrounds, ages, demographics that have incredible talents that are yet to be tapped into.  I believe that we can tap into those talents, and I believe that those talents can be highlighted, they can be brought out, and they can be enhanced by allowing our education systems to be adaptive, to be able to train these young people, young adults, the future of rural America, to give them the skills that they need so that they can become a competitive part of the 21st century economy.  I think that many of our States that have large metropolitan areas like we do in Georgia with Metro Atlanta have a desire to tap into this wealth of talent in this workforce that exists in rural Georgia, and I believe that it gives families a chance to stay together because it creates economic opportunities for families in rural Georgia that simply do not exist right now.  So think of a vision for rural America where we are connected with new infrastructure and information technology systems that allow the talent that we have congregated in rural Georgia, every small town across this great Nation, to be able to harness that power, to tie it back into our metropolitan centers, to create vibrant economic opportunities, let us figure out ways to harness that economic opportunity to be able to generate revenue to further enhance our school systems and enhance our communities in rural  We have incredible talent, and we need to bring that talent to the top. We need to make sure that the talent stays in rural Georgia and all of our communities, and I believe that we can do that.  We have got to make the commitment to build infrastructure across this Nation as we have in the past, and I believe the future of rural America is with rural broadband creating business and educational opportunities where we are going to harness tremendous talent and reap tremendous benefits.  Rural America is so important to the fabric of our It is so important to the people, to the leadership, to our economy, to who we are. The greatness and the freedoms that we enjoy are exemplified nowhere better than in rural  I am proud to be from rural America, I am proud to raise my family there, and I believe that the future is bright.

11687,topic-id,685,"Mr.President, in light of National Police Week, I rise today in support of our men and women serving in law enforcement.  Police week is a good time for reflection and remembrance. It is a time to honor those who serve and protect us. While we honor our dedicated law enforcement officers this week, I want, specifically, to recognize those fallen officers who have given the ultimate sacrifice--their lives--for our safety.  In Arizona we lost three officers this year: Officer Leander Frank of the Navajo Nation Police Department, Officer David Van Glasser of the Phoenix[[Page S3003]]Police Department, and Officer Darrin Reed of the Show Low Police Today we honor the memory of these fallen heroes and pledge to never forget their sacrifice.  While the work we do in Congress pales in comparison to the service of these brave men and women, it is my privilege to sponsor several pieces of legislation to support our law enforcement officers. I have joined with Senator Hatch to introduce the Rapid DNA Act, a bill that gives State and local law enforcement agencies a way to upload a suspect's DNA analysis to a Federal offender database for immediate identification. This immediate cross-hit within the Federal system will help officers at the local level to process criminals faster and more accurately.  I have also teamed up with Senator Feinstein to introduce the bipartisan Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse That legislation criminalizes the failure to report to law enforcement incidents of suspected child abuse in amateur athletics. In addition to helping prevent sexual abuse crimes, this bill will aid State and local law enforcement investigating allegations of child sexual abuse by providing them with more information faster.  I have also supported Senator Cornyn's American Law Enforcement Heroes That bill affirms a well-established practice of hiring veterans at the local level to serve as new law enforcement officers. Together, these bills will enhance law enforcement investigations and encourage better hiring practices for new law enforcement jobs.  I also want to recognize the local police officers and sheriffs in Arizona, along with those on the border who are serving on the frontlines of immigration enforcement. These men and women put their lives on the line every time they go out on patrol. For them, immigration policy is not a hypothetical exercise.  Despite the critical role these entities play in assisting their Federal partners with immigration enforcement, current Federal policy leaves them exposed to the threat of costly litigation. That is because third-party groups that oppose detention have threatened local agencies that choose to comply with valid detainer requests with lawsuits. Using punitive legal action to punish law enforcement for good-faith efforts to keep people safe is wrong. That is why a group of Arizona sheriffs came to me for help, and with their guidance, we drafted a bill requiring the Department of Homeland Security to protect State and local law enforcement entities from lawsuits that uphold valid detainer requests from This solution will enable officers to fulfill their law enforcement responsibilities without second-guessing whether or not to keep potentially dangerous criminal aliens in custody. It is a recognition that local law enforcement shouldn't be left to shoulder the burden of Washington's failure to secure our borders and to implement a workable enforcement policy.  It has been my privilege to work on this effort with the Arizona Sheriffs Association, the Western States Sheriffs' Association, the Southwest Border Sheriff's Coalition, and the Texas Border Sheriff's I want especially to thank Sheriff Mascher of Yavapai County, Sheriff Daniels of Cochise County, Sheriff Wilmot of Yuma County, and Sheriff Clark of Navajo County for their work on this bill.  To many, Police Week is an annual opportunity to recognize the service of the many selfless men and women in law enforcement, but it should also serve as a solemn reminder of the risks they take and the sacrifices they make day in and day out.

11671,topic-id,635,"Thank you, Mr. I rise to discuss the Trump administration's effort to undo the open internet order. Together we must protect net neutrality and ensure that all content on the internet receives equal treatment from broadband providers regardless of who owns the content or how deep their pockets are.  Two years ago, American consumers and businesses celebrated the FCC's landmark vote to preserve the free and open internet by reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers under title II of the Communications The vote came after the SEC received nearly 4 million public comments, the vast majority of which urged the agency to enact strong rules protecting net neutrality.  Consumers urged the Commission to protect their unfettered and affordable access to content. A wide range of advocacy organizations pressed the Commission to ensure that broadband providers couldn't pick and choose which voices and ideas would actually reach consumers. Small and large businesses alike asked that the internet remain an open marketplace where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT& The FCC responded by establishing rules that are strong, clear, and enforceable; rules that prevent broadband providers from blocking or throttling lawful online content, and rules that stop providers from charging websites for access to fast lanes.  Perhaps, most importantly, the FCC implemented these rules within the time-tested legal framework that allows the agency to respond to challenges to net neutrality that arise in the future. Following the commonsense path I have long urged, the FCC recognized that broadband access is a title II service--a classification that the DC Circuit has upheld and had previously signaled was necessary in order to establish strong rules.  The FCC's vote to implement strong net neutrality rules was an important victory for American consumers and for American business, and that victory demonstrated the overwhelming power of grassroots activism and civic participation. In 2014, millions of Americans from across the political spectrum organized to ensure that their voices were heard, and in the process, they redefined civic engagement in our country, but in the 21st century, that kind of participation requires an open internet, a place where people can freely share information and engage in meaningful public discourse.  Because of net neutrality, a handful of multibillion-dollar companies cannot bury sites offering alternative viewpoints or attempt to control how users get their information. Because of net neutrality, people from across the Nation can connect with each other, share their ideas on the internet, and organize a community effort.  I have always called net neutrality the free speech issue of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. Unrestricted public debate is vital to the functioning of our democracy. Now, perhaps more than ever, the need to preserve a free and open internet is abundantly clear. That is why I am so concerned about Chairman Pai's proposal to gut the strong net neutrality rules we fought so hard for.  Tomorrow, the FCC will vote officially to initiate a proceeding to undo the open internet order, but, importantly, American consumers and businesses will once again have an opportunity to make their voices heard. I hope the American people will contact the FCC, that they will remain engaged and willing to speak up, and that they will continue to use the internet to spread ideas, organize support, and ultimately counter the deep-pocketed ISPs and the politicians who seek to undermine net neutrality.  Two years ago, the best principles of our democracy won out. I do believe that with the same energy and determination that has gotten us this far, net neutrality supporters can garner another win for the American people.

Monday was National Police This week, we celebrate National Police Law enforcement personnel--men and women from around the country--are in Washington to share their incredible commitment, their stories of sacrifice, courage, and the work they have done to protect our communities. Indeed, they are the frontlines of protection for our communities.  These incredible men and women in Colorado and across the country put their lives on the line each and every day to keep us safe.  They put their lives on the line each and every day to keep us safe. While they don't do this work--this sacrifice, this commitment--selfishly or for credit or recognition, I think all of us in the Senate this week join together when we say that we are happy to see so many of them in the Nation's Capital for this National Police  I will never forget one time when we were out in Colorado and we were at a September 11 commemoration service. Our son Thatcher--he is 5 years old now; at the time, he was probably about 4 years old. It was just last year that we walked by a group of police officers who were there working that day. We were talking about the loss of so many first responders and law enforcement personnel and that September 11 day in 2001, so many years ago now, it seems. But I remember telling our son Thatcher--I said: Thatcher, what do we say to police officers? I was thinking his response would be, thank you. I said: You should go tell them that. You should go tell that to the police officer.  He walked up to the police officer and he got a little nervous--4 years old. I said: What do you say, Thatcher? Again, I was thinking he would say: Thank you. Instead, he looked up at the police officer and he said: You are a hero.  It kind of choked me up a little bit. I didn't say that to him; that was something that this 4 year old knew instinctively--knew from the work they had done around communities, the conversations he has been a part of. At 4 years old, he knew the work they do to protect us.  They are heroes. They show the highest amount of courage one can imagine. They run toward danger without hesitation to keep us safe and to protect our communities.  We ask an incredible amount of our law enforcement time and again. They are answering the call, whether that is a call wondering why someone hasn't moved a car for several days, a call to do a wellness check or maybe to ask why they haven't heard from an elderly relative or maybe a call because they saw a broken window and they are concerned about what is happening inside.  We call on them each and every day to protect our communities. While we honor and celebrate the men and women protecting us this week, we must also remember our fallen heroes. Their courage is unparalleled. They went to work each and every day facing risks that most of us find unimaginable, never expecting their end of watch to occur on that day.  In Colorado and across the country last year, tragedy struck far too many times. Last year, Colorado lost three men in the line of duty, three men who will never be forgotten by the people of Colorado or their families, their communities.  Earlier this week, I met with the family of one of these fallen heroes, Corporal Nate Nate Carrigan, a sheriff's deputy for Park County, was a role model in the community and someone who took great pride in protecting the people and the area he loved. The pride and love Nate's family have for the work their son did to keep his community safe is unexplainable.  We also lost a sheriff's deputy, Derek Geer, this past year in Colorado, and we lost Cody Donahue in Colorado in 2016. All of them were memorialized this week. We celebrated their lives this week, and I hope their families know and recognize that we will always hold them and their loved ones in our prayers. They will always be a part of our community's fabric, knowing each and every day we rely on them to provide our own families with protection.  Mr.President, thank you.  I yield the floor.

11691,topic-id,1793,"Mr.Speaker, it has been interesting hearing about a situation in the country--and it is amazing how some of us can look at the same thing and see very different situations. I know there are some that think we should stay in session all the time, but as is normally said back in Texas about the Texas legislature--and it applies even more so to the U.Congress--and that is, when legislature is in session, neither man nor property is safe.  We are voting on bills every day we are in session. As I understand it, there was a time when Congress could be in session, have hearings during the day, maybe vote in committee but not actually have votes on the floor during the day. But I think over the years, the concern has been if we are not voting on the floor where it is recorded, then people might not show up. There is certainly a body of evidence to support the country being better off when Congress doesn't come into session.  I had read that one of our Founders, Thomas Jefferson, for all his wisdom and his incredible draft--his was the first draft of the Declaration of Independence--Jefferson was not actually there in Philadelphia to help draft the[[Page H2936]]Constitution in 1787. But I had read that he sent a letter and remarked that if he had one thing that he could get into the Constitution--realizing, of course, it was too late at that point--but it would be a requirement that no bill could be voted on in Congress until it had been on file for a year.  Some might immediately respond: well, gee, there are so many bills that we pass as emergency bills; and I would respond that yes, and usually those things that are drafted so quickly are more problematic than other legislation that goes through a lengthy and more diligent look at what is in the bill before it is passed.  In fact, if we had such--and I am not advocating that we have this constitutional amendment--but I am noting, Mr.Speaker, the merits of having bills on file for a lengthy period of time so people have a chance to think about it, talk about it, weigh the merits, and go back to our districts and talk about the merits there.  Of course, I am not talking about going back and having these fake news townhalls where people who supported opponents demand townhalls, and they have their playbook for how you go about trying to intimidate your Member of Congress and keep intimidating until your Member of Congress becomes a coward and he is afraid not to have, or she is afraid not to have, a townhall. And then once you have cowarded them into having a townhall, then they have the playbook for how you totally disrupt the townhall.                              {time}  1715  That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about going all over your district talking to people eye-to-eye, heart-to-heart, and finding out where people are. It is incredible how people have come to be hurting over the last 8 years.  For all the talk that President Obama had about Fat Cats on Wall Street, it was as if there was a wink and a nod: Okay, I am going to refer to you guys on Wall Street as Fat Cats, but I am going to make you richer than you have ever been. I am going to stack the deck in your favor. All you have to do is endure me calling you Fat Cats, making references to you being so greedy. I may even refer to you being Republican, even though probably more of you donate to me than did my opponents. But that will be our little game. Then, of course, when I am out of office, you can pay me $400,000 for giving you an hour of my time. That is another wink and nod. It is just a friendly reward for how good I did for you while I was  Let's face it, the Democrats got through the Dodd-Frank bill that was supposed to punish the banks that brought us to the brink of ruin, but instead of punishing or reining in the investment banks on Wall Street that brought us to the brink of ruin, Dodd-Frank has overseen the demise of hundreds, even thousands of community banks that did not bring us anywhere close to the brink of economic disaster. In fact, they were the backbone.  As President George Bush was going out of office, he got $700 billion handed over to the Treasury Department so they could reward people like those at Goldman Sachs who helped bring us to the brink of desperation. In fact, I only saw one of the contracts that were drafted by the Treasury Department some years back. Lo and behold, it was one of the firms that was listed as being appropriate for the Treasury to contract with. Goldman Sachs was right in there.  Of course, with the disdain that Secretary Paulsen had for Goldman Sachs, he wasn't about to let their competitor, Lehman Brothers, survive. He was able to keep them from surviving, not helping them. God bless Ford Motor They were able to turn down any government assistance that GM and Chrysler took.  There was a remedy, if we hadn't panicked and followed the advice of former FDIC Chairman I found out from my Democratic friend Brad Sherman that he actually was the one that first brought former Chairman Isaac to the He had a good solution that would not have caused us to take what was referred to by socialists the day after it passed as the biggest step toward socialism in the last 50 years, and that was the Federal Government crawling in bed and calling the shots with the investment banks on Wall Street, much to the ruin of so many community banks.  We gave advantages to the big banks. We hurt the community banks who were not able to compete as well. God bless all of those that have hung in there. I hope that we can rectify things better than that.  The bottom line, I think, testifying about what the Obama years were about--and was even acknowledged by President Obama--a few years ago, he actually acknowledged that his Presidency oversaw a record that had never happened before in U.history. Ninety-five percent of the income in the United States--that was under Obama's policies--95 percent of all American income went to the top 1 percent in  If you were looking for one fact to really characterize the abuses of the preceding 8 years, I think that would be in contention. Ninety-five percent of the income went to the top 1 percent, not under George Bush, not under George H.Bush, not under Ronald Reagan, not under Richard Nixon, not under Dwight Eisenhower, not even under Harry Truman, but under Barack Hussein Obama's policies.  During his Presidency, the way the deck was tilted against the middle class and shrunk as the poor in America grew under Obama's policies, we actually hit a milestone in American history. Ninety-five percent of the income went to the top 1 percent income earners. That is pretty amazing.  I do personally, Mr.Speaker, think that has something to do with the Republicans gaining the majority in the House, in the Senate, and getting the Americans, by a huge margin of electoral votes, and if you look at the map, who voted for Donald Trump and who voted for Hillary Clinton, it pretty well establishes the Democratic Party as the fringe party of They won the fringes, other than some major cities here and there. They are the fringe party.  All across America--the bulk of America, when you look at the map, voted to change course. Let's try something different so that 95 percent of America's income doesn't end up in the pockets of the top 1 percent--those same 1 percent that will be paying former President Obama $400,000 for 1 hour of his time.  Where have we heard that recently?  Well, I don't believe that was George Bush speaking to the disabled veterans getting that kind of money. Oh, yes, I recall now. It was Hillary It was Bill Bill Clinton earned massive amounts for speeches while his wife was the Secretary of And, wow, all of those tens, hundreds, millions of dollars coming to the Clinton Foundation amazingly at the time that this company that ends up being controlled by the Russians are allowed by Hillary Clinton to buy 25 percent or so of our uranium production.  Let's recap briefly what the Clinton family has done for us. Well, we know that in the nineties, when it comes to foreign affairs, North Korea was a threat to the world, to freedom, because they had a crazy leader, Kim Jong-il, and the world was concerned that North Korea might get nuclear weapons.  So what happened through the Clinton administration?  Well, they sent Wendy Sherman and some other folks and they negotiated with the North Koreans and said: If you will just sign and say you are agreeing not to develop nuclear weapons, we will make sure you have everything you need to make nuclear weapons, but you will have to sign saying that when we give you everything, make sure you have everything to make nuclear weapons, you just won't make them into nuclear weapons.  I mentioned before, it reminds me of that routine Jeff Foxworthy talks about when he was not doing very well financially and a guy comes to take his car because he hasn't been able to make his payments, and he said: Look, man, please don't take my car. If you take my car, I can't do any more gigs and I can't make any money, and then I have no chance of paying you.  The guy said: Buddy, I am sorry, but my instructions were to either take the car or cash or a check.  Foxworthy said: Check? You mean I can just sign something and you will take that and leave me alone? Oh, I can give you a check. I didn't know that was going to be good enough.[[Page H2937]]  I thought about Kim Jong-il thinking: You mean you will give me everything I need to create a bunch of nuclear weapons and you will accept my signature and that is good enough for Wendy Sherman and all those other people--our Under Secretary of State under Bill Clinton?  It is amazing that she has had the nerve to come out critical of any other Secretary of State after the disaster she presided over.  Yes, he was glad to sign whatever the Clintons wanted him to sign.

11877,topic-id,2880,"Mr.Speaker, I thank all my fellow Members that are speaking up on this very important issue. I appreciate Murphy taking the lead. It is something that has not gotten enough attention. We continue to have people dying, and we need to deal with the issue.  It is interesting: some people find great hope in their religious beliefs. Throughout America's history, Christianity has been an important foundation. No, you didn't have to be a Christian to participate in government, to be a Founder, but, as Ben Franklin said, we know because he wrote out the speech in his own handwriting immediately afterwards, as requested.  So often, teachers teach that he is a Deist, as so many of the Founders, we are told, were Yet in his own words, in his own handwriting, at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, at 80 years old, 2 to 3 years away from meeting his Judge, his Maker--severe gout, arthritis, overweight, trouble getting up and down--he said these words:  ``I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth--that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid?''  Franklin said, we have been--by the way, that is obviously a reference to Jesus' comment about the sparrow, and God seeing the sparrow, watching the sparrow.  But he goes on and he makes it very clear, as his own words indicate, that unless--he said: ``We have been assured, sir, in the Sacred Writing that except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.''  Again, referencing  Those are not the words--any of them--they are not the words of a So teachers that have been miseducating people for so long, I know they are just passing on what they were taught, but there has been so much miseducation for so long.  Regardless of what else, we don't try to force our religious beliefs on anyone. That is not what the House of Representatives is for. But since it formed such an important part of our founding and a part of the discussion for most of our Nation's history, it is important to point out that those Scriptures that Ben Franklin referenced at the Constitutional Convention, the Scriptures that have been quoted so often--  We know the Bible is the number one, far and away, most quoted book in the House of Representatives and the Nothing else anywhere even close. It has brought hope to people that had no hope.  So it is interesting that, as our Nation moves further and further away from the source of so much hope for so much of our Nation's history, and for those who lived through that part of our Nation's history, the hope that Franklin Roosevelt brought to the microphone when he read the famous prayer on D-Day as American soldiers were fighting, as he said, against those forces of evil, drawn from a country that was used to peace that were fighting forces of evil.  But they had hope. That hope and prayer that Franklin Roosevelt gave over the microphone for several minutes now is condemned by so many.[[Page H5229]]That hope that served as the foundation, the building blocks for the beliefs of Sam Adams, that so many around in those days gave credit as being an important foundational building block for the revolution, for the new  We are arriving at a time when record numbers of people are dying. We heard today in our Judiciary hearing, I believe it was 144 Americans each day are dying of drug overdoses.  Who dies of a drug overdose?  People without hope, people who are drawn to drugs to provide a good, warm feeling.  We have more military members killing themselves than at any time probably in any nation's history. I don't know that for sure, but it is just hard to imagine a time in any nation's history when so many of its veterans are taking their own lives, a time when so many of our active military have taken their own lives.  Obviously, as people have said over the years, that is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and it is the act of someone without hope.  So we know, regardless of whether people accepted Christian beliefs or not, Christianity, throughout our Nation's founding, provided hope. The Bible provided hope for those who were slaves through the 1700s and 1800s. So many were Christians, and it was the Bible, it was those wonderful spirituals, it was Scripture that gave them hope to endure and get through the horrors of slavery.  Though Abraham Lincoln bragged in his early twenties about being an infidel and not believing in God, Steve Mansfield, in his book in the last 5 years or so about Lincoln's struggle with God, documents his going from being an infidel to a point where, as President, he read Scripture constantly.  Rufus Fears, a brilliant history professor at the University of Oklahoma, asked me once: You know why Lincoln's speeches are so good and touch our hearts?  And I said: I don't know. They are just really well-worded. They are great speeches.  He said: He was reading so much Scripture by that point in his life, like the Gettysburg Address, he wrote his speeches as if they were His words provided hope because he referenced Scripture so much.  And whether atheist, agnostic, Muslim, Buddhist, whatever, so many have a general knowledge of what Christians believe, and it is very basic. God, according to Genesis, the Old Testament, He created the world, created the universe, created man and woman. Basically, we got the Bible as an owner's manual, giving us important history so that we could get a good look at what works and what doesn't, and what the owner expects, and how we can live the most joyous and hopeful life even through terrible, perilous times.  Christianity goes on and, in the New Testament, points to the belief that the Old Testament, as we refer to it, points to the Messiah coming to be born in So many of the prophecies about the Messiah to come. Even if one believes Jesus was not the Messiah, incredible that He could fulfill those prophecies the way He did.  And Christians, as people of most religions understand, believe what John 3:16 says: ``For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.''  So, clearly, Christian religion is based completely on love; that God so loved the world, that he gave His only Son, who was perfect, unblemished with sins of the And only something--someone unblemished could take away the sins of the world.  And the additional exclamation point that makes clear that Christianity is a religion based on love: it was made clear by Jesus himself when He was asked by the lawyer, naturally: What's the greatest commandment?  He said: love God, and the others like it. Love each other. And on those two commands hang all the law and the prophets.  If you were to go about outlining the Ten Commandments, they easily fall under those two headings: Love God, love each other.  But then Jesus also made clear: Greater love hath no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.  And Jesus knew, because whether you believe he was the fulfillment of all the prophecies from the Old Testament or not, He could have escaped. He made no effort. He gave himself out of love.  It is easy to say He is either a liar, or He is a lunatic, or He is exactly what He said. But his acts were based on love. He gave his life for a world that needed an unblemished lamb.                              {time}  1800  With that background, Mr.Speaker--and, of course, the Supreme Court outlined it much more thoroughly in the late 1800s as it came to the conclusion well after the horrid case of Dred Scott, when the court analyzed and made clear, determined, pronounced: Even though everyone in the United States is not a Christian, this is a Christian  And everything that the Court called into view in their decision testified to that fact, as the Court pronounced.  Now, so why am I going into this?  It is because we have hit what may be as low a point as we have ever hit in When Russell Vought was being questioned, on the same day, another person named Comey was testifying here on Capitol Russell Vought was being questioned by Senators so they could determine how they wanted to vote on whether or not he could fill a role in the administration. This low point in our Nation's history has to rank down there as one of our low points.  When so much throughout our history has testified to the fact that Christianity was such an important part of our foundation, of everything that has been good in America, the ending of slavery, driven and guided by churches. Sure, there were some atheists involved. The revolution following The Great Awakening, 1730s and 1740s, ended up yielding a revolution that produced the greatest country in the history of the world by virtue of the opportunities, by virtue of the protections for freedom-loving people around the world, by virtue of, you know, the opportunities and the assets, and that a country would ultimately arise where the number one health problem for the Nation's poor was obesity. With more opportunities, more assets, more freedoms, even then Solomon's Israel--incredible country with many religions--celebrated here in the United  But as General Jay Garner was told when he was in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was driven out--he has told me twice--actually, three times has said it when I heard him speaking back in 2004. I called him. He reiterated it. He told me again in last Yes, I remember it correctly. He talked to a direct descendant of Mohammed in Iraq about what kind of government the U.should help Iraq have. I will contend we shouldn't be about nation building, but that was his order and that is what he was doing.  And he said that this descendant of Mohammed with a black turban said he was going to explain in his native tongue, because they were recording it. And then after he finished, he said: Now, let me just give you, in a nutshell, what I told you we need here for a government in We need a government formed by Iraqis, a government composed of Iraqis, and a government based on a constitution which is based on the teachings of  A descendant of Mohammed told Jay Garner that the best hope for a country was a constitution based on the teachings of Jesus, because basically those teachings of Jesus are the only way in which a nation can allow freedom of religion.  No matter which religion or agnosticism, atheism, whatever religion, it is not going to be able to truly allow freedom of religion unless it is based on the teachings of And that is what this insightful descendant of Mohammed in Iraq told retired General Jay  So we get to 2017, a hearing on the same day Comey testified, this appointee nominee by President Trump, Russell Vought, a great man, a fine man, had his Christian beliefs perverted, twisted into something that was represented to be hateful. It is a religion based on the love of God and the love of His Son that would give his life for others.  Senator Sanders said: ``Let me get to this issue that has bothered me and bothered many other people. And that is in the piece that I referred to that[[Page H5230]]you wrote for the publication called `Resurgent.' You wrote, ``Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned.''  Senator Sanders then went on and said: ``Do you believe that statement is Islamophobic?''  Mr.Vought replied: ``Absolutely not, I am a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith. That post, as I stated in the questionnaire to this committee, was to defend my alma mater, Wheaton College, a Christian school that has a statement of faith that includes the centrality of Jesus Christ for salvation, and . . . ''  Senator Sanders interrupts: ``I apologize. Forgive me, we just don't have a lot of time. Do you believe people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view?''  Mr.Vought relied: ``Again, Senator, I am a Christian, and I wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at Wheaton College.''  Senator Sanders said: ``I understand that. I don't know how many Muslims there are in Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that all those people stand condemned? What about Jew? Do they stand condemned, too?''  Mr.Vought replied: ``Senator, I'm a Christian . . . ''  Senator Sanders at this point is shouting: ``I understand you are a Christian, but this country are made of people who are not just--I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?''  Mr.Vought replied: ``Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that, as a Christian, that is how I should treat all individuals . . . ''  Senator Sanders responded: ``You think your statement that you put into that publication, they do not know God because they rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned, do you think that is respectful of other religions?''  Mr.Vought said: ``Senator, I wrote a post based on being a Christian and attending a Christian school that has a statement of faith that speaks clearly in regard to the centrality of Jesus Christ in salvation.''  Senator Sanders said: ``I would simply say, Mr.Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about.''  And that came from--the quotes came from an article in the National Review quoting from the hearing itself.  That is why I say, Mr.Speaker, this may be the low point for hope in America when a sitting Senator condemns someone who is simply quoting from the teachings of Jesus, teachings that even a descendant of Mohammed knew was helpful in creating a great nation.  We have come a long way from the hope that abounded within the founders of this country, within the hope of those who fought to bring about the end of the horrendous, hideous practice of slavery, where human beings treated brother and sister human beings with chains in bondage.  And now we come to a point that I feared--and I brought it up when hate crime legislation was discussed--that the day would come when the religion of the world based on the love of God and the love of Jesus Christ would be twisted to the point that it would be called hateful.  Jesus said: ``I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.''  He is either a liar or a lunatic or he is exactly who he said he was. But that is not hateful. It is not hateful to believe in a religion where you want to share the joy and the hope that comes from it.  One of the results, maybe it is a--not a result, but more of an unfortunate situation that exists. When you take away the hope of the Christian religion, condemn people for believing Jesus is the hope, as he said he was, or as our friend, the late Chuck Colson, pointed out: ``Our hope is not going to arrive on Air Force One.''  He believed the hope was in  And now we have someone who is declared totally inappropriate to be a government official because he believes the teachings of It is not hateful to believe the teachings of In fact, someone--I know I have Jewish friends who have said: I thought Christians blamed Jews for killing  Well, the truth is that anyone who is a true Christian, if they blame Jews or anyone else for the death of Jesus, they are not a They don't understand the belief that Jesus died for me and for anyone who has done wrong in this life.                              {time}  1815  So it is a sad day, it is a sad week, and it is a sad month to look how far we have come from the hope that was once so prevalent. Now we are in a society where suicide is rampant--144 drug overdoses a day, and that doesn't count all of the suicides by veterans and Active Duty military.  Christianity is a religion of love. May God grant wisdom to any Senator who thinks otherwise.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5228-3.txt,1801,RURAL AMERICA'S CONTRIBUTIONS,2017.0,27.0,May

11654,topic-id,877,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to share real stories of real hardships from hard-working families in my home State of Seven years ago, Americans were promised that the Affordable Care Act would make health insurance cheaper and healthcare more accessible. Well, I won't pretend to break any news here; the facts speak very much for themselves. ObamaCare is not living up to its promises. When passing the law, the other side made promises that they knew wouldn't be kept.  The irony here is that, at the end of the day, the so-called Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable. Let's look at the word ``affordable'' in the Webster dictionary. It says ``having a cost that is not too high.'' I have heard from many Iowans who tell me in no uncertain terms that they cannot afford to buy health insurance because ObamaCare is unaffordable. Ever since ObamaCare was enacted, I have received letters and calls and emails from Iowans who are frustrated about the soaring costs of their health plans.  Here is a prime example. One farmer's insurance premium went through the roof. It jumped 43 percent in 2017 from 2016. If somebody can explain how that is more affordable, I have an oceanfront property in my home county of Butler County, IA, to sell you.  Now, we have a chart here about another This constituent from Garner, IA, wrote about her financial hardships. She said:       We are going to be paying over $1,300 a month on premiums,      plus a $6,000 deductible. We don't have that much longer      before we qualify for Medicare, but my concern is that until      then, we will have to use so much of our hard-earned savings      just to pay for healthcare. My fear is that those of us in      the middle class will struggle with paying so much that it      will wipe out our retirement savings accounts.  Another constituent nearby Garner, in Buffalo, IA, wrote to me saying:       I am forced to pay $230 a month for a healthcare plan that      covers nothing until I reach $11,000 in deductible. So on top      of paying 100 percent of my medical bills anyway, now I have      to pay for insurance I can't use.  So the question is, How did we get to this point? Seven years ago, I stood right here on the Senate floor and predicted what would happen to the cost of insurance if ObamaCare passed. Let's take a walk down memory lane for a moment. Here is what I said October 2009:       And while some of the supporters of these partisan bills      may not want to tell their constituents, we all know that as      national spending on healthcare increases, American families      will bear the burden in the form of higher premiums. So, let      me be very clear. As a result of the current pending      healthcare proposals, most Americans will pay higher premiums      for health insurance.  Now, I am not I don't have a magic crystal ball, but it was easy to read the writing on the wall. I knew that layers of new taxes and, more importantly, burdensome new mandates in ObamaCare would lead us to where we find ourselves today: a broken healthcare system that is not better off than it was 7 years ago. For millions of Americans, it is much worse.  So where do we go from here? After 7 years of rapidly rising premiums, soaring deductibles, and climbing copays, Republicans are committed to fixing the damage caused by the Affordable Care Instead of joining us in an effort to fix what is broken, the other side is doing their best to scare the living daylights out of  From the way they tell it, the House bill is ``deadly.'' What is truly fatal is the death spiral the ObamaCare marketplace is in. Not only is it unaffordable for too many people, it is simply unsustainable. ObamaCare is unable to fulfill its promises to the American people. Here is what every lawmaker in Congress ought to agree on: Insurance is not worth having if patients cannot afford to use it.  The facts are very clear. A one-size-fits-all, government-run plan is driving insurers out of the exchanges, driving up premiums, driving away customers, and driving up the tab to the tax-paying public. I spoke 2 days ago about the impact of Obamacare in Next year it is possible that 94 of our 99 counties will not have insurance plans on the Obamacare exchange.  So even if you benefit from the subsidy of ObamaCare, you are not going to have an insurance company to go to. All of this because ObamaCare has overregulated, overtaxed, and oversold its promises to the American people. ObamaCare has not healed what ails the U.healthcare system. It is time to move forward.  I urge my colleagues to drop the partisan charade and join us for the good of the American people. I will continue coming to the floor to share how ObamaCare is not working for Iowans, but in the meantime, the Senate will continue working to rescue our healthcare system that is sinking under this broken law.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

11752,topic-id,902,"Mr.President, I intend to object to any unanimous consent request at the present time relating to the nomination of Steven Engel, of the District of Columbia, to be the Assistant Attorney General for the U.Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel until Mr.Engel responds to questions I posed to him in a June 12, 2017, letter concerning a May 1, 2017, opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel entitled, ``Authority of Individual Members of Congress to Conduct Oversight of the Executive Branch.''  The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Mr.Engel's nomination on June[[Page S3644]]8, 2017, and my objection is not intended to question the credentials of Mr.Engel in any way. However, at that time, no member had sufficient opportunity to pose questions to Mr.Engel concerning the May 1, 2017, OLC opinion. I believe each Member of my committee and of the Senate should have the benefit of his views on the opinion as they consider his nomination to lead the office that created it.  The opinion erroneously states that individual Members of Congress are not constitutionally authorized to conduct oversight. It creates a false distinction between oversight and what it calls ``nonoversight'' requests, and it relegates requests from individual Members for information from the Executive branch to Freedom of Information Act requests. I have written a letter to the President requesting that the OLC opinion be rescinded. The Executive branch should properly recognize that individual Members of Congress have a constitutional role in seeking information from the Executive branch and should work to voluntarily accommodate those requests.  My June 12, 2017, letter to Mr.Engel asks him several questions about the opinion, including whether the opinion met the OLC's own internal standards requiring impartial analysis, whether individual Members of Congress are ``authorized'' to seek information from the Executive branch, and what level of deference the Executive branch should provide to individual Member requests. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my remarks. I look forward to Mr.Engel's responses.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2017.     Steven Engel,     Care of the Office of Legislative Affairs, United States          Department of Justice, Washington,       Dear Mr.Engel: recently, the Committee obtained a copy of      a May 1, 2017, Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion entitled      ``Authority of Individual Members of Congress to Conduct      Oversight of the Executive Branch.'' That opinion asserts      that individual Members of Congress in fact do not have that      authority. Specifically, the opinion states, quite      remarkably, that individual Members of Congress are not      Constitutionally authorized to request information from the      Executive It further states that requests from non-     Chairmen essentially are subject to the same level of      deference as a request submitted from a private, unelected      member of the public pursuant to the Freedom of Information      Act (FOIA).       As you know, the Constitution imposes significant      responsibilities on each and every Member of Congress that      require them to make informed decisions and cast votes in the      best interests of their constituents on a vast array of      matters. Those responsibilities in many instances require      that the Members have access to Executive Branch information.      The OLC opinion did not entertain this and other key points      and did not attempt to address the significant and dangerous      implications it creates for the separation of powers,      bipartisan congressional oversight, transparency in      government, and accountability to the American people. Your      views on this opinion, its incomplete analysis, and its      highly problematic conclusions are very important for      ``individual Members'' of the United States Senate to      carefully weigh as they consider your nomination.       Thus, please respond to the following questions by June 26,      2017. Please number your answers according to their      corresponding questions.       1. Are you familiar with the May 1, 2017 OLC opinion?       2. In your view, does this opinion meet the standards      described in OLC guidance that require impartial analysis of      competing authorities or authorities that may challenge an      opinion's conclusions? If so, can you please point to the      portion of the opinion which you believe fully discusses      contrary authority or arguments for non-Chairmen's need for      information from the Executive Branch to carry out their      constitutional function?       3. Do you believe that individual Members of Congress, who      are not Chairmen of committees, are ``authorized'' to seek      information from the Executive Branch to inform their      participation in the legislative powers of Congress? Do you      believe they are authorized by the Constitution? Why or why      not? Do you believe that they are authorized by Congress? Why      or why not?       4. In your experience, what percentage of congressional      requests for information are answered by the Executive Branch      on a voluntary basis?       5. In your view, what is an appropriate reason for      withholding information requested by an individual Member of      Congress?       6. In your view, does the Executive Branch have any      Constitutional responsibility to respond to requests for      information from individual Members of Congress as part of a      process of accommodation in order to promote comity between      the branches? If not, why not?       7. Is a request from an individual, elected Member of      Congress entitled to any greater weight than a FOIA request,      given the Member's broad Constitutionally mandated      legislative responsibilities? Why or why not?       Thank you for your cooperation in this important matter.      Should you have questions, please contact DeLisa Lay of my      Committee staff.

11569,topic-id,766,"Mr.Speaker, we waste a lot of time in the House Judiciary Committee passing bills we have already passed year after year that go nowhere. But now evidence is growing that our elections were interfered with by a foreign adversary, evidence that the President and Attorney General have been less than truthful about their meetings and relationship with this foreign adversary. And other committees in this body and the Senate and at the Justice Department have launched investigations into the behavior and truthfulness of the President, his subordinates, his family; but from the House Judiciary Committee, we have heard exactly nothing, not a peep, not a hearing or a subpoena, nada, zip, nothing. Just crickets.  When I joined the Judiciary Committee, I remember hearing something about how the committee has jurisdiction over the enforcement of laws, the courts, the conduct of the executive branch, especially when it comes to law enforcement agencies like the FBI, Justice Department, activities that may or may not be criminal.  And guess what. I was right. You need look no further than the committee's website, where it proudly proclaims: ``The committee's weighty agenda has frequently placed it in a central role in American politics, most notably during its consideration of impeachment charges against Presidents of the United States in both 1974 and 1998.''  So with all due respect to the Intelligence Committee, the Oversight Committee, and our colleagues in the Senate, it is the Judiciary Committee in the House where impeachment begins. We are like the grand jury of the House of Representatives when it comes to impeachment.  Robert Mueller, the former FBI Director investigating the President, will not be able to indict him while he is President no matter what he uncovers. Most legal scholars argue a sitting President cannot be indicted in criminal court.  So it is the Judiciary Committee that will bring charges if there is evidence of ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' as provided in Article II, Section 4 of the  But here we are with evidence that the Attorney General lied to a committee of Congress about his contacts with senior Russian officials and lied on his security clearance application about contacts with Russian officials who are suspected by our government of being covert espionage operatives, with evidence that hacking and other activities, in fact, took place directed by And nothing from the Judiciary  The Attorney General publicly recused himself from any matters at the Justice Department related to the investigation of Russia contacts, but the Attorney General played a role in the firing of FBI Director James And we know now, because the President said so, that the firing of Comey, the FBI Director that was investigating him, was done because the[[Page H4653]]President said he was ``under great pressure'' from the Russia investigation. And still nothing from the Judiciary  Now, let's go back to those two dates when the Judiciary Committee says we played a central role in American politics. In 1974, we had a criminal conspiracy that involved tampering with elections that went all the way to the Oval It involved firing senior Justice Department officials who were part of the investigation. They asked the intelligence community to discredit those investigations in 1974. And there were secretly recorded conversations.  Sound familiar?  President Nixon soon resigned because he knew what was coming.  In 1998, the issue of whether the President of the United States had lied to a grand jury about an extramarital sexual encounter with a consenting adult who was a subordinate, that is what that was about. House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde of the great State of Illinois, who, as it turned out, knew a thing or two about extramarital sexual encounters with consenting adults, passed four Articles of Impeachment, along an almost exclusively party-line vote. An impeachment trial was held in the Senate, which became an epic embarrassment to the Republican Party and to this body. But now, given all of the evidence of electoral tampering, the apparent efforts to cover it up, the actions of the President and the Attorney General to deflect and derail investigations, that, to me and to others, appears to be attempts at or actual obstruction of justice.

Tomorrow the FCC will vote on a notice of proposed rulemaking, which begins the unraveling of commonsense consumer protections that enhance our online experience. Net neutrality is a concept that requires internet service providers to provide equal access to online applications and content. It prevents internet service providers from discriminating against content and content providers, discrimination that can take the form of making certain web pages, certain applications, or videos load faster or load slower than others.  Net neutrality is integral to promoting innovation, supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses, and encouraging economic growth in my home State of New Hampshire and across the entire  In March, Washington Republicans, with the support of the Trump administration, voted to take away critical online privacy protections giving ISPs the green light to collect and use a consumer's online data without the consumer's consent. So it is no surprise that what corporate ISPs want next is to remove baseline protections that allow even the softest voice to be heard or the smallest of businesses to thrive against larger competitors.  I have heard time and again from Granite Staters who call and write to my office that we must fight to protect the net neutrality rules, rules that create an even playing field and protect consumers from unfair practices.  What we are seeing here in Washington is different. At the request of big cable companies and internet service providers, the Republican-controlled FCC, led by Chairman Ajit Pai, is taking aim at commonsense consumer protections that could change the free and open internet as we know it. As rationale, Chairman Pai has claimed that since net neutrality rules went into effect 2 years ago, investments in U.broadband companies have dropped to historically low levels.  Quite the opposite has occurred. Since the rules went into effect, AT&T's share price has gone up more than 20 percent, Comcast has increased 26 percent, and several ISPs have reassured investors that net neutrality would have no impact on their broadband investments. So this is just another ``gimme'' to big cable and industry stakeholders who want to put profits ahead of customer service and consumer protections.  In New Hampshire, innovative, small businesses are the backbone of our economy, creating good jobs, stimulating economic growth, and net neutrality has been integral to their success. More than 1,000 startups, innovators, investors, and entrepreneurial support organizations from across the country, including the company Digital Muse, in New Hampshire, sent a letter to Chairman Pai urging him to protect net neutrality rules. I plan to fight to do just that.  In giving entrepreneurs a level playing field to turn an idea into a thriving business that reaches a global audience, net neutrality helps promote innovation and boost economic growth. By dismantling net neutrality rules, internet service providers will be allowed to force small service providers to pay to play online, causing instability to startups and entrepreneurs across the Nation who might not be able to afford such fees. Companies like Digital Muse should be able to compete based on the quality of their goods and services, not on their ability to pay tolls to internet service providers.  Net neutrality isn't just good for startups and entrepreneurs, it has also created a platform for traditionally underrepresented voices, including women and minorities, to be heard and, as important, to add to our economic strength. Last week, my friend Senator Cantwell and I sent a letter with several of our colleagues to Chairman Pai highlighting the importance of net neutrality to women and girls across the country. An open internet serves as a platform to elevate voices that are underrepresented or marginalized in traditional media, an experience many women in the field know all too well.  When turned away from traditional media outlets, women can turn to the internet as an autonomous platform to tell their stories in their own voices thanks to the vast array of media platforms enabled by net neutrality. Between 2007 and 2016, while the total number of business firms in America increased by 9 percent, the total number of women-owned firms increased by 45 percent, a rate five times the national average. This growth in women-owned business mirrors the emergence of the free and open internet as a platform for economic growth. Net neutrality has been essential to the growth of women-owned, innovative businesses, ensuring them the opportunity to compete with more established brands and content.  In addition to empowering women economically, an open internet has the[[Page S2993]]ability to empower all citizens civically. The National Women's March in January brought together hundreds of thousands of people to raise their voices and organize in marches across the country and around the world, largely through online activism. The Women's March and the many other marches that have followed since January demonstrate how an open internet can serve as a powerful mechanism for civic engagement and strengthening communities. The open and free internet is too powerful of a tool for civic engagement and social and economic mobility--especially for our underrepresented populations--to take away. Strong net neutrality rules are absolutely essential. They protect against content discrimination, they prevent internet toll lanes, they allow the FCC adequate room for oversight, and they require reasonable transparency from internet service providers. The rules also provide stability to our economy, to our entrepreneurs, and our innovative small businesses--enterprises that are integral to New Hampshire's and America's economic success.  I will continue fighting to ensure that our regulatory environment is one that spurs innovation, fosters economic growth, supports our small businesses, and allows the next young person with a big idea to prosper. I strongly oppose rules that would undermine net neutrality, and I hope the FCC listens throughout the comment period to concerns from Granite Staters and Americans who feel the same way.  Thank you, Mr. I see that my friend from Minnesota is here and wonder if he would like to speak to this issue as well.

11860,topic-id,1365,"Mr.Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy) for the purpose of asking the majority leader the schedule for the week to come, I want to just make a comment.  Yesterday, Mr.Speaker, this House and, indeed, the Nation was shaken by the horrific shooting in We just, unanimously, passed the majority leader's resolution. All of us are praying for the safe recovery of our friend and colleague Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others who were injured yesterday.  Steve is the majority whip and I am the minority whip, and we are, therefore, in some respects, adversaries, but we are also friends. I am keeping him, his wife, Jennifer, and their children in my thoughts today.  Mr.Speaker, as you probably know, Steve loves baseball. All of us have seen the broad smile on his face as he has taken to the field as a pinch runner in games past, wearing his University of Louisiana Ragin' Cajun jersey and scoring runs for his Republican team.  I am saddened--and I know all of us are--that we won't be able to see him on the field today running, hitting, and scoring; but, Mr.Speaker, we know that Steve is a fighter, and I am sure we will be seeing him running the bases again in next year's Congressional Baseball  Mr.Speaker, tonight, I am going to wear a T-shirt that says ``Team Scalise.'' His staff gave it to me yesterday. We took some pizza by their office and talked to each one of them. We have had good relations between our two offices. We have worked together on a lot of things and, yes, we have opposed from time to time, but we are friends.  I am also keeping in my thoughts the members of the Capitol Police, who keep us all safe. I am one of those who is blessed to have a detail because I am one of the leaders. Members of the Capitol Police are assigned specifically to try to make sure that I am safe--and, yes, those around me--as Steve's detail did yesterday, courageously and heroically.  I know the majority leader shares my view that every day that a member of the Capitol Police gets out of bed, puts[[Page H4932]]a badge in their wallet or on their chest, a gun on their hip, and leaves their home, they do so with a commitment to protect this institution, its Members, and, yes, the public who visit their House, their Senate, their We cannot say enough about our Capitol They are extraordinarily well trained, but, also, they are extraordinarily courageous and committed to serving this institution, its Members, and our country.  We are, of course, thankful for the courage and quick response of those officers who were at the ball field yesterday, and we pray for their full and speedy recovery. And we do the same for the staffer and the former staffer who were also injured in that attack.  Now, Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), my friend, with whom I also have worked in a constructive way on so many occasions for the country.  (Mr.McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his comments.  Yesterday was a long and emotional day for the people in this A cowardly act of violence was directed at our friends, our colleagues, and our democracy.  We are currently praying for all those injured and their families--Matt Mika, Zack Barth, Special Agent Crystal Griner, Special Agent David Bailey, and Majority Whip Steve These individuals are strong and, as you said, they are fighters, and they should know that they have the full love and support of this  But, Mr.Speaker, even in the face of this great evil, we saw amazing bravery yesterday. Special Agents Griner and Bailey put their lives on the line. They saved countless others. There is no other way to put it, but they are heroes. Yesterday could have ended with many deaths. They ran out in order to draw the fire away from the  This attacker moved down the third baseline to home base, where the majority of the players had been sitting in the dugout of first base, lying on the ground, and even a 10-year-old son, whom they would hover over on top of. He tried to make his movement there. Crystal had already been wounded.  But as I talked to the agents yesterday in the hospital, they said that they wished they could have even done more, having drawn the fire away and saving so many lives. We will be forever grateful for their courageous actions and those of all of our Capitol Police, who are truly the best in the business. As we end this week, I do want to take the time to thank our men and women in uniform and keep them all in our prayers for their recovery.  Yesterday I spent a large portion of the day at the hospital, yes, seeing the agents and seeing and praying for our majority whip. I have known Steve Scalise for more than 20 years. Before either of us were ever elected to any office, we got involved in politics in Young I was the national chairman, and he was the State chair of We developed a friendship, a camaraderie, and a passion for making the country better.  I know what Jennifer and the kids are going through, but our prayers are with them, and he will definitely come back and play in that baseball game.  So, Mr.Speaker, before I move on with the schedule for next week, because of everything that happened yesterday, I missed doing something important as well. I want to wish my friend, Mr.Hoyer, a belated happy birthday. I hope my friend enjoyed a nice slice of his favorite desert: pineapple upside-down cake. I do want it noted that, even on his birthday, he took the time to make sure the staff of Steve Scalise had something to eat, and they appreciated that greatly. They appreciated his visit.  Mr.Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business.

One suspension worth highlighting is H.2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, sponsored by our own Representative Glenn You may know him, Mr. This bill would expand experience-based learning opportunities and support greater collaboration between schools and employers.  Mr.Speaker, 65 percent of today's grade school kids will work in a job that is yet to be invented. It is vital we provide our students with the skills necessary to succeed in an ever-evolving workplace, and that is exactly what this bill aims to do.  Along those same lines, the House will consider H.2842, the Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act, sponsored by Representative Carlos Under this bill, employers would partner with State and local agencies in an effort to hire TANF recipients and provide them with on-the-job training.  There is no substitute for a good job, and, by passing this bill, the House will take a positive step toward getting more Americans back to work.  Lastly, Mr.Speaker, the House will consider two bills from the Natural Resources First, H.1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, sponsored by Doug This bipartisan legislation would streamline the process for removing hazardous trees, helping to lower the risk of forest fires, while ensuring a reliable electrical infrastructure.  And second, H.1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, sponsored by Representative Tom This bill provides the framework for creating a one-stop-shop permitting agency, ensuring the vital water storage projects that are so badly needed are not delayed by red tape.

11794,topic-id,328,"Mr.Speaker, the economic downturn in 2008 caused Michiganders and citizens around the country to lose their jobs, families to lose their savings, and way too many to lose their homes. Since that time, our friends on the other side of the aisle have attempted to convince the American people that Dodd-Frank was ``the answer'' to the financial crisis, despite the law failing to actually address the root cause of the downturn. In reality, Dodd-Frank has made it more difficult for hardworking taxpayers to secure a future for themselves and their children by denying them the economic recovery that they deserve.  Let's be honest: Dodd-Frank was an agenda waiting for a crisis. So many issues not related to economic stability were crammed into this flawed law that, now, big banks have gotten even bigger and small banks have disappeared at an alarming rate. Even worse, Dodd-Frank enshrined ``too big to fail'' and, frankly, put in place ``too small to save.''  Enough is enough. In order to increase economic opportunity, we must enact commonsense regulatory reform and restore accountability to Wall Street and to The House Financial Services Committee achieves this goal through a carefully crafted Financial CHOICE Act, which we are debating here today.  The Financial CHOICE Act eliminates Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all regulatory structure that has strangled community financial institutions with overly burdensome regulations that were meant for the largest banks in By enacting the CHOICE Act, community banks and credit unions can utilize their resources to help individual customers and small businesses achieve financial independence.  If we want small businesses to continue to be the engine of economic growth, we must remove the regulatory red tape that is preventing these community lenders from supporting small business job creators.  Additionally, the Financial CHOICE Act holds Wall Street accountable by imposing the toughest penalties in history. To protect consumers from financial fraud is a key goal for all of us.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4664.txt,2028,RURAL AMERICA'S CONTRIBUTIONS,2017.0,7.0,June

11681,topic-id,930,"Mr.President, we debate a lot of heavy things in the United States We make tough decisions. Decisions of the fate of our country lie in the balance. But day in and day out, sometimes we go an entire day or week without talking about the people who make America work: the entrepreneurs, the employees, the employers, the people who run the businesses, pay the taxes, and employ the citizens who make this country go.  Today, I rise to talk about two citizens from my home county, Cobb First is David David announced this week his retirement after being employed by our county for 33 years. He came to the community development department of the county 33 years ago, and 11 years later, he became the first county manager of the county and served in that position for a record 24 years. During that time, the county doubled, not just in its population, but tripled and quadrupled in its revenue. It did new and different and innovative things. As tax rates went down, productivity went up. Its popularity as a place to locate became preeminent. He is one of the shining stars in the State of Georgia today, in Cobb  I rise for a special reason to pay tribute to David Hankerson, however, because he represents something I was a part of in 1984. At the time he was being hired, I did not know him as an employee for the county; I was in the State legislature, trying to change the government for our county from an elected CEO to an appointed county manager, a professional operator of the county. That had not been done in In other parts of the country, it had been done successfully. You had continuity of leadership--someone whose job was to be a good leader, who wasn't an elected politician, someone who could do the job.  David Hankerson was hired to do that job in Cobb County, He did one of the most remarkable jobs anyone has ever done. In fact, the great testimony is that every year since he was there--24 years ago as county manager--someone has tried to hire him away from Cobb Every year he decided to stay because he once had said: I have made a commitment. As long as the commitment is returned by the community to me, I am going to stay and see it through.  On this day, as I rise on the floor of the U.Senate to pay tribute to David Hankerson, I pay tribute equally to all those who make our government work, our businesses work, our communities work, and our country work, to the men and women laboring in the fields and toiling in the vineyards, working in the shops, working in the offices who make America the great country it is today, and to the great chambers of commerce that make it happen as well.  I pay great tribute to David Hankerson and thank him for the contribution and sacrifice he made to the people of Cobb County, GA, and the State of  Mr.President, I would like to pay tribute to one other Georgian, the retiring chairman and CEO of the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce, David This is the kind of guy you really appreciate. He worked for 40 years at the Georgia Power He had 12 different titles in 40 years. He was a great employee of that company, a great member of the community of Cobb County, a great private citizen, and great personal friend of mine.  After 40 years of working there and retiring, the county had a big problem. The chamber of commerce had a scandal. It couldn't find a leader and was losing its effectiveness. David volunteered to go in as a chamber board member and spent 1 year as chamber leader. He stayed there 15 years and led the chamber to new heights unprecedented in our State and in our county: an AAA bond rating in our county, new businesses coming and relocating, and even the now-famous relocation of the Atlanta Braves from downtown Atlanta to suburban Cobb County--one of the rare moves a professional team has ever made smoothly and easily. They made it because of David  David will tell you that when the chamber board found out the Braves were interested in maybe talking about building a $750 million facility in the county, they asked David if he would stay until that was accomplished. He made the commitment to do so, and it took 3\1/2\ years--3\1/2\ long years. It was a lot of effort, all in a circuitous nature because of the popularity of the Braves and what would have happened had it gotten out as a rumor that they were coming.  David closed that deal this year. The Braves opened this season in a new stadium. With three-quarters of a billion dollar investment having been made, the county is more prosperous. David Connell made it happen.  He announced this week that he is retiring after 40 years at the power company and 15 years at the Cobb County Chamber of  I want to take a moment on the floor of the Senate to say thank you to David Connell for what he has done for our county and our community, for our citizens and our families, and how proud I am as one of his friends. I thank him for a job well done.  David, thank you. We are proud of you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of  I yield back.

I find some points of difference, which I will get into, but much to support.  I am strongly opposed to the House-passed American Health Care Act, I found that one of the sets of reasons really crystalized yesterday. The Democrats had a hearing, and we invited patients to come from around the country to talk about their healthcare experiences.  There were six witnesses in the hearing. One was a Virginian, a man named Michael Dunkley, from His story was a common one but a tough one. He has been the caretaker for his wife, who has had multiple sclerosis for many years and then got diagnosed with cancer. He talked about trying to deal with being a full-time caregiver for a wife with multiple sclerosis and dealing with cancer before the Affordable Care Act and the unsustainable cost that it led to with his family. But after the Affordable Care Act, he was able to afford coverage for himself and his wife.  We heard from a mother from Indiana whose daughter was born with Down syndrome and how the medical bills connected to her child's treatment forced her, first, to stop working because she needed to be a full-time caregiver. She described the pain of cuddling her newborn in her arms and going to the mailbox and pulling out a $64,000 bill and knowing that this is what the rest of my life is going to be like and the rest of my child's life. Then she talked about how her family got relief because of the Affordable Care  We heard from a witness who has multiple sclerosis, a woman who is now a substitute teacher. Because the State she lived in, Texas, didn't expand Medicaid, she had to move to another State because she couldn't afford health insurance to deal with a medical problem. So she chose to move to a State that had done Medicaid expansion,  We heard other stories as well. These were painful stories.

Since that decision, the Federal Court commented that a voter ID law in North Carolina didn't stop fraud.

11658,topic-id,1818,"Mr.President, I rise to speak for a few minutes on the AHCA, which is the healthcare bill that was recently passed in the  I believe the letters stand for ``anti-healthcare bill'' as there are many troublesome aspects of this bill--kicking something like 20 million people off of health insurance and compromising essential benefits. It is what I call a ``fig leaf'' preexisting condition provision, which does not provide adequate funding in order to actually protect people with preexisting conditions.  Yet what I really want to focus on today are two interrelated provisions--a massive cut to Medicaid and a massive tax cut for the wealthiest By the way, that tax cut gives a zero tax cut to anyone making less than $200,000 a year. I will talk about that in a moment.  Let's talk about the Medicaid cuts, however. This is a part of the bill that has not gotten much attention. It is $840 billion over 10 years. It will be about a 10-percent cut of Medicaid funds in It is hard to get an actual analysis of that, however, because the House bill was passed without any Congressional Budget Office analysis--none, zero. Unbelievably, the Members of the House voted for a bill that they, literally, did not know the financial effects of--how it would affect the States, how it would affect the people in their Maybe, next week, we will get that analysis. Certainly, this body will not act in that way with no Congressional Budget Office analysis.  Let's talk for a minute about who is on Medicaid, as 34 percent of the people on Medicaid are children, 20 percent are disabled people, and 18 percent are elderly. In other words, almost three-quarters--75 percent--are children, disabled, and elderly people. Many people talk about and think about Medicaid as some kind of welfare program. This is an essential lifeline for some of the most vulnerable people in our society--children, the disabled, and the elderly--75 percent--and 75 percent of the funding goes to disabled and elderly people.  The people who sponsored this bill and who are talking about it across the country talk about flexibility. Yes, there are some cuts, but we are giving the States flexibility. That is nonsense. They are giving the States flexibility to make decisions between funding programs for the elderly and programs for children, between cutting off programs for opioids and providing support for people who are disabled. That is not flexibility. That is just passing agonizing choices off to the I was a Governor, and I know about having to make these kinds of decisions. To cut this money by this huge amount--almost $1 trillion over 10 years--and act as though it can all be made up through some kind of fake flexibility is just an unspeakably cruel way to shift this burden to the  The bill talks about saving on the deficit. It saves on the deficit because $840 billion is shifted to the Let them pay it--shift and shaft. That is what it is--shift and shaft. Shift the cost and shaft the States, particularly the people in those States who depend upon these programs--those people being the disabled, the elderly, children, people with disabilities, and those who are struggling to defeat the scourge of opioids and opioid addiction.  I want to talk about some people today. I want to talk about this guy, Dan He is 28 years old and lives in a group home in Lewiston, He has autism and is nonverbal. He has some bipolar characteristics and a seizure disorder but is gentle and charming, and you can see his smile. He has very basic functional communication skills. He enjoys jumping on a trampoline and drumming. He performs all of his chores to care for himself, with prompting and guidance, such as laundry and grocery shopping. He is proud of his volunteer jobs. He serves Meals on Wheels to clients through the week, and he takes excess food from a nearby college to a local soup kitchen every  Daniel needs around-the-clock support in order to maintain this quality of life. When this level of programming was unavailable or is unavailable, he regresses and becomes aggressive. Even at current funding, Daniel is one of the lucky ones, as he is not on a waiting list. Although he qualified for services, it took him 8 years to get a home and a community-based service waiver for him to be able to live the life he does. He is in a group home in the wonderful city of Lewiston, ME, where he lives today. He is contributing. He has a decent life.  By the way, this is all about people. It really bothers me that we talk about policy and ideology and free markets and flexibility. We are talking about people. We are talking about real people whose lives are on the line--people who are struggling with opioid addiction, elderly people who have no place to go, and disabled people like Dan and like Lidia  Here is She graduated from Ararat High School in She turns 21 in That is the high school my kids went to. I had two boys graduate from that high school. When she was 4 years old, she was diagnosed with a delayed growth of myelin on her brain, and, at 15, she began having seizures and was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder. She lives with intellectual disabilities, seizures, and their side effects, as well as with a general lack of physical coordination. Yet, as her mom says, that is not who she is. She is charming and funny. Her mom calls her friendly and goofy and the stubbornest cuss.  She was never expected to read but is now on her fourth Harry Potter book. She was never expected to ride a bike, but now she does. She even has a job. After years of volunteering at a local nursing home, she was offered a part-time job and is doing well. She is doing this because she had support from She cannot cross a street by herself, and she needs to be reminded to brush her teeth. She has no sense of money or danger. On the one hand, she is 20 years old; on the other hand, she is 6 years old. In other words, like most young people, she is complicated. Everything she has achieved has been accomplished with the help of dedicated teachers and therapists and has been almost exclusively funded through special education in the public schools and by  By the way, Medicaid provides help to the tune of $26 million a year to children in Maine schools who need it. One of the amendments passed at the last minute in the House puts that funding through the schools in jeopardy. She has made monumental gains, but she will never be able to live alone.  What happens when we make these cuts? What happens to Lidia? What happens to Dan?  In the old days, they were warehoused. They were in facilities that were far away--out of sight, out of mind--or with their parents, who had to bear the burden, who themselves could not work because they had to take care of the children. These are just two people--two examples--of what we are talking about here.  Who will speak for them? Who will stand up for them?  I will, and I hope this body will. We are the last bulwark between this terrible piece of legislation that was passed in the House and these people and millions like them across the country. Who will stand up for them?  Why are we doing this? Why are we putting States through the ringer of having to make decisions to choose between Lidia and an elderly person in a nursing home and between a child and a young man who is trying to beat opioids? Why are we forcing them to make those choices?  It is because we want to give a huge tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, and I am talking about a huge tax cut. It is the most skewed tax cut in history because it only goes to a few people. Seventy-nine percent of the benefit of this tax cut goes to millionaires, which is an average tax cut of $54,000 a year. Now, $54,000 a year to multimillionaires--the top one-tenth of 1 percent, those with incomes above $6 million--would receive tax cuts of more than $250,000 a piece in 2025 under this legislation.  We are putting people like this at risk in order to have somebody buy another It is unbelievable that[[Page S2987]]this body would even consider making that tradeoff. That is what we are talking about here. Let's be very clear. It is an equation of lost Medicaid benefits, a gigantic tax cut. That is what this bill is all about. If you make between $500,000 and $1 million, you will see a $4,000 tax cut, which is not so egregious as higher up, and if you are under $200,000 a year, you get zero.  This doesn't even masquerade as a middle-class tax cut. This is one of the most inequitable, cruel, and unconscionable pieces of policymaking I have ever seen. I think we need to be clear about that. If we don't stand up for Dan, Lidia, and millions like them--old and young, living in the shadows of our society, asking for nothing more than the ability to do the slightest things we take for granted, like crossing the street, having a job, dressing, feeling they are contributing--to take that away, to force States to make those decisions--and make no mistake, they are going to have to make those decisions. You simply can't cut the amount of money that is proposed in this bill--which will expand over time, by the way--and still expect the services to be the same or better through some kind of flexibility. That is nonsense. It would be bad enough, except to do it because of a massive tax cut to the people who least need it--that is what really makes this unacceptable.  I know that people in this body are working on an alternative to the bill in the House, and I hope this can be an open process where all of us participate, where we are able to contribute ideas and amendments and thoughts. Particularly, I want us to think about the fact that we are the last line of defense. We are the last line of defense for people who can't speak up. In the case of my friend Dan, he literally can't speak up. We are who they are counting on, between us, and if it weren't for us, they would have no one to think about and demand that they be treated fairly and respectfully in the richest society on I hope we can do better.

11680,topic-id,2568,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the recent firing of FBI Director Jim Comey and Russian interference in our democracy. Jim Comey was my law school classmate, and I know that in my State he has a lot of respect from our agents and also from law enforcement in general in our  When we had the stabbing in the mall in Cloud, MN--it was just with our police chief from Cloud--it was the FBI that came in and helped at the crime scene and with other things, because for a smaller police department it is difficult to deal with something like that and because they also had work to do working with the community to calm people.  The result was a good one because of the courageous work of an off-duty police officer. While people were injured, no one was killed, and the investigation was completed.  This is just one example of the work the FBI has done when Director Comey was in charge. I think we focus very much on what goes on in this town, but there are a lot of agents and law enforcement out there who have deep respect for him.  Last week, when Director Comey was fired, I came to the floor and said that in the recent months foundational elements of our democracy--including the rule of law--have been questioned, challenged, and even undermined. Today I return to the floor with the same concern.  In the last 48 hours alone, we have learned that, in addition to sharing top secret intelligence information with Russia without checking about it ahead of time--and we know Presidents have the right to share information and declassify it, but in instances of which we are aware, the President checks with intelligence agencies ahead of time. Was this shared with an ally? This was shared with Russia, a country that 17 intelligence agencies in the United States of America established was trying to undermine our election; Russia, which was found responsible for trying to shoot down and successfully brought down a plane, killing innocent people in Ukraine; the same regime that has poisoned dissidents; the same regime that has put people to death for simply expressing an opinion that is different from Vladimir Putin's. That is the country with which the President chose to share this information.  What else happened in the last 48 hours? Well, President Trump allegedly urged Director Comey--this news dropped in the last 48 hours--to end the investigation into ties between Russia and General Flynn and to put reporters who publish classified leaks in prison. This was information I didn't know before. It happened in the last few months, of course, but it all came out in the last 48 hours.  The American people are looking to Congress for answers in the face of this assault on our democracy. It is our job to give them the answers they deserve and to right this ship. That is why I continue to call for a special prosecutor. Ever since the Attorney General had to recuse himself because of his own meetings and ties with Russia and ever since this mess kept getting messier, I have been calling for a special prosecutor. I believe that is the way to go.  Also, I have long called for an independent commission, and this is for a different purpose. As the Senate Intelligence Committee continues its bipartisan work, a special prosecutor and the FBI would get to the bottom of any criminal investigation. To me, the purpose of an independent commission would be to set the rules of the road so that this doesn't happen again and so our country can protect itself. This would be a panel of experts appointed by both sides. Their focus could well be to take these facts but to put them into a future election, as in, what do we do when campaigns get information that clearly is from a cyber attack from a foreign power?  Our Founding Fathers have said that our elections are precious and that they should be protected from foreign powers. Way back then, they were thinking of Great Now we are thinking of Next time, it could be another country. We should have some rules of the road.  It is not that long ago that--I remember when Presidential campaigns would be given some information that they weren't supposed to get from the opposing side, and they would actually return it to the opposing side. We could go back to that kind of day.  We could also have the media have some rules of the road. Look at what happened with the recent French election when there was a cyber attack there. The media didn't put out every rumor and everything they got out of that cyber attack; they showed some discretion.  Those are the kinds of things we could do with an independent commission in addition to factfinding.  I will start with this special prosecutor. The stack of reasons why we need a special prosecutor is getting higher and higher every day. Aides and surrogates of the Trump administration during both the campaign and in the transition were in contact with officials from a foreign government that was actively working to tear our democracy apart. That is pretty much established.  We know that the campaign chair for the Trump campaign had to step down because of his ties to We know that General Flynn was on the phone with the Russian Ambassador on the very day President Obama declared he wanted to expand sanctions against We also know he then lied to the Vice President of the United States about it. Those things happened during the campaign and during the transition.  Last week, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper reminded us--I was there in the Judiciary Committee--they reminded us that on the very day that President Obama imposed those sanctions, that was when General Flynn--the former National Security Advisor; the person charged with the most sensitive matters of U.national security--was contacted--the Ambassador--and then he later lied to the Vice President about that contact.  I actually asked them specifically that after the fact that Flynn knew he was on tape, that they knew that, that there was a tape of him saying one thing to the Russians and then another to a high-ranking official in America--that would be the Vice President--I asked them if that was material for blackmail. They both said definitively that it was.  Yet, when Sally Yates went to the administration twice for two formal meetings with other people--this wasn't just a little heads-up at a cocktail party; she actually went to the White House to inform them that she believed the National Security Advisor had been compromised. What happened? They let him stay on for 18 days. And 2 days in, he was on an hourlong call between Vladimir Putin and the President of the United States of  Then, of course, we have the fact that the Attorney General was forced to recuse himself from any involvement with the Russia investigation because he met with the Russian  I will note that he met with the Russian Ambassador just a few days after President Obama and President Putin had met at an international meeting. At that meeting and then publicly President Obama had said: No, I am not pulling back these sanctions. Then what happens? Jeff Sessions, who was closely affiliated with the Trump campaign, a surrogate for the campaign, goes and meets with the Russian  Because of that and some things that happened in his confirmation hearing, he has now recused himself from any matters regarding the investigation between Russia and this administration and the campaign.  In addition to the recusal, we have seen two people resign, as I noted: the campaign manager, the campaign chair, and the National Security The one thing they have in common is Russia and President  We have seen three people fired. One is Sally Yates, who was the Acting Attorney General of the United While the reasons given for her firing were, of course, related to the refugee order, in fact, she was fired on the very[[Page S2998]]same day she had gone to the White House to talk to them about General We have Preet Bharara, who was fired after saying he could stay on. He was the U.attorney in Manhattan, in a very major position to investigate these kinds of issues and crimes. And then, of course, we have Jim The one thing they all have in common is that they were all investigating various facets of this.  In fact, Director Comey, as I noted--who had gotten support and respect from law enforcement--was fired the same day Federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas to Michael Flynn's associates, just days after Comey requested more resources, according to news reports, to carry out the Russia investigation, and 2 days before he was scheduled to testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where Members of that committee were going to ask him about  Think about it. The independent government officials who are charged with getting to the truth, no matter where it leads, were fired. And the President of the United States reportedly now--and this is what we have learned in the last 48 hours, and of course we want to get to the bottom of the evidence, but according to news reports, he urged the FBI Director to end the investigation into the ties between Russia and Mike  We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of what is going on here. It is our job to get to the bottom of this. The President can't fire He can fire the Acting Attorney He can fire the FBI Director, although I think it is very important that we get to the bottom of why the FBI Director was fired and whether it was for the reasons that were given in the memo that was prepared by the Justice Department or whether it was because of what President Trump has said--that it was related to Russia--or whether was because at one point he said he wasn't doing his job, which is not what I have heard from agents on the street. The one group the President cannot fire is right here in this room. The President cannot fire the U.The President can't fire the House of He is not above the law.  This administration cannot investigate itself. We have the ongoing and important investigation led by bipartisan leaders, Senator Burr and Senator That is important and must continue. We also need a special prosecutor to look into the President's most recent conduct and all contacts between Trump campaign aides and surrogates and Russian officials during the campaign, the transition, and the administration. This prosecutor must be fair and impartial and completely unattached to either political party. Above all, this prosecutor must be comfortable speaking truth to power.  In addition to a special prosecutor, we need an independent commission. When I came back from my trip with Senator McCain and Senator Graham to Ukraine, the Baltics, and Georgia, I made it very clear--I remember speaking to my colleagues about this--that what we saw there made me even more concerned about the finding of our intelligence agencies because those countries have seen this movie over and over again where Russia has cyber attacked them. It happened in Lithuania just because they had the audacity to invite members of the Ukrainian Parliament from Crimea, who were in exile in Kiev, for their 25th anniversary, and they got hacked into. It happened in Estonia, where they moved a bronze statue out of a public square and into the cemetery with other statues of soldiers. But this was a Russian soldier. The Russians didn't like it. This was in 2007. What did they do? They shut down the internet for the entire country. This is not just a single incident involving one candidate or one political party or one election or even one country; this is something widespread. It is an attack on democracy.  That is why, when I came back from that trip, I stood with Senator Cardin and House Members Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings to stand up for a bill, which has a number of other sponsors, to create an independent, nonpartisan commission to uncover all the facts and make sure future elections and political campaigns are safeguarded from foreign interference.  For months, U.intelligence agencies--17 of them--have said that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to try to undermine our democracy. Reports show it. The facts prove it. Some $200 million dollars was spent alone on Russian TV on our own election. Much of it was passed out on the internet.  Last week, the former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, testified that Russia will continue to interfere in our election system. This is what he said:       I believe [Russia is] now emboldened to continue such      activities in the future both here and around the world, and      to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a      clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the      very foundation of our democratic political system, this      episode is it.  He said that Russia felt emboldened by what happened. What happened in the last 48 hours? We find out that he had given high-level intelligence to the Russians before we gave it to any of our allies, before we checked it out with intelligence agencies. That actually emboldens them. We find out that, in fact--because Director Comey kept such meticulous notes, we find out that allegedly the President asked him to discontinue the investigation into General What does that do? That emboldens Russia even more.  What former Director Clapper was telling us was that we need vigilance. We need oversight. We need to send a clear message that they cannot continue doing this. We do not need to embolden them.  What message does it send when the President urges the person in charge of the investigation into Russia's election interference to let it go? It is not one of vigilance in seeking the truth and fighting against a foreign adversary.  An independent commission of nonpartisan experts can get to the bottom of this and tell us how we can prevent this from happening again. They can provide recommendations to help prevent future attacks on our democracy from being successful.  In addition to a special prosecutor and independent commission, we also need our congressional committees to continue to exercise their oversight authority. Since the election, we have heard a lot about the three branches of government and our system of checks and balances. One of the fundamental jobs of Congress is to closely oversee the executive branch to ensure that the law is being properly followed and enforced. That means we need congressional committees to continue their investigation into Russian inference in our political system. We have subpoena power for that reason, and we need to use it. There are tapes. The President says there may be tapes. Of course, redact the classified information. We don't want to hurt anyone any further from what has been happening in the last few weeks. But we should see the transcripts. We should have the tapes. There is bipartisan support for turning over this material, including the memos prepared by Director  (",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS2974-3.txt,1826,,2017.0,17.0,May

11595,topic-id,318,"Mr.Speaker, this act jeopardizes American families' ability to afford health insurance.  The so-called Verify First Act would require a new verification process of an individual's Social Security number before he or she can receive any tax credit for health coverage, either under the ACA or under the disastrous House-passed TrumpCare bill.  This bill does nothing to address the reality that more than 23 million Americans would lose health insurance under the Republican healthcare legislation; nor does it address the harm caused by cutting $800 billion from Medicaid by eliminating the expansion[[Page H4879]]for moderate-income workers and by imposing per capita caps on program spending; and it does nothing to address higher premiums for older workers and discrimination against Americans with preexisting conditions that will occur under the TrumpCare bill that this legislation is amending.  Instead, this bill takes that one step further by making it harder for children, including newborns and survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking, to obtain a tax credit for purchasing their own health coverage. Under the legislation, Social Security numbers would be required before receiving a tax credit, and it prohibits the use of an individual taxpayer identification number, which those without a Social Security number use to file their tax returns.  Mr.Speaker, as has already been said, there are already protections built into the law to ensure that tax credits are issued to qualifying individuals. Under current law, eligibility for tax credits is verified when an individual applies to enroll in coverage. The eligibility is then subject to a secondary verification process that identifies ineligible individuals and terminates their coverage. This system strikes a balance between rigorously verifying eligibility, while also ensuring that eligible individuals are not subject to financial hardship because of red tape.  Mr.Speaker, this bill would make it more difficult for American families to access affordable healthcare. I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

11664,topic-id,1379,"Mr.President, I say to Senator Schatz, thank you for organizing our Senate net neutrality champions out here on the floor today so that we can all stand up and add our voices to your voice in speaking on this critical issue. Now, there are people watching the Senate floor right now by watching the live stream on c-span.org or on Facebook  They might be engaged citizens, they might be political junkies, or maybe they need something to help them to ensure that their newborn is going to go to sleep this afternoon. That is watching C-That helps the family. Let's face it. The action in this most deliberative body can sometimes feel a little slow.  Now, imagine just a few companies deciding that c-span.org will be put in a slow lane, that the public interest content streamed out to the world from this Chamber will be sent out at an even more deliberative pace, all while kitten videos get priority in an internet fast lane.  When people talk about net neutrality, that is what we are talking about. Instead of an open and free internet where the billions of clicks, likes, and links made by customer and entrepreneurs in their living rooms and offices determines who wins and loses, it will be just a few companies in a few corporate boardrooms deciding who gets into the express lane and who falls behind in an internet traffic jam.  That is why we need a true open internet. That is exactly what I heard last month when I hosted a roundtable in Boston with a number of our tech firms--Carbonite, TripAdvisor, Wayfair, iRobot, and others. Their message was clear: Net neutrality impacts businesses across the entire internet ecosystem, and the ever-changing environment of entrepreneurship can be easily disrupted without this ingredient--net neutrality.  Today, essentially every company is an internet company. Consider these statistics. In 2016, almost one-half of the venture capital funds invested in this country went toward internet-specific and software companies. That is $25 billion worth of investment.  At the same time, to meet America's insatiable demand for broadband internet, U.broadband and telecommunications industry giants invested more than $87 billion in capital expenditures in 2015. That is the highest rate of annual investment in the last 10 years. So we have hit a sweet spot. Investment in broadband and wireless technology is high, job creation is high, and venture capital investment in online startups is high. Disrupting that formula now would only create chaos and uncertainty.  With strong net neutrality protections in place, there is no problem that needs to be fixed. But the Trump administration wants to upend this hallmark of American innovation and democratization by gutting net neutrality rules. Tomorrow, Chairman Ajit Pai and the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission will vote to begin a proceeding that will allow a few powerful broadband providers to control the internet.  Now, the big broadband barons and their Republican allies say: We don't need net neutrality. They say: What we really need is a ``light touch'' regulatory framework for broadband.  But let's be clear here. When the broadband behemoths say ``light touch'' what they really mean is ``hands off''. They really want hands off of their ability to choose online winners and losers.  That is what they really want, to allow AT&T, Verizon, Charter, Comcast, and all of the other internet service providers to set up internet fast lanes for those with the deepest pockets, pushing those who can't onto a slow gravel path. Then, they will just pass any extra costs onto the consumer. What they really want is to sideline the FCC, our telecommunications cop on the beat, and to create an unregulated online ecosystem where broadband providers can stifle the development of competing services that cannot afford an internet E- No one should have to ask permission to innovate. But with fast and slow lanes, that is precisely what an entrepreneur will need to do. Right now, the essence of the internet is to innovate and test new ideas first, and if an idea then takes off, the creator can attract capital and expand.  Creating internet fast and slow lanes would flip this process on its head. Instead, an entrepreneur would first need to raise capital in order to start innovating, because she would need to pay for fast lane access to have a chance for her product to be seen and to succeed. Only those with access to deep pockets would develop anything new. Imagine the stifling of creativity if startups need massive amounts of money even to innovate.  Now, Chairman Pai says he likes net neutrality. But in reality, his proposal would eliminate the very order that established today's network neutrality rules. That is like saying you value democracy but you don't see a need for a constitution. It makes no sense.  For Chairman Pai and the ISPs, title II is a bad word. It is some terrible thing. But for everyone else--consumers, activists, and entrepreneurs--title II is a reason to celebrate. Back in 2010, the FCC attempted to put net neutrality rules in place without reclassifying under title II of the Communications The DC Circuit Court invalidated those rules. Then, in 2015, the Federal Communications Commission rightfully adopted the open internet order, which reclassified broadband under title II, and the DC Circuit upheld the rule in 2016.  The issue is settled. The FCC should not repeat past mistakes and instead should maintain the successful current regime. Why is title II appropriate? It was Congress's intent to preserve the FCC's authority to forestall threats to competition and innovation in telecommunications services, even as the technologies used to offer those services evolved over time.  Now, classifying broadband under title II is just a very fancy way of saying broadband is like telephone service. It is a basic utility that Americans rely on every day to work, to communicate, and to connect. Broadband has become the single most important telecommunications service Americans use to transmit information from one to another. This is common sense to Americans around the country, with the only exception being high-powered telecommunications lobbyists inside the beltway here in  Chairman Pai also claims that he wants internet service providers to voluntarily decide to follow net neutrality principles. That is like asking a kid to voluntarily swear not to stick his hand in the cookie jar. It just won't happen. We know the broadband industry--your cable, wireless or telecommunications provider--can't self-regulate themselves. They struggle to even show up on time to install or fix your service. Do we really trust them to resist using their internet gatekeeper role and putting their online competitors at an unfair disadvantage?[[Page S2991]]  This effort on net neutrality is just one piece of the Republicans' effort to dismantle the basic protections safeguarding American families. Instead of protecting our privacy, our healthcare, our environment, or our net neutrality, the Republicans want to give it all away to their friends and allies and big corporations.  The FCC has received more than 1 million comments already, and I am sure millions more will flow in the weeks and months to come, as the FCC comment period will stretch until at least Those are comments from every corner of the country and from every walk of life. They are standing up to say we need a truly open and free  Openness is the internet's heart. Nondiscrimination is its soul. Any infringement on either of those features undermines the spirit and intent of net neutrality.  So I proudly stand with my fellow netizens out on the Senate floor and all across America who oppose any efforts to undermine net neutrality. We are on the right side of history. I am ready for the historic fight to come.  Twelve years ago, I introduced the first net neutrality bill in the House of In the Senate, the first net neutrality bill was introduced by the Senator from Oregon, Ron This has been a long battle, a long struggle coming.

As Americans honor these men during National Police Week, we must also remember their families, friends, and fellow officers and the loved ones they left behind. May God comfort them in their time of grief and be a source of strength for them. May He also protect all those who continue to serve and to stand today in harm's way to protect our communities.

We have joined together on the floor today to give remarks and perhaps have a short colloquy about a humanitarian crisis that is unfolding before our eyes in the Middle  Today, inside the country of Yemen--a country that, frankly, not a lot of our constituents give much thought to--every 10 minutes a child under the age of 5 is dying due to preventable causes. Today, 18 million Yemeni civilians--two thirds of the entire population of this country--cannot survive without humanitarian or protection support, and 7 million of those are on what we would call a starvation diet, which means that on a daily basis they don't know where their next meal is coming from. They don't have enough food to eat in order to remain healthy. Three million have already fled their homes because of the violence that has been caused by a civil war--that both Senator Young and I will talk about--inside their country and the humanitarian catastrophe that has resulted from that civil war.  This is one of four current famines that exists in the world today. But I would argue that this particular humanitarian crisis is in some ways the most relevant to the discussions we will have here in the Senate because the United States is participating in the military campaign that is, in fact, causing in part this humanitarian crisis.  The United States is an active participant with a Saudi-led military campaign seeking to regain control of Yemen from a group called the Houthis, who overran the capital and now control large portions of the country.  We, of course, are allies of Saudi The President will be visiting Saudi Arabia very soon to solidify that alliance. But it is time we started asking some really hard questions about the conduct of the Saudi campaign inside Yemen and whether we are, in fact, helping to create a humanitarian catastrophe on the grounds that is impossible to defend on moral grounds but also is hard to defend based on national security grounds as well.  Let's be honest about what is happening here. The Saudis are deliberately trying to create a famine inside Yemen in order to essentially starve the Yemenis to the negotiating table. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman said:       Time is on our side. Being patient is in our interest. We      have the supplies and we have the logistics and high morale.      The enemy does not have supplies and funds and is impatient.      Time is on our side and we will exploit the time to serve our      interests.  What are the Saudis doing to try to exploit this question of time and supplies? First, they are coming directly after the main port city, which brings 70 percent of food into Yemen and about 80 percent of all of the oil. That port city is called  Senator Young has been very good in meetings to draw issue with what is believed to be deliberate targeting by the Saudis of the cranes and infrastructure in this port which allow for the supplies to come off of boats and move into these desperately, desperately needy areas of the country.  Second, they are requiring an additional screening process for this humanitarian aid above and beyond the one the United Nations has put into place. The United Nations is vetting supply ships coming in to Hodeidah to make sure there is really food and aid on these ships, not weapons, and it is working. But the Saudis are putting an additional process on top that is adding up to a month from the time the aid gets off the ship and into the country. Between that and the military campaign targeting the port and its infrastructure, this has essentially resulted in an effective blockade being put in and around Hodeidah, such that humanitarian support cannot effectively get into the country. But that is just the beginning.  The Saudi bombing campaign has deliberately targeted roads and bridges throughout the country, many of them in and around north There are reports that the bombers have engaged in something called double tapping, which is where you hit a humanitarian--a civilian--asset. You wait until the workers come to try to address that first strike, and then you hit it a second time to take out the civilians who have responded to the emergency. This isn't just my opinion of the situation. Representations have been made by multiple aid organizations on the ground, and, more importantly, by U.officials who have been embedded with the coalition.  This is a quote from Dafna Rand, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who was in charge of the Saudi coalition portfolio at State:       In 2015, the U.Government offered technical training on      cyber, ballistic missiles, border security, counterterrorism,      and maritime security, [and] the precision guided      munitions were transferred in 2015 on the hopes that they      would enable better and more precise targeting by the      coalition of the targets[[Page S2977]]     itself. [But instead,] what we have seen since is not an      improvement in the targeting, and the issue itself is the      target selection. It is not the precision of the target      itself, but it is the choice of targets and adherence to      the no-strike list.  That is a really important statement, a really important sentence, because what is happening is that the United States is telling the coalition: What are the civilian targets you should stay away from, so the humanitarian aid can move into the country? The coalition is deliberately ignoring that advice. It is not a matter of mistakes being made on the ground, though there have been mistakes. It is also a matter of a no-strike list being ignored.  I mention that this is not just about the millions and millions of Yemenis who are starving today because of this civil war. It is also a question of whether this is accruing to the U.national security interests. Again, I am speaking just for myself on this matter.  We are allies of the Saudis, and there is no doubt that an Iranian proxy state inside Yemen presents a threat to the Saudi There is no doubt that Houthis have been launching attacks into Saudi This is a real security threat for our allies. But we do have to acknowledge that there are other players that exist inside Yemen today. It is not just the Houthis and those Yemeni forces supported by the There is also al-Qaida--a branch of al-Qaida we know well because it has traditionally been the piece of al-Qaida that has the most advanced threats to the U.homeland--and ISIS, which is growing inside They have taken advantage of this civil war to fill in the ungovernable spaces.  Recently, with the help of the UAE, we have begun to hit back against al-Qaida and ISIS inside But for a portion of time, they controlled a sizeable amount of territory and revenue inside that country. ISIS is growing as well.  As a group of Yemeni Americans told me in my office about a year ago, to Yemenis the bombing campaign is not perceived as a Saudi bombing campaign; it is seen as a U.bombing campaign or, at the very least, a U.S.-Saudi bombing campaign.  So when responsibility inside Yemen is allotted and attributed for this starvation campaign, it is placed upon the United States, as well as on Saudi We have to think about what that means, given the fact that there is the potential for millions of Yemenis to be radicalized in a place with very sophisticated radical infrastructure. This is a real national security concern for the United  I think it is time for us to draw a hard line with this coalition and say that we will not continue to support it if there is not a real commitment made to change the way the targeting happens and to make sure that relief supplies can flow into that country to try to address this unfolding famine and humanitarian catastrophe. We can be allies with the We can be military allies with the But they have to understand and their partners need to understand that this humanitarian nightmare inside Yemen is both immoral--to participate in a campaign that perpetuates that kind of humanitarian crisis--but it also, in the end, doesn't benefit the long-term security of the United States or our partners in the coalition.  So we come down to the floor today to try to explain to our colleagues what is happening on the ground and to see if there is a bipartisan way for us to have a policy that brings significant relief to the suffering of the Yemeni people and strengthens our national security in the region.  With that, I notice Senator Young is going to say a few words, and then I think we will engage in a colloquy.

Can the Senator talk a little bit about our joint fears or his personal fears about a major new campaign on this port that brings in so much of this aid and how, in the end, that really doesn't further the goals of the coalition, the United States being amongst the partners?

11637,topic-id,201,"I thank Senator Young for making it clear in his prepared remarks that while we are focusing on the Saudis because we are part of this coalition, the Houthis do not have clean hands here either. Part of the reason humanitarian supplies have a hard time getting to places that need them is because there are roadblocks put up by the Houthis as well. And there is this known connection between the Houthis and the Iranians--sometimes, in my opinion, a bit overplayed by some foreign policy thinkers, but it is real.  To your second point in answer to my question, Senator Young, that is, to my mind, also a likely result of a deepening of the military conflict. If the Houthis had nowhere to turn, then the calculation might be different, but because the Iranians are there as a support system to lean on, a continued military campaign against Hodeidah would push them deeper into a corner and just broaden the scope of the military conflict.  There ultimately has to be a political resolution here, and by simply upping the military ante and continuing the humanitarian crisis, you get further away from that political negotiating table rather than closer to it.

I think there is nothing political about this. We all join together in trying to abate humanitarian crises and famines around the world, and we all want a policy that is going to bring an end to this civil war because, as I said, it is just as important to remember that the most immediate enemies of the United States--those terrorist groups who want to do harm to us--find their most fertile ground today inside The sooner we can put an end to this civil war and be able to have a central government structure that spreads across the scope of the country, the quicker we can all be focused on trying to eliminate the ISIS and al-Qaida presence--AQAP, as we refer to them--in Yemen from that battlespace.  I say to Senator Young, I don't know if you have closing remarks, but I appreciate your willingness to speak up and your leadership here, and I hope we can get others on both sides of the aisle to propose and support these commonsense conditions upon this new military transfer so that we can get the situation right inside  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS2974-3.txt,1837,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,17.0,May

11845,topic-id,1949,"Mr.President, I want to pick up where my colleague from Hawaii left off. There is a wonderful analogy that President Obama used after the 2016 election. As you could imagine, Democrats were pretty dejected the day after, and President Obama put it pretty simply. He said: Listen, just remember, these elections are intramural scrimmages. We put on temporary pinnies, Republicans and Democrats, but in the end, we all belong to the same team. We are all  Elections and legislative fights are temporary skirmishes before we recognize and realize our greater identity, which is that we have this commonality. Clearly, that is not what the American people see here. They think our primary identity is our partisan identity, and there is a lot of days in which we give them fodder for that belief.  It really is amazing, when it comes down to it, that when you think about the healthcare system, we do have the same goals in mind. There are actually lots of other issues on which we don't have the same goal. Republicans want to go left, and we want to go right. Republicans want to go right, and we want to go left. On healthcare, we actually all want to get to the same place: More people have access to health insurance, the cost of that insurance is less than it is today, and the quality of the care people get is better. It is funny because underneath that, it is just mechanics. It is not actually ideology. It is a decision as to which lever you press and which you don't.  I get that a lot of my Republican colleagues don't think we are sincere when we say: If you put this monstrosity of a bill aside, we will work with you to do something better. But it is sincere. We don't want to blow up We are not with you on that. We don't want to pass along big tax breaks, only going to the very wealthy. But we get that you want some more flexibility for We get that you want maybe an additional plan offered on the exchanges that doesn't have all the bells and whistles the existing plans do. But you get that we want stability in the exchanges. We want some certainty in the markets going forward.  There is an important conversation to be had here. Our hope is that, with this CBO score, maybe it will be the straw that breaks the camel's back, that will cause our Republican colleagues to give up this nonsensical approach to healthcare reform and work with us.  I am going to repeat some of the ground that has already been covered here in the next few minutes, but I want to go over some of the highlights of this CBO report.  Senator Schatz previewed this, but it is hard to get your head wrapped around what it means for 22 million people to lose insurance.  This is an old chart from the CBO score on the House bill that held that under their approach, 23 million people would lose insurance. I X'd that out. We now have 22 million people who would lose insurance under the Senate approach. That is the entire combined population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, West Virginia, and South All that happened between the House Bill and the Senate bill is that the people of Rhode Island got saved. I X'd out Rhode Island because Rhode Island has about 1 million people. About 1 million more people will have insurance under the Senate bill, but that is humanitarian catastrophe. That is a big deal, to have that many people lose insurance.  I know that is not what you set out to do. I know the Republicans didn't set out to do this, in part because I listened to Senator Cornyn come down and complain on the Senate floor relentlessly that the Affordable Care Act still left a whole bunch of people without insurance. In fact, he sent out a tweet today highlighting that the CBO does confirm that if current law continues, there will still be a lot of people without insurance. He left out the fact that the CBO says that under the Republican bill, 22 million more people will lose insurance, but that is a whole lot of people.  By the way, in the first year, CBO says 15 million people will lose insurance. Fifteen million people is the entire population of 13 That happens next year. Emergency rooms in this country cannot in 12 months absorb 15 million people losing insurance.  For all the folks who say that the ACA is in a death spiral, CBO says you are wrong. Very flatly, CBO says that if existing law remains, even without any improvements, the number of people without insurance effectively remains static. Yes, at the end, if you make no improvements, you will go from 26 million people not having insurance to 28 million people not having insurance.[[Page S3772]]  CBO says--I had to change this because it used to be 51 million under the House bill. CBO now says 49 million people will lose insurance if you actually pass the bill the Senate is going to consider this week. The death spiral happens if we pass the Republican healthcare proposal. That is not a death spiral; that is stability. It is not an optimal result, 28 million people not having insurance, but it is far preferable to 49 million people not having insurance. I understand that Republicans will quibble with CBO and say that maybe they didn't get it exactly right. Even if they were 50 percent wrong, that is still over 10 million people losing insurance. By the way, just for good measure, CBO was right in their estimates of the percentage of Americans who would have insurance under the Affordable Care Inside of their estimate--the details worked out differently--but they said that by 2016, 89 percent of Americans would have health insurance, up from 83 percent prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Guess how many people have health insurance today: 89 percent of Americans, 89 to 90 percent of  We all agree that premiums should go down. If we are going to pass something, the result should be that premiums go down. Here is what CBO says: Premiums go up and not by a little bit. They go up by 20 percent in the first year. Admittedly, I am painting a partial picture here. That is 2018. After that, CBO says for certain populations in this country, premiums will go down, but it is largely for the young, the healthy, and the wealthy.  CBO says that you will have massive premium increases for older For lower income Americans who are in that age bracket of 50 to 64, premium increases will go up by at least two times, up to four times.  CBO also says that if you are lower income, you are not going to buy insurance because you can't afford it. It doesn't even matter what your premiums are because they will be so high, you can't afford them. Premiums go up for everybody off the bat--and for lots of vulnerable people after that.  So who gets hurt? Everybody, except for the folks who are getting tax cuts. If you are an insurance company, a drug company, or you are super rich--maybe that is an unfair term--people making $200,000 or more a year get tax cuts, but most of the tax cuts go to the super rich. People making over $1 million a year will do fine. If you are an insurance company, a drug company, or you are very wealthy, you get a great deal out of this piece of legislation, but pretty much everybody else gets very badly hurt.  Today, one of our Republican colleagues said this to a reporter--I won't give you a name. One of our Republican Senate colleagues, when he was asked about the Republican healthcare proposal, said: ``I am not sure what it does. I just know it's better than ObamaCare.'' That is about as perfect an encapsulation of the Republican positioning on this bill as I can imagine, because if you did know what it did--if my Republican colleagues did get deep into the CBO report, it doesn't solve a single problem in the American healthcare system. There are big problems, such as 26 million people still don't have insurance. This bill makes it worse.  People are paying too much for insurance, especially those folks who are making middle incomes who are just outside of qualifying for the Medicaid subsidies. This bill makes it worse. Almost every problem is made worse by this piece of legislation. I guess that is sort of what a lot of Americans wonder--if our Republican colleagues do know what is in this bill. ``I am not sure what it does. I just know that it's better than ObamaCare.''  This solves one problem for It is a political problem. Republicans have said for the last 8 years that they are going to repeal the Affordable Care My Republican friends promised it in every corner of this country, at every opportunity they had, and this does solve that political problem. If you pass this bill, you can successfully claim that you have repealed the Affordable Care Act, but that is the only problem it solves. It makes almost every other problem in this system worse.  The number of people without insurance goes up. Premiums, especially for the poor, the vulnerable, go up. There is nothing in this bill that addresses the cost of healthcare, of drugs, of devices, of procedures. There is nothing in this bill that talks about the quality of healthcare. Every problem--virtually every problem in the healthcare system gets worse.  I will just end by reiterating the offer that Senator Schatz made. I think you have a lot of people of very good will who want to work with Republicans and are sincere about it. I will be part of whatever group gets put together if this bill falls apart this week.  I held an emergency hearing in New Haven, CT, on Monday, just to try to explain to people what was in the Republican Senate proposal and to get people's feedback. It was hard to sit through. It was 2\1/2\ hours of some really scared folks.  I will be honest with the Presiding Most of the people who came had disabled kids. Most of the people who came had disabled kids who were on or relied on Medicaid, and they were just scared to death about what was going to happen to their children. But they also talked about the problems that still exist in the healthcare system--the fact that drugs are too expensive. Many of them pay too much for healthcare. They wanted those problems solved, and they wanted us to work with Republicans on it.  Senator Schatz was right. If we did it together, we would own it together. It would stop being a political football. While that would be a secondary benefit to the actual good that would come from a bipartisan piece of legislation that actually addresses the issues in the underlying healthcare system, it would be a pretty remarkable good that is possible because we have the same goals in mind. We both want the same things. It is just, in the end, putting aside this bill that makes all of those problems worse and, instead, sitting down together and deciding which levers we want to push to make things better.

The community banks had nothing to do with the collapse in 2008. It was Wall Street, the people in New York, the big banks. Yet the Dodd-Frank regulation kind of let them scoot by and[[Page H4667]]gave them permits to continue operating, while many of the Main Street businesses and many of the Main Street banks have closed down.  My friend just mentioned Wells CFPB stood on the sidelines silently and mute while they were conducting their affairs. It was a county prosecutor who actually uncovered it.  So this idea that we here in Congress are going to do things that are going to get it in check simply is not true. What is true is that the agency created by Dodd-Frank, the CFPB, or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was so annoying that it put New Mexico's most sparsely populated county, with about 8 people per square mile, to be regulated the same as New York That is how much CFPB understood.  In the process of their regulating, they shut down the loans for manufactured housing. That means nothing to the people in New York, but in New Mexico, that is 50 percent of the homes in my district. The CFPB didn't much care.  They also limited the ability of regular banks to make loans on mortgages, establishing something called qualified mortgages. They simply said all balloon notes are prejudicial. Those things were hurting and penalizing the rural parts of this country.

11675,topic-id,1330,"Mr.President, I rise during Police Week to pay tribute to our police officers around the country--the men and women in blue who serve us every day in Ohio and in every State represented in this  In Ohio, this is a particularly difficult week. Here we are during Police Week, and we are, once again, mourning the loss of a police officer. This happened just last Last Friday, a gunman took two people hostage in the woods behind a nursing home in Kirkersville, OH, which is a small town about 25 miles east of  The first one to arrive on the scene was the police chief of this small town. His name was Steven Chief Steven DiSario confronted the assailant, and he was ambushed by this assailant. He was shot. He was killed. This gunman then went inside the nursing facility, and he murdered two staff members--a registered nurse, Marlina Medrano, and a nurse's aide named Cindy Then he took his own life.  By the way, Police Chief Steven DiSario was 36 years old and had just become the police chief in Kirkersville a month ago. The women who were slain were Marlina Medrano, who had a son, and Cindy Krantz, who had five kids, including a 10-year-old son. Those kids had to spend Mother's Day preparing for their moms' burials.  On Monday, I went to Kirkersville and saw the memorial there for the officer. I also had an opportunity to meet with some of the officers who were from neighboring communities. There was just one police officer in Kirkersville--just the chief. I was able to express to them the sympathy and the gratitude of the people throughout I had brought a flag that had been flown over the U.Capitol in honor of Chief DiSario, and that flag will go to his family as a very small token of the appreciation and gratitude of all of us for their father's and husband's service.  Chief DiSario had six kids, and his widow, Aryn, is currently pregnant with their seventh child--a child who is never going to know his or her dad. What he or she will know is that he died a hero, that he died a hero in risking his life to protect innocent people.  That is what police officers do every single day. They keep us safe. They take dangerous criminals and weapons and drugs off our streets. They enforce the law. Even their very presence helps to deter crime and keep our communities safer, but they do it all at great risk--at great risk to themselves and at great sacrifice to their families.  A little more than a year ago, I did a ride-along in Columbus with Officer Greg He is one of those brave Columbus police officers who goes out every day to help keep our communities safe, and we were focused on a couple of issues that night in  One was the drug trade, particularly the opioid crisis we face in He was able to show me where much of this activity occurs, and we were able to see with our eyes some of the people who were trafficking drugs, dispersing, and what goes on in our communities.  We were also talking about human trafficking and his work in that area. We were able to go to some particular places at which there had been trafficking in the past and where the police had broken up trafficking rings in which girls and women had been made to become dependent on heroin. Then the traffickers had them, often in a hotel for a week until they had moved on to another one and trafficked--sold--human beings, usually online, usually through the iAgain, this police officer was able to tell me about what he has done and what his force has done to help protect these girls and women and to help get them out of that situation.  This was just a few hours for me, and I always enjoy doing these ride-alongs, but this is his life and their lives every day. They are out there doing their best to try to protect us and to make our communities safer.  The day before this tragedy occurred in Kirkersville, we had had a lot of police officers here in town because, on Thursday and Friday and over the weekend, police officers had been coming in for Police Week and Police Memorial Day, which was on Monday, so I had a chance to meet with a bunch of these officers and thank them for their service.  We talked about the fact that the job is dangerous and increasingly dangerous. Unfortunately, the numbers show that. Little did we know that, the day after we had been talking, there would have again been this tragedy in We talked about the fact that some of their families have had sleepless nights because they do not know whether their husbands or their wives or their sons or daughters are going to be coming home.  In our Nation's history, more than 21,000 police officers have died in the line of duty. Think about that--21,000. We have already had 42 this year, 2017. In 2016, we lost 143, which is about one officer every 3 days. Again, last year, five of those fallen officers were from Ohio: Aaron Christian, a patrolman with the Chesapeake Police Department; Thomas Cottrell, a patrolman[[Page S2995]]with the Danville Police Department; Sean Johnson, of the Hilliard, OH, Division of Police; Steven Smith, of the Columbus Division of Police; and Kenneth Velez, an Ohio State trooper.  I had the opportunity to meet with some of the families of these fallen officers to express our appreciation, to express our respect for them and the sacrifices that they bear. It takes courage to wear the badge, and those officers wear the badge day in and day out. They knew what they were getting into. Yet they wore that badge; they died wearing that badge.  Although these heroic men were taken from us, their examples can never be taken away and will not be. Ohioans are going to remember them as models of bravery and service, as examples of fellow citizens who, on behalf of all of us, were in the habit of walking into danger rather than running away from it.  We have an opportunity to do something that will make a difference for our police officers by supporting the Police Week resolution that the House and the Senate are working on. I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I am sure they will. I think we need to show our men and women in blue, who are on the frontlines, that we do appreciate them.  There is also legislation that can be supported. Most recently, with the majority whip, I introduced legislation that is called the Back the Blue It is very simple. It says, if you target law enforcement officers, you are going to have to pay a very high price. That is appropriate. We think the Back the Blue Act, which would increase penalties on those who would attempt to harm or kill a police officer, is going to make a difference because it will send a strong message and help deter some of these crimes. Ultimately, I think that it will make our heroes in blue safer and help save lives.  Again, I urge my colleagues to join me in the wake of this terrible tragedy we had in central I know the people of Ohio are looking for Congress to stand tall and to stand with our police officers and to thank them for what they do to protect us every day.  Let's support this Police Week resolution. Let's support the Back the Blue Let's do everything we can to ensure that our police officers know that we are with them--that we are at their side--as they do their job every day to protect us.

The bill (717) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:                                 717       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Pro bono Work to Empower and      Represent Act of 2017'' or the ``POWER Act''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Extremely high rates of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault, and stalking exist at the local,      State, and national levels and such violence or behavior      harms the most vulnerable members of our society.       (2) According to a study commissioned by the Department of      Justice, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic      violence during their lifetime.       (3) Proactive efforts should be made available in all      forums to provide pro bono legal services and eliminate the      violence that destroys lives and shatters families.       (4) A variety of factors cause domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and a variety of      solutions at the local, State, and national levels are      necessary to combat such violence or behavior.       (5) According to the National Network to End Domestic      Violence, which conducted a census including almost 1,700      assistance programs, over the course of 1 day in September      2014, more than 10,000 requests for services, including legal      representation, were not met.       (6) Pro bono assistance can help fill this need by      providing not only legal representation, but also access to      emergency shelter, transportation, and childcare.       (7) Research and studies have demonstrated that the      provision of legal assistance to victims of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking      reduces the probability of such violence or behavior      reoccurring in the future and can help survivors move      forward.       (8) Legal representation increases the possibility of      successfully obtaining a protective order against an      attacker, which prevents further mental and physical injury      to a victim and his or her family, as demonstrated by a study      that found that 83 percent of victims represented by an      attorney were able to obtain a protective order, whereas only      32 percent of victims without an attorney were able to do so.       (9) The American Bar Association Model Rules include      commentary stating that ``every lawyer, regardless of      professional prominence or professional workload, has a      responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to      pay, and personal involvement in the problems of the      disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding experiences in      the life of a lawyer''.       (10) As representatives of the Department of Justice, the      duty of United States Attorneys is to present ``equal and      impartial justice to all its citizens'', which should      include, especially, survivors of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault, and stalking who might not      otherwise know how to seek advice and protection.       (11) As Federal leaders who have knowledge of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in      their localities, United States Attorneys should encourage      lawyers to provide pro bono resources in an effort to help      victims of such violence or behavior escape the cycle of      abuse.       (12) A dedicated army of pro bono attorneys focused on this      mission will inspire others to devote efforts to this cause      and will raise awareness of the scourge of domestic violence,      dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking throughout the      country.       (13) Communities, by providing awareness of pro bono legal      services and assistance to survivors of domestic violence,      dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, will empower      those survivors to move forward with their lives.     3.

11607,topic-id,233,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2581, the Verify First Act, introduced by my good friend and colleague, Congressman Lou This legislation seeks to remedy one of the many oversights of the ACA that it failed to address--an oversight at the expense of the American taxpayer.  Under the current system, the Treasury disburses credits to individuals before their application has been verified. In the real world, where I come from, that just doesn't happen. If the IRS then finds out that this individual is not eligible, they have to try to get the money back. It is almost impossible to recover that money.  This legislation closes a loophole simply by requiring an individual be verified as lawfully present before the Treasury releases the money. It is important to understand that the issue at hand is about poor stewardship of hard-earned tax dollars. That is what the American people sent us down here for. The sole intent of this credit was for the credits to be used lawfully, and this legislation helps ensure just that.  At a time when our national debt is $19 trillion and counting, it makes no sense for the Federal Government to continue to write these checks.

In all, nearly 20 percent of Alabama's community banks have either closed or been forced to merge under Dodd- Why is this happening? Because homegrown banks can't keep up with the crazy compliance costs that Dodd-Frank mandates.

Many Americans may not have one insurance provider on the exchange this fall.  Forty percent of counties in the country now only have one option on the exchange. The ACA Medicaid expansion treats nonelderly, nondisabled individuals living above the poverty line more favorably than the elderly and disabled that this crucial program exists to protect.  Seven years ago, President Obama and congressional Democrats ran through an ill-conceived and unsustainable healthcare law that was grounded in make-believe and statements that were just not true. The Supreme Court twisted an unconstitutional individual mandate penalty into a dubiously constitutional tax, not only mocking our Constitution, but facilitating an evasion of responsibility for representatives who imposed an unpopular tax on the American people.  The legacy ObamaCare has been and will continue to be--lost plans, lost doctors, and, as Chelsea Clinton reminded us last year, crushing costs. Single payer is not to the option. Not one Senator voted for single payer yesterday.  The solution to our healthcare problem is more freedom, more choice, less Washington control.

11685,topic-id,1553,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak about an emerging crisis in our hemisphere in the nation of It has been covered extensively in the press. I wanted to come today with an update and a suggestion, a request of the administration about a step we can take.  First of all, I am very pleased that today our Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, scheduled a discussion at the U.Security Council with regard to It was not an open press discussion. Again, it showed extraordinary leadership, and I thank her for her work and for doing so. This deserves attention.  By the way, Venezuela is a country that is blessed with natural resources. It was once Latin America's richest country, but today the people of Venezuela are literally starving, its financial system has collapsed, and there are, as you have seen from the press reports, massive protests in the streets. Its once proud democracy is now in the hands of a dictator, Nicolas Maduro, and his cronies and thugs, who have plunged that nation into a constitutional crisis. They are using violence and bloodshed to suppress and silence citizens speaking out against the regime's corruption and its abuse of political prisoners.  What the people of Venezuela are calling for is pretty straightforward: free and fair elections as called for under the Constitution of that country, a return to representative democracy--the democracy they once had. They are paying for these requests with their blood and even their lives. According to the most recent reports, dozens of people have been killed, including teenagers. The Washington Post reported yesterday the recent deaths of 18-year-old Luis Alviarez, who was killed by a bullet to the chest, and 17-year-old Yeison Mora Cordero, who died from a bullet to the head.  There were two reports today in the press of great interest, one from the New York Times and one from the Washington Both documented the plight of members of the national guard who have been tasked with the job of suppressing the protests in the street. The gist of the articles was this: These people who are putting on these uniforms--they didn't sign up for this. They signed up for security. They signed up to protect the people of Venezuela, not to oppress them.  They, too, are suffering from poor food. There was one article that said that basically breakfast in the morning for the national guard in Venezuela consists of a boiled carrot or a potato, and then they are sent to the streets for hours. Then they come back and maybe have an arepa, which is a corn cake, and, if they are lucky, some butter. They, too, are suffering from this.  Here is the most enlightening part of this: A lot of their family members--their mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, loved ones, husbands, wives, girlfriends, and boyfriends--are on the other side of the protest lines. Their fellow Venezuelans are on the other side, and they are being tasked to do this.  I just say to them: Remember what your oath was. To the members of the national guard in Venezuela, remember that your job is to protect the people of Venezuela, not to oppress them.  Beyond what we see there--the innocent people dying because of the dictatorship trampling the will of the people and destroying their democratic institutions--one of the specific things that Maduro has done to become a dictator is he has undercut and frankly tried to wipe out the authority of their National Assembly, which is their unicameral legislative body. The way he has done that is by highjacking the supreme court of the country, and they call it the Supreme Tribunal of It is packed with puppets who do his bidding. As an example, these puppets recently ruled that they would rescind the democratic powers vested to the elected members of the National Assembly by the constitution of that country. In essence, they ruled that the National Assembly no longer had legislative authority. The protests were so massive, even within the government, that they had to backtrack from that ruling.  Here is what is interesting. This is a recent opinion piece written by Francis Toro and Pedro Rosas in the Washington Post which said it best: ``Beware Maikel Moreno, the hatchet man who runs Venezuela's supreme court.''  Here is what they wrote:       Moreno, a former intelligence agent, was tried and      convicted of murder in 1987, though the corroborating      documents from the court system are no longer available. . .      . He spent just two years in jail before being released. He      was then immediately implicated in a second killing, in 1989,      for which he was charged but never tried.  He was a loyalist of Hugo Chavez, and he became a judge in the early 2000s. His ``career as a judge hit a snag in 2007,'' Toro and Rosas note, ``when he was removed from the bench for `grave and inexcusable' errors after releasing two murder suspects against orders from the Supreme The government handed him a new job as a diplomat abroad. After a few years out of sight, he was appointed a supreme court justice in 2014.''  Then in 2017, Moreno--not once but twice a killer--was appointed the chief justice of Venezuela's supreme court. The Venezuelan supreme court is run by a murderer. Think about that. A convicted criminal is presiding over Venezuela's supreme court. So it is no wonder that the court's members have acted as a rubberstamp for Maduro's illegitimate power grab, and they have created a political and a humanitarian crisis.  Venezuelans, as I said, are struggling to get basic goods, like food and medicine, and access to basic services. The Wall Street Journal reported that Venezuelans have lost, on average, 19[[Page S3002]]pounds in the last year--not due to some incredible new diet, but due to the country's food crisis. This is staggering. It is appalling. It is unconscionable. It cannot be tolerated.  The Venezuelan people deserve a return to democracy. They deserve a government that respects the rule of law and the constitution.  I believe it is the responsibility and the duty of the nations of the Western Hemisphere, including our Nation, to help the Venezuelan people. Article 20 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter states:       In the event of an unconstitutional alteration of the      constitutional regime that seriously impairs the democratic      order in a member state, any member state or the Secretary      General may request the immediate convocation of the      Permanent Council to undertake a collective assessment of the      situation and to take such decisions as it deems appropriate.  This is what must be done because if we fail to help the Venezuelan people in their time of need and if the worst comes to pass, what will follow will not be confined to the Venezuelan borders.  The United States as a result, I hope, should impose sanctions against corrupt individuals--not the government, not the people; individuals--responsible for human rights violations, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, undermining the country's democratic process. President Obama began that process. President Trump actually sanctioned some additional people earlier this year, including the kingpin drug dealer who is now the Vice President of Venezuela, Tareck El  Here are some people who should be sanctioned by the current He should target for sanctions Chavista officials within the judiciary--all of these magistrates who have enabled Maduro's takeover. That includes the murderer who is the chief justice of their supreme court, Maikel Jose Moreno Perez, and others like him who are part of that so-called constitutional group within the supreme court of Venezuela, many of whom have access to money and use visas to travel freely within the United Among these names are Calixto Ortega, Arcadio Delgado, Federico Fuenmayor, Carmen Zuleta, Lourdes Suarez Anderson, and Juan Jose These are the people who have helped in this coup d'etat that has canceled the democratic order in Venezuela, and they should be punished for what they have done.  I will close by pointing to two things that are of deep concern. The first is this report today in El Nuevo Herald in Miami, which basically cites that Maduro has now ordered the militarization of a border region with We are concerned about that because we have always feared he would create some sort of a military pretext to distract people from the crisis within the country.  Then there is this unusual behavior on the part of For example, yesterday he said that the Chavistas--the followers of Hugo Chavez--are the new Jews of the 21st century. Basically he is comparing the Chavistas with the Jews who were exterminated during the Holocaust in World War These comments were broadcast on state television last night. It is incredible.  By the way, this is the same man who about a week ago was caught on camera, with a straight face, asking a cow to vote for a constitutional referendum he is seeking to pass. I don't even think the cow would support him at this point in  Mr.President, I hope President Trump in the next few days or weeks will act against these individuals who have carried out this coup d'etat against democracy in Venezuela and have plunged this proud nation and proud people into a constitutional, humanitarian, and economic crisis.

I don't know if everyone on the other side of the aisle knows this, but there are already measures in place to prevent advanced premium tax credits from going to ineligible people. There is already a mechanism in place for Treasury to reconcile tax credits, and any undocumented individual found to have received a subsidy must repay them in full.  The other side will also try to make the argument that this measure will help fight fraud in the healthcare system, that there is somehow overwhelming amounts of evidence that immigrants are the main perpetrators of fraud. Beneficiaries struggling to access care are not the perpetrators of fraud. These are good people trying to do right by their families and by their country.  Of course, my colleagues over there are going to cite a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report, written by a Republican majority, that found, ``a half a million illegal immigrants received $750 million in healthcare subsidies.''

What the report says is 500,000 individuals, and not 500,000 undocumented individuals or any other term that Republicans like to use to disparage immigrants.                              {time}  1345  There is no evidence to suggest that immigrants without authorization to be here would take the risk of signing on to a government website to fraudulently get healthcare coverage.  So what are the unintended consequences of this bill?  I hate to break it to my colleagues, but the people most impacted are U.citizens who were born abroad or naturalized, not undocumented individuals.  This bill is yet another example that the Republican majority will do anything to demonize even the smallest subsection of immigrants in order to gut healthcare for Americans and get their billionaire buddies a big, fat tax break. Whether that means sowing fear in communities by raiding homes in order to hunt people down or denying access to care for legal immigrants who are entitled to care, no excuse is too ridiculous for Republicans to attack the immigrant community.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by 226 organizations in opposition to H.2581.                                                    June 12, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: As national, state, and local      organizations concerned about immigrant rights or access to      affordable health care, we are writing to strongly urge you      to VOTE NO on HR 2581, the ``Verify First'' This bill is      an attack on people's ability to see a doctor and on      immigrants and people of color. It is not the ``common      sense'' taxpayer protection bill that its supporters would      have you believe.       HR 2581 is a dangerous bill that puts up roadblocks for      both citizens and immigrants to obtain timely, affordable      health insurance. It would strip away provisions that provide      for a person to obtain subsidies for enrollment in an      Affordable Care Act (or the contemplated American Health Care      Act) plan while they work with Department of Health and Human      Services to verify their U.citizenship or immigration      status. The people most impacted are U.citizens who were      born abroad or naturalized. The bill also affects many      immigrants, especially those newly arrived or certain victims      of domestic violence and trafficking survivors.       The fact is that when individuals are not able to      immediately verify their citizenship or immigration status on      an Affordable Care Act Marketplace, it begins an often months      long, strenuous process of sending in documents that must be      physically inspected. Health care assisters routinely say      these clients are the hardest cases they work on because the      process for verifying citizenship and immigration status is a      time-consuming exercise in dealing with inefficient      government processes.       Rather than protect American taxpayers, HR 2581 would strip      from American taxpayers important protections that are needed      to overcome deficiencies in federal government databases.      Immigrants who are not lawfully present are categorically      barred from enrollment in health insurance on the Affordable      Care Act marketplaces, and for the subsidies that make that      insurance affordable. Moreover, safeguards protecting      taxpayers are already built into the ACA; individuals whose      citizenship or immigration status cannot be verified already      are required to pay back all of their subsidies when they      file their taxes and ``reconcile'' their premium tax credits.       Supporters of this bill cite a sloppy Senate Homeland      Security and Government Affairs Committee report that arrived      at a made-up number of supposed ``fraud.'' It's just not      true. The committee assumed that every person who lost      coverage for failure to verify their citizenship and      immigration status was undocumented. In the experience of our      organizations and organizations we work with, this is false.      These reports describe the first year of the marketplaces,      and it is well documented that system outages and      understaffing, among other technical problems, contributed to      the federal Marketplace's failure to verify consumers' status      promptly. The Department of Health and Human Services      Inspector General reported in 2014 that a cause of the delay      in verification was the agency's lack of prioritization of      this issue.       Despite huge gains since then, problems still persist. The      Social Security database holding many citizens' information      may not reflect common changes, such as when a person marries      and changes their last name, or when someone naturalizes and      gains U.citizenship. People lose their coverage because      they receive notices in languages they cannot read.      Immigrants are required to submit documents multiple times,      or wait while the Department of Homeland Security finds paper      files, a result of deficiencies in their databases affecting      groups like asylum applicants and some survivors of domestic      violence. These are among the many issues consumers face.       Congress has already deprived undocumented immigrants from      the ability to buy coverage, even at full price, so they can      see a doctor when they are sick, but this bill would go a      step further to delay or put out of reach affordable health      insurance for many citizens and lawfully present immigrants.      Our organizations firmly believe that this would be      detrimental to the people we represent and to all of our      communities as a whole. We have seen that when health      insurance is unaffordable, people are effectively prevented      from obtaining access to the care they need to be healthy.       This bill is not just an attack on our health care system,      it is also an attack on immigrants and people of color, which      our organizations stand firmly against. In his statements      when introducing this bill, Lou Barletta focused the      bill as part of his effort to ``stop illegal immigration.''      Barletta has a long history of anti-immigrant rhetoric,      from trying to prevent immigrants from leasing a residence to      stating that they should be denied life-saving services in      hospital emergency rooms. This bill is simply a vehicle for      scapegoating immigrants and people of color and will keep      eligible people from accessing health care.       We the undersigned organizations urge you to vote NO on HR      2581 and the continued assault on immigrants and the health      of our communities.

11609,topic-id,484,"Mr.Speaker, I was addressing a racist piece of legislation that was used to buy a vote for the TrumpCare bill. But the problem is that this bill doesn't do anything that it says it does. It is based on a blatantly partisan Senate report that doesn't even say what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that it says.  It is baffling how many of my Republican colleagues believe that this report that they keep citing actually said anything about undocumented immigrants. Did you ``read'' this report in the same way that you ``read'' the AHCA and all of its amendments?  If you actually read the report, you would know that it does not state that these individuals were undocumented immigrants, but only that they did not complete the verification process. The hurdles might have been too big, it might have taken too much time or too much effort, and they dropped out of the verification process without completing it.  The report also doesn't say that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants enrolled and received premium credits. The report states that ``as of September 30, 2015, CMS awarded approximately $750 million in advance premium tax credits to individuals enrolled through healthcare.gov who CMS later determined to be ineligible. . . .''  It is funny that the daughter of Mexican American immigrants is able to read and understand the distinctions made in this report better than some of my native-born colleagues can.  Mr.Speaker, I want to close by begging my Republican colleagues to prove to me that this bill isn't about shutting out immigrants from access to care: legal immigrants or children of those born overseas to our military or newborn children or victims of domestic violence or victims of human trafficking.  Prove to me that you care about the health and wellbeing of all Americans, regardless of the color of their skin or their economic circumstances.  I am actually in agreement with you that ineligible individuals should not see a single penny of the subsidies provided by both the ACA and the AHCA, but there are protections already in place where only citizens and people lawfully present in the United States can enroll in marketplace coverage and get subsidies to help them pay their premiums and cost-sharing charges.  This bill doesn't fix anything. It just seeks to further demonize immigrants as criminals and people with my last name out of the healthcare system.  Instead of wasting our time on a bill that is in search of a problem to solve, a problem that doesn't even exist, let's work together to make sure that other Americans are not caught up in the unintended consequences of this bill and aren't denied coverage when they are actually eligible for those subsidies and that coverage.

11613,topic-id,605,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill.  If adopted, the Verify First Act will proceed to final passage as amended.  The Democratic motion to recommit simply amends the Verify First Act to ensure that our most vulnerable--newborns and infants--do not experience a delay in health coverage.  We know that the citizenship of newborns can't be verified electronically because they don't have Social Security numbers yet when they are born. In order to verify their child's status, parents have to send a copy of their child's birth certificate, which can take anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks to obtain, depending on the State, and that is the best-case scenario if the parents throw a perfect game in documenting and planning for the arrival of their newborn. Just like any perfect game, a little luck is involved in that.  That luck includes having the Social Security Administration process your child's Social Security number as soon as they receive it, that the Administration doesn't make a mistake in the spelling of your child's name, and that you have the financial resources and education to know exactly what steps you need to take to ensure that your newborn has coverage the moment they come out of your womb.  When most people are anticipating the birth of a child, that is not what they are thinking about. The birth of a child is one of life's most precious moments. The joy you feel when you hold your child for the first time should be the only feeling going through your mind. Filling the paperwork out to ensure that your child is covered shouldn't even be something that you should have to worry about.  But the Verify First Act, as currently drafted, would give you another thing to worry about and add an unnecessary barrier for newborns to receive the care they need. God forbid if your child needs extra care after they are born but doesn't have coverage because your plan is waiting to verify your child's status.  A child's life should not hang in the balance because of paperwork and red tape. For all the claims that Republicans are the pro-life party, they sure know how to make life difficult for a newborn as soon as they are out of the womb. They claim to protect the lives of the unborn and crusade against lifesaving institutions such as Planned But where are their morals and love of life after the child is born? It somehow magically disappears, and they will throw every obstacle up to ensure that newborns don't receive the care that they need and that they are entitled to.  Whether it is through the unintended consequences of a poorly drafted bill such as this one, or gutting the program that covers half the births in the U.S., Republicans will do everything to gut access to care or place obstacles in struggling people's paths. That's right, by cutting over $800 billion out of Medicaid, Republicans are endangering the health and welfare of all newborn children.  Earlier I asked my Republican colleagues to prove to me that they care about the health and well-being of all Americans regardless of the color of their skin or their economic circumstances. Well, I am asking them now to prove to me that they care about the well-being of newborn children.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Democratic motion to recommit, and let us write a bill that will actually help all U.citizens get the coverage that they need and are entitled to.

So happy to have you back, Senator                             Net Neutrality  Mr.President, in the rubble of this week, the Federal Communications Commission is going to formally start the process of destroying net neutrality. A free and open internet is without question important to democracy and American innovation.  Apparently this FCC believes we no longer need the protections that keep internet service providers from discriminating against websites and online content, but these protections are[[Page S2989]]what make the internet what it is today. They mandate, very simply, that ISPs have to treat websites the same, whether they are Twitter or Facebook, Breitbart or the New York The FCC is supposed to be there to make sure ISPs follow this basic principle: Treat all content the same. But under this administration, these protections are being undermined.  It starts tomorrow when they will vote to begin the process to repeal net neutrality. I really don't know why the FCC thinks this is a good idea, because the internet is not broken. What problem were you trying to solve by getting rid of these protections, and on whose behalf are you working? There is not a single constituent in my State with whom I ever interacted--and I bet this is true for many other Members of the Senate and House--who says: You know those net neutrality protections? I hate them. You have to get rid of that net neutrality thing. It is bugging me and harming my access to the internet. I would like fast lanes and slow lanes. I would like my ISP to determine what I get to see and how quickly I get to see it.  There is literally no constituency for what is happening tomorrow, but there is one group that stands to gain here, and that is the ISPs, the companies that control your access to the internet. It is true that they are promising to keep the internet open and free. In fact, they did it just this week. A group of ISPs published a full page ad in the print version of the Washington Post reaffirming their commitment to voluntary net neutrality. In other words, they promised to be good to all of us as consumers. They are basically saying: You don't need the Federal Communications Commission to enforce any rule or law related to a free and open internet. We will do it voluntarily.  But here is the thing: Without net neutrality as a matter of rule and law, there is nothing that prevents them from treating content or websites differently. In fact, they will have financial incentives to do just that because making profits is their obligation. They have to maximize their profits. They have a fiduciary obligation to maximize profits. If there is an opportunity now or in the future to change the business model for internet service, changing the internet as we know it along the way, they are duty bound to pursue it. They do not have an obligation--a moral one or a statutory one or a legal one--to a free and open internet; they have an obligation to their shareholders and profits.  Here is what is going to happen if the FCC succeeds ending net neutrality once and for all: ISPs would be allowed to split content into two lanes--favorite content would be in the fast lane and everything else in the slow lane. Companies that need their content to be fast for video streaming or cloud services would have to pay to be in the fast lane. At the end of the day, the cost is going to be transferred to you, the consumer.  We would pay more for the same internet, but the issue here is bigger than a company that streams video asking an ISP to stream their content faster in exchange for more money. It is not just that. This is an era, as we all know, of corporate consolidation. The content companies and the ISPs are often one and the same. So it is not just that you would get Netflix negotiating with Comcast and maybe paying extra so they can stream their content so you can view it; it is also what happens when Comcast or some other company is also the content company.  I want everybody to think this through. If you were running a company that provided access to the internet and also owned content, wouldn't you be at least a little bit tempted--wouldn't your board of directors at least make you look at the possibility that if you have television shows and if you have websites and you depend on traffic, why in the world wouldn't you prioritize your own stuff? It is not apocryphal. It is not apocalyptic to imagine that a company would say: We are a vertical now, and we own content. Why are we going to put up our competitor's stuff at the same rates? The law doesn't provide for that anymore. Net neutrality is a thing of the past.  You don't have to imagine that these are bad people who are running these companies; you just have to imagine that they are businesspeople and that they run publicly traded companies that have to give quarterly earnings reports and have to show profit every single quarter. What better way to make profit than to create what they call on the internet a walled garden?  Everything seems like the internet you used to have, except it is all within one family of companies, and that is what net neutrality is designed to prevent. When you get on the internet, your ISPs can't tell you whether to go to Google or Bing or Yahoo or Facebook or Breitbart or the New York Times or the Honolulu Star-Advertiser or wherever it wants; you get it all at the same speed. That is what net neutrality is all about. But to the degree and extent that net neutrality protections are repealed as a matter of law, these companies can suddenly provide you with opportunities to see all their stuff and only their stuff. You will still have access to the other stuff. It might not stream very well or load very fast. That is what net neutrality is all about.  Entrepreneurs and small business owners will also be hurt. Think about what it takes to start and grow a business. You don't have extra cash to hand over to your ISPs to make sure people can access your content. Without net neutrality, new services, new websites, new big ideas will have a harder time competing with established businesses. That is why more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, investors, and startups from every single State have signed a letter asking that the FCC protect net neutrality--because it is critical for innovation.  When you think about how quickly the internet of things is gaining steam, it is also a big deal for what they call We are at a historic moment in innovation in the digital space.  Kevin Kelly, internet pioneer, recently did an interview with Stephen Dubner of Freakonomics They talked about the fact that in 2015 alone, 5 quintillion transistors were added to devices that were not computers. A quintillion is a billion billion. That is such an enormous number, it is hard to fathom. That is how fast the internet of things is growing. That is the level of innovation that is taking place, but this innovation depends on a free and open internet.  So the degree and extent that individual ISPs are able to control who gets what and at what speed, all of that innovation at the app level, the IoT level, all the cool stuff you are looking forward to from Silicon Valley or wherever it may be, is in danger because then it becomes about paying tolls. Then it becomes about a commercial negotiation. Then it becomes about lawyering up. You have a really good idea? Lawyer up. You have a really good idea? Get people who have a master's in business administration. Forget the engineers. Forget the content developers. Forget the creative class. What you have to do is figure out how to get in on what will essentially be what they call a closed shop. And that is what net neutrality is all about.  What if your internet service provider has a relationship with one of these websites? What if an auto sales website is purchased by a media company or vice versa? If you try to purchase a car online, you may end up in an internet funhouse if the FCC takes away net neutrality. It will look like the internet, but you may not have complete access to all the options. The same idea applies to the internet of things. If every car connects to the internet, broadband providers could decide that it takes too much bandwidth and pick and choose which brands are allowed to connect to the internet. That is what can happen without net neutrality.  They could offer a basic internet package that limits customers to certain websites or content, sort of how you buy basic cable and then decide whether you want ESPN or HBO or whatever additional channels. It is not totally out of the question that that could be the way you access the internet in the future.  The thing is, it sounds so scary, it sounds so crazy that you can't imagine it would happen. And it is true that it didn't happen in the past, but that is because it wasn't in their commercial interest to do it. Think about towns where there are one or two Think about a future 5 or 10 years from now when net neutrality is repealed. The moment it is in their commercial interest to do something to change the[[Page S2990]]very nature of the internet is the moment they will be duty bound to consider going forward.  When net neutrality was adopted under the previous FCC, there were 3.8 million people who provided comment. This is a very unique process. When the law passed that allowed ISPs to sell your commercial data, to sell your browsing data to third parties--that happened in a 30-hour period--basically, nobody noticed. We tried to mobilize. We got the word out. They had the votes, and it happened very quickly. This is different. Under the law, there is a public comment period. There were 3.8 million people who commented on the last net neutrality debate. There are already 1 million people who have commented through the FCC's website.  Tomorrow, the FCC will take an action that will open up the comment period and provide people an opportunity to weigh in on this. I would just offer that I do not believe there is any real constituency for what the FCC is doing. I think people across the country--young and old; left, right, and center; Democratic and Republican; urban and rural--everybody who cares about a free and open internet ought to care about what is happening tomorrow.  With that, I would like to yield to a Member of the Senate who has many years of leadership in this space, someone who has authored some of the statutory architecture that has allowed this innovation on the internet to occur, someone who fights for consumers, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS2974-3.txt,2173,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,17.0,June
11672,topic-id,505,"Mr.President, I thank Mr.Franken for his leadership on this issue. He is a person who understands the content industry and has been a fierce defender of people's ability to view content online, people's ability to express themselves online, and understands that a fair and open media marketplace is central to our democracy.  I want to address one assertion that was made by the proponents of repealing net neutrality; that is, that somehow the investment climate under net neutrality was harmed. They say there is some reason to believe that under net neutrality, the investment climate was diminished, but the Internet Association published research today that addressed this very issue, and their findings show that since 2015, when the rules went into place, telecommunications investment has actually increased. ISPs and their consumers are enjoying historically low production costs and innovation has increased. Free Press also published a report on this question earlier this week, and they found that investment in broadband by publicly traded companies actually went up after net neutrality went into place. Here is what the research director at the Free Press had to say: ``If investment is the FCC's preferred metric, then there is only one possible conclusion--net neutrality and Title II are a smashing success.''  Here is the point. The internet is not broken. There are parts of the economy that are not working well. We struggle with manufacturing. We need to invest in infrastructure. We have a trade imbalance. We have a higher education system that is not working for everybody. We need to do more work in these areas, but the part of our economy that is working great for consumers, for entrepreneurs, for the private sector, for engaged citizens is the internet itself. Tomorrow, the FCC is going to endeavor to break it.  Before I hand it over to someone who has been working on these issues for many years, I want to point out that nobody would have anticipated that the Affordable Care Act would still be on the books because of unprecedented online and inperson organizing.  The FCC has a very unique process where there is going to be a 3-month public comment period. The statute actually allows the public to go and weigh in on what they think. The last time this happened when net neutrality principles were being established, 3.8 million people commented. So far, before they even take their first formal action, there are 1.6 million people who have already commented. My guess is, by the time tomorrow is[[Page S2994]]done--maybe the next day--we will be well into the 2 to 3 million comment range, and they still have 3 months to go. Understand the power in our democracy still resides with the people. Somebody who has been working in the trenches on this issue and many consumer issues for a very long time is my great colleague, the senior Senator from Connecticut, and I will yield to him as I realize I think I am standing at his dais.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS2974-3.txt,2173,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,17.0,June
11844,topic-id,1138,"Mr.President, you might think that for the last 7 years, the major complaint people had about the Affordable Care Act was that it hurt rich people, because they seem to be the only people who stand to gain with this Republican Senate healthcare plan. They get a giant tax break. The rest of America, on the other hand, is in trouble.  With TrumpCare, healthcare will cost more, and 22 million people are going to lose their healthcare altogether. Some healthcare bill. To put this in perspective, imagine if everyone lost their healthcare in Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Alaska, West Virginia, Ohio, Idaho, and That is what TrumpCare does. That is 22 million It also devastates one of the best healthcare programs this country has.  With this bill, Medicaid is going to lose nearly $800 billion. If your only worry is that your investment income gets taxed at 3.8 percent every year, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Let me drill down on that because one of the most egregious tax breaks in this bill--and this is mostly a tax cut bill and not a healthcare bill--is the following: If you are making $200,000 as an individual or $250,000 as a couple, capital gains income is currently taxed at 3.8 percent. If you are making $200,000 as an individual or $250,000 as a couple and you have capital gains, not regular income, it is taxed at 3.8 percent. This bill zeros that tax out. This bill zeros that tax out. On top of that, it is retroactive. Think about the absurdity.  Here we are. I am looking at the Senator from Pennsylvania and how much he has advocated for children and especially for children with disabilities. I am looking at the Senator from Connecticut and the work he has done for people with chronic diseases and mental health challenges and the resources we need for that. And in the middle of a supposedly oriented toward healthcare piece of legislation, we are giving a retroactive capital gains tax cut to people who make over $250,000 a year in combined income. It is absurd. It is not a healthcare bill.  If you have a loved one in a nursing home, if you are pregnant or thinking of having a baby, if your kid has a disability that requires costly care, if you work two jobs but your employer doesn't provide health insurance, then this bill does not take care of you. Instead of less taxes, you get less care, and you are going to pay more for it.  This is what happens when legislators don't have committee hearings or they refuse to meet with patients, doctors, nurses, advocates, their own constituents. There have been so few townhalls about healthcare. There have been so few real Senate debates about healthcare.  I have seen every single Democratic Member of the Senate come here and[[Page S3771]]talk about this piece of legislation. I have seen every single Republican Member of the Senate talk about legislation that they are proud of. I have seen very few people on the Republican side of the aisle come down and talk about this bill because they know it is not a good piece of legislation.  At this point, we are not even debating healthcare policy. It is not a question of what is the best way to get people to sign up for insurance or how we can lower premiums and deductibles or how we can improve the delivery system; it is a question of how many people are going to lose their healthcare so that insurance company CEOs can continue to make millions of dollars a year. That is literally what is in this bill. Those are the conversations we are having--nothing related to reforming the healthcare system or getting people more coverage for less but, rather, tax cuts for people who are involved in the healthcare industry.  How many grandparents are going to get kicked out of nursing homes? It is not a rhetorical question. My wife's grandmother was in a nursing home 2 months ago. It was a beautiful facility. They took great care of her. They had three beds, three nursing home beds. I think the normal reimbursement is about $9,000 a month. They took wonderful care of my wife's grandmother. They won't exist. That nursing home and all the nursing homes like it won't exist if there is an $800 billion cut to This is not a theoretical conversation. This isn't even a partisan conversation. Everybody has nursing home beds in all of their home Everybody at least ought to know some middle-class people who rely on Medicaid for nursing homes.  CBO gave us the answer today. Too many people are going to be locked out of the healthcare system if this bill goes forward, and all for giant tax cuts.  Look, our healthcare system is not perfect. Changes need to be made, but this bill is just not it. It has no clear guiding principle other than slashing Medicaid to pay for tax cuts. We have to start over.  I am looking at the Presiding Officer, who was a speaker of the house in North Carolina and understands how to do a bill on a bipartisan basis. I am thinking of the numerous Republicans who are capable of working on a bipartisan bill that can get 60 votes.  By the way, the politics would change because if we worked on a bill that could get 60 votes, we would be in a wonderful position--the Senate is set up to encourage us to work together--because if we abide by that 60-vote threshold and we come up with a bill together, we would own the American healthcare system together. We don't get to play this blame game about what is happening with premiums or what is happening with coverage numbers. We actually, on the level, collaborate.  When you think about a bill or an issue that used to be as partisan as public education, we had Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray come together. Heck, in the last Congress, we had Jim Inhofe and Barbara Boxer do a bill together. It is possible for us to do a bipartisan piece of legislation.  The decision was made to go with reconciliation, and that is backfiring because the problem with not involving Democrats is that there are Democrats across the country. The problem with not involving experts is that you end up with a product you can't defend.  What we really need to do is take a breath, take the Fourth of July weekend, and reconvene as a Congress--not as Democrats and Republicans but as Americans who understand that our healthcare system is not perfect, that it is in need of improvement, but this bill doesn't get it done.

Until we hear further news, our hearts will be in our mouths, hoping for the best. Our thoughts and prayers, as a Senate family, are with the junior Senator from North Carolina and his family.                          Russia Investigation  Mr.President, on a different subject, the events of the last 2 weeks have shaken my confidence in this administration's competence and credibility. There has been revelation after revelation, allegation after allegation of misconduct on the part of the President and his team. In the past 2 days, it has reached new heights.  The President, according to reports in the Washington Post and the New York Times, may have divulged classified information to a known adversary and actively tried to quash an investigation of a close political ally.  From the President's own words, we already know that the Russia investigation was on his mind when he fired Mr.We now know it may not have been the first time the President has taken an action to impede an active investigation of his campaign or associates, if the reports in the New York Times are true.  Concerns about our national security, the rule of law, the independence of our Nation's highest law enforcement agencies are mounting in this land. The stated explanations for these events from the White House have been porous, shifting, and all too often contradictory.  The country is being tested in unprecedented ways. What is now required are the facts and impartial investigations into these very serious matters. The White House should make available to the Intelligence Committees the transcripts and any related summaries of the Oval Office meeting between President Trump and the Russian Foreign Minister and We can then assess exactly what was said and understand the consequences of any intelligence that was shared with the  On the topic of Mr.Comey, if the President has tapes of his conversation with Mr.Comey, we ought to be able to review those tapes as well to see if the President pressured the FBI Director to shut down an active investigation. The Times reported that Mr.Comey kept contemporaneous memos of his conversation with the President, and Mr.Comey has a reputation for accuracy in those memos. Those memos should also be provided to the congressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, and Mr.Comey should testify before those committees in public. Indeed, providing the Congress the tapes and memos may be the only way for this administration to credibly make a case to a justifiably skeptical American public about its version of the story reported by the New York The President says what Comey said was wrong. Prove it. It is easy to prove it, as long as there are tapes or transcripts of what happened. If the President is right, he will have no problem releasing memos, tapes, or transcripts that corroborate his story. But if he fails to release them, the American public will justifiably tend to side with Mr.Comey, not what the President had to say, particularly in light of so much backtracking, backsliding, and factual fabrication in this White  Finally, the events of this past week only heighten the need for a special prosecutor who is truly independent to run the Department of Justice's investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and The American people must have faith in the integrity and impartiality of this investigation. We have learned, if the reporting is accurate, that the President is willing to directly interfere with an active investigation. Whether or not it breaks the law is not the point here. The point is, he was trying to interfere with an investigation. How can anyone trust someone in the President's chain of command, someone who the President has appointed, after those actions? The only way out is a special prosecutor. It is the right thing to do.  We know the President is willing to fire an FBI Director because of this investigation, in his own words. It makes all the sense in the world to have a special prosecutor who can be fired only for cause to lead the Russia investigation. That would help protect the integrity of the investigation by insulating it from a White House, which at the very minimum, is overreaching.  Given the circumstances, these requests are reasonable. They are modest. I hope--I really pray--that my friends on the other side of the aisle will see that now is the time to put party considerations aside and do what is right for our country. I know that several of my colleagues--Senators from Maine, Tennessee, Arizona--have expressed concerns. A few have gone further and endorsed some of the actions I have mentioned. It is a good first step, but it is not enough. In the past 24 hours, there has been more movement among Republicans in the House than here in the The Senate, by its traditions, should be leading this effort, not following. More of my Republican friends should join the Senators from Maine, Tennessee, and Arizona in speaking out about these events first but, far more importantly, helping us get to the bottom of them in an impartial, trusted, and respected way.  To my friends on the other side of the aisle: America needs you; America[[Page S2975]]needs you now. America needs you to help pressure the Deputy Attorney General to name a special prosecutor to compel this White House to turn over the transcripts and tapes to Congress, to demonstrate that the Congress the American people elected, Democrats and Republicans, can come together to do the right thing when it matters most. I repeat to all of my colleagues: History is watching.  This is not a casual or usual time. As great as the desire would be to repeal ObamaCare or do tax reform, the very faith in the institutions of government now are being tested. They have been tested in the past. This is not the first time in American history they have been tested, but in the past, there have been people who rose above party, rose above an immediate interest to defend the needs of the Is it going to happen now?  History will judge on whether this Congress and these Senators have been able to do what so many Senators before us, Democrats and Republicans, have done in the past: Put country above party. Whether we have decided to act as an appropriate check and balance as the Founders intended or whether we will let this continue, history will judge us all. Whether we decide to act in the way that is appropriate, history will judge us.

For 2 days, the White House implied that the decision to fire Mr.Comey either originated or was largely influenced by the recommendations from the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney The Vice President of the United States spoke to reporters here on Capitol Hill and said that it was the President's ``decision to accept the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General to remove Director Comey.''  Those accounts, by the spokespeople of the President and the Vice President himself, were just blatantly and completely contradicted by the President himself on national television.  President Trump told NBC News that it was his decision to fire Mr.Comey, and he had made up his mind to do so before hearing from either the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, in direct contradiction to what his own Vice President and his own press people were saying.  Well, which one was it? Did the Vice President mislead the public or did the President? When was the decision made to fire Mr.Comey, and what was the reason? And why did it take so long for the White House to get its story straight?  These are all critical questions, and the American people deserve answers. We need to understand the true nature of the events that led to Director Comey's dismissal, why it happened, and what it means for the investigation into the potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia as we move forward.  This morning, I made a request of the majority leader to call an all-Senators briefing with Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Given the events of this week, and particularly after what the President said this afternoon, a briefing from these two officials before the whole Senate, where Senators from both parties can ask and get answers to the serious questions hanging over us, is imperative for this body and for the American people. The all-Senators briefing with the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General should be separate and partially classified, if necessary.  The need for these briefings is even greater now than it was this morning, given what the President said this afternoon. The rule of law, the separation of powers, and their strength--hallmarks of American democracy--are at stake.  Now, I have just heard from the majority leader that he will invite Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to an all-Senators briefing next week. I asked the majority leader to do the briefing early in the week. It is a good first step, and I thank the majority leader for consenting to this request.  Mr.Rosenstein was here on the Hill today meeting with He requested to meet with me, and I said I wanted to meet with him along with my 99 colleagues so Members of both parties were given the opportunity to question him. I am glad he has a willingness to come talk to Congress, and I hope he will accept our bipartisan invitation from Leader McConnell and from me to brief the entire Senate next week.  My caucus still believes that Attorney General Sessions must be made available to the Senate in a similar capacity, given his reported role in firing Director Comey and helping select his replacement. Considering his recusal from the Russia investigation, his close involvement in these events warrants the Senate's questioning as well, but I thank the majority leader for trying to set up the briefing with Mr.It is very likely, I believe, that it will happen, just pending Mr.Rosenstein's consent, and I hope the majority leader soon comes to the right decision and grants our request to question Mr.Sessions as well.

11782,topic-id,983,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.  Mr.Speaker, 7 years ago, I brought the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to the floor of the House as chairwoman of the House Rules This law was a statement from Congress on behalf of the American people that unchecked corporate greed will never again bring the United States of America to financial collapse.  My colleague began his speech this morning by saying that this law had not worked, but I am not aware of major bank failures or bank failures of any kind since we passed it, and I would say, indeed, this law has worked.  Since it has been enacted, our economy has had over 80 consecutive months of private sector job growth. That is pretty good. In fact, it is a record-setting streak. More than 16 million jobs have been created, and business lending has been increased by 75 percent. I am not getting all the complaints that I used to get that they could not borrow money from banks, particularly the small businesses.  Along the way, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established under this law has helped 29 million people in all of our 50 States to receive nearly $12 billion in relief from companies that engaged in irresponsible or predatory practices.  One group that sent us a letter begging us not to do away with Dodd-Frank was the Veterans of Foreign Wars who said that far too often their veterans were the victims of predatory lenders--shysters, people not telling them the truth--and that is exactly what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established to do.  You can't argue about whether or not it has been a success if 29 million people in 50 States have gotten back $12 billion in relief of bad practices. But this legislation completely will do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the only thing we have left to protect Main Street and the small investors.  These gains weren't a coincidence, Mr.They were the result of the Dodd-Frank law. Gutting Wall Street reform will be a historic giveaway to special interests.                              {time}  1315  The Wall Street firms who plunged our country to the brink, in 2008, would be free once again to take advantage of consumers and force middle class families to go it alone, without the protections this bill has provided them.  The CHOICE Act is the wrong choice for consumers and families. Instead of standing with financial lobbyists, I urge the majority to uphold the trust of the people we all represent.  Five years ago, Democrats and Republicans came together to almost unanimously pass my bill to end insider trading in The STOCK Act passed this Chamber by a vote of 417-2, one of the most bipartisan bills of that entire session of  It wasn't easy. I led a 6-year fight to get it signed into law after learning that Members of Congress and their staffs were abusing their positions by making money from the information that they gleaned and that was not available to everybody else in They gleaned this information while[[Page H4666]]working on behalf of the people whose information they were stealing. It took a ``60 Minutes'' investigation on television and a groundswell of public support, but the bill became a reality.  For me, upholding the people's trust is the most sacred responsibility I have as a Member of That is why I am waging a new battle to strengthen the STOCK Act, after learning that some in this Congress have used legal loopholes to get around this law.

During the 2008 financial crash, more than 8 million Americans lost their jobs, $13 trillion in wealth vanished overnight, and 11 million homes were lost.  After years of excesses and dodging regulation, the financial firms were finally brought under control by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection The perverse notion of too big to fail was finally ended, and the financial playing field was tilted back toward consumers.  We have all seen the results of the law in the form of record-setting private sector job growth, millions of new jobs, and historic rates of business lending.

11683,topic-id,609,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to Rachel Brand's nomination to the 3 spot in the Justice Now, there are many reasons I am opposed to this nomination, but those reasons are all grounded in a central question facing America today: Whom does this government work for? Does it work just for the rich and powerful? Does it work just for the well connected? Does it work just for the billionaire in the White House or does it work for everyone?  One of the worst kept secrets in America is that there are two justice systems; one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else. The first justice system is an exclusive club for giant corporations and wealthy individuals. In that justice system, serious crimes are punished with a slap on the wrist and a small fine. Taxpayers bail out corporations that stole the life savings, and wealthy criminals go back to their lives without missing a beat.  The second justice system is for those who can't buy their way out of prison time. In that system, minor, nonviolent offenses are punished with harsh prison sentences. When those individuals are eventually released, they are branded with the scarlet letter that closes doors to employment and opportunity. It is a system that swallows up people whole and spits them out with nothing.  Americans are very familiar with the difference between those two justice systems. We saw the difference after the worst financial crisis in a generation, when Wall Street tycoons who gambled away the life savings of working Americans walked away free as a bird. We saw it in the War on Drugs when countless Black and Brown people were shoveled into prisons, where they wasted their lives away.  We need to fix this problem. We should be devoting every resource we have to fixing this problem. That starts with the Justice Department, the agency responsible for ensuring that nobody is above the law, and everyone--everyone is held accountable.  Unfortunately, it has been pretty clear to me for some time now that President Trump's Justice Department is pushing as hard as possible in the opposite direction. For much of President Obama's second term, prosecutors were allowed some discretion to consider the unique circumstances of each case and make a measured decision about when to ask for the most serious charge with the maximum penalty or when to ask for less.  It worked. Jail time for low-level drug offenses went down. States saved money, and lives were not irretrievably broken. Last week, that modest advance came to an end. Attorney General Sessions directed prosecutors to charge individuals with the harshest sentences possible. ``Lock them up'' seems to be his approach--but not in all cases. Jeff Sessions sings a very different tune when it comes to white-collar crime. He believes corporations should not be punished for the actions of their executives. Don't punish the companies for a few bad CEO apples.  In Jeff Session's world, we should throw the book at criminals, unless they are rich and powerful. Now, President Trump has chosen to somewhat help Jeff Sessions carry out his vision. His choice to be the third highest ranking official at the Justice Department is Rachel Brand, the nominee for Associate Attorney  She is well equipped to carry out that soft-on-white-collar-crime approach. She has extensive experience--years of experience--fighting on behalf of the biggest and richest companies in the world. She spent years leading the Chamber of Commerce's assault on the rules that protect working families, evidently deciding time after time that it is corporations that should get every break.

11848,topic-id,1267,"Mr.President, we have just gotten the latest numbers on the Senate Republicans' reckless plan to take away health insurance from millions of American families, take it away from sick, little kids, take it away from seniors in nursing homes. These numbers are worse than anyone expected.  After weeks of secret work behind closed doors, the Republicans came up with a plan that will take away health insurance from 22 million people and slash the Medicaid Program by nearly $800 billion, all in exchange for shoveling hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts to the richest families in this country.  You know, with results like these, Senate Republicans should not still be trying to figure out the best way to ram this bill through the They should just throw it in the trash.  We don't have a lot of time left, and I know it is easy to tune out these debates and to assume these are all just a bunch of partisan games. So if you aren't inclined to take my word for it, don't, and don't take the Republicans' word for it either. Take a look at what the experts are saying about the Republican bill because since this brutal bill was finally revealed on Thursday, it has been denounced by nonpartisan doctors groups, health policy experts, and patient organizations. The American Medical Association says the bill violates the fundamental principle of medicine: ``First, do no harm.'' The Children's Hospital Association says it is ``a major step backward for children and their health.'' The National Council for Behavioral Health says, ``Instead of `repeal and replace,' it is `wreck and wreak havoc.'''  Lynn Nicholas, the head of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association, has actually come up with a pretty simple test for the Republican plan: ``I challenge any Republican Senator to name one thing in this bill that will make healthcare in the U.better for patients or healthcare professionals who care for them.''  Think about that. She says use that as the test, one thing. That is a pretty low bar--one thing. Yet the Republicans can't pass that test. They can't name one thing in this bill that will improve healthcare in That is because this bill is not supposed to improve healthcare in It is not a healthcare bill. It is a tax cut for the rich, paid for by gutting healthcare for millions of working  Doctors, patients, parents, families, experts, they are terrified by this bill because they have read it, and they have concluded that nearly every line in this bill would make life worse for young people and for old people and for families across this country.  I want to focus on just one major part tonight, the part that rips away the Medicaid Let's do some basic Medicaid facts. Who uses Medicaid? Thirty million kids. That is about 4 out of every 10 kids in this country count on Medicaid to help pay the medical bills. About 6 out of 10 children with complex medical needs--children who need breathing tubes, special therapies, and multiple surgeries, 6 out of 10 of those children count on Medicaid to help pay their medical bills. Nearly two out of three seniors in nursing homes count on Medicaid to help pay their bills, and one out of every three people dealing with addiction counts on Medicaid to help pay for treatment.  Who uses Medicaid? America uses Medicaid--children, the elderly, hard-working families, people with disabilities, and people struggling with addiction. At any given moment in this country, one in every five Americans is counting on Medicaid to help pay the bills. What are these people supposed to do when the Medicaid expansion goes away, when this bill's additional massive Medicaid cuts go into effect? What are they supposed to do? What are their families supposed to do?  Dig in on one issue around this. Dig in on opioid abuse. This is a problem that is growing around the country. Last year we lost 2,000 people in Massachusetts alone. I hear from parents who have lost children, from brothers and sisters who have watched a loved one disappear. I hear from people who are desperate because their child or sister or brother can't get into a treatment facility. I hear from dedicated doctors, nurses, and counselors who need more resources so they can expand treatment programs. Now the Republicans propose a bill that is like throwing gasoline on a bonfire. One in three people struggling with an addiction are counting on Medicaid, and the Republicans plan to cut nearly $1 trillion from the program. I do not understand. I cannot understand how the Republicans could turn their backs on literally millions of people who need help.  The cuts to Medicaid are terrible, but there is more. The Republican bill also slashes the tax credits that people use to help pay for insurance. The budget nerds at the Congressional Budget Office say that ``most people'' would ``have higher out of pocket spending on healthcare than under current law.''  Think about that. Under the Republican plan, healthcare costs will go up for most people, and even if someone can manage, somehow, to afford coverage under the Republican bill, the Republicans are willing to let insurance companies drop expensive benefits that the companies just don't want to cover, including--are you ready?--opioid treatment. If this bill passes, it will devastate our ability to fight opioid overdoses. This isn't a hypothetical. This isn't speculation. Before the Affordable Care Act became law, one-third of individual market health plans didn't cover substance use disorder services, and about one in five plans didn't cover mental health services. The insurance companies don't want to cover these services, but the ACA made coverage mandatory. That[[Page S3776]]meant that no one in this country had to wonder when they showed up at a clinic whether or not their insurance would help them out, but the Republican bill opens the door to dropping those requirements. Millions more people could be left out in the cold at a time when they most need help. This is cruel. Our country is already struggling with a treatment gap, and far too many patients facing addiction can't get the care they need. The last thing we should be doing is kicking millions of these patients off of the coverage they already have.  Now, let's face it. The Republicans realized this, and they have a plan on this issue. They know that what they are doing is indefensible. So they have a plan. They propose to throw $2 billion into a special fund for opioid treatment and say: Problem solved. This is political spin at its worst.  For every dollar the Republicans propose to put into opioid treatment, they are taking out more than $100 from Medicaid, the rock on which our ability to provide opioid addiction treatment is built. Why? Why treat our brothers and sisters, our children, our elderly parents so shamefully? Why? So that Republicans can produce a giant tax cut for a handful of millionaires and billionaires. That is it. Our friends, our families, and our kids can struggle on their own. They can die on their own so that Republicans can cut taxes for the richest people in this country.  What the Republicans propose is morally wrong. It is not too late to do the right thing. It is not too late to reverse course. It is not too late to junk this bill and start over. I hope the Senate Republicans have the courage to do exactly that.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Rounds).

Mr.Speaker, let me take just a few moments to talk to you about the harmful effects Dodd-Frank has had on my home State of As of just a few months ago, in Texas alone, 358 State or federally chartered banks, credit unions, or thrifts have either closed or merged since 2010, when Dodd-Frank became law.

Mass consolidations and closures have left many Texans few options, something the previous administration promised.

11665,topic-id,1299,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for not just today but all of the years in which he has led this battle. He is right. We have served together now in both Chambers and, in fact, when I was here and he was in the other body, we talked often about why this was such a bedrock principle.  You know, sometimes you listen to the head of the FCC and you get the sense that somehow he is saying that the internet either is broken or is about to break--that some horrendous set of problems are going to ensue without his ill-advised ideas. The fact is that the internet is not broken. The Federal Communications Commission is not trying to help consumers by rolling back net neutrality protections. They are doing it to make it easier for the big cable companies to be in a position to shove out true and real competition. That, I would say to my friend Senator Markey and my friend from Hawaii, Senator Schatz, who has been championing these efforts in the Commerce Committee, is what this is really all about.  You know, the reality is that the internet is now the shipping lane for the 21st century. It is that place--a global marketplace--where you have the free exchange of ideas, and today's rules protect that shipping lane of the 21st century--the freedom for Americans and people worldwide to compete online. It exists so that the powerful interests, those who have the deepest pockets, do not go out and swallow the little guys up every single time.  Now, as we talk about net neutrality and why it is so essential for jobs, free speech, political engagement, education, economic opportunity, and better competition, there are really just three points. First, protecting the free and open internet under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, in my view, is the best way to proceed at this point. It is the only way, at present, to ensure a free and open internet, and that is, by rejecting this idea that somehow the internet is broken and we should upend the current rules. The Federal Communications Commission should not only leave the current net neutrality rules in place, they ought to aggressively move against companies that violate those rules. As my friends from Massachusetts and Hawaii know, there is not exactly a lot of evidence that the Federal Communications Commission is doing that either.  Net neutrality, in short, protects the internet's ability to give a fair shake to every single person in America and literally in the world with a good idea--they don't have to have money. They don't have to have lobbyists. They don't have to have All they have to have with net neutrality and the internet is an idea to compete with the establishment. This level playing field is a prerequisite for protecting free speech.  A level regulatory playing field means that these powerful interests--the cable companies, specifically--can't pick winners and losers because of their political or personal views. Our colleague, Senator Franken of Minnesota, has correctly said that net neutrality is the First Amendment issue of our time, and I think he is spot-on on that matter.  Finally, because there really hasn't been the competition in the broadband marketplace that would best serve the consumer and the public, what you should definitely do is operate under the theory that you need strong rules. We all know that too many people don't have a choice when it comes to a broadband provider; often it comes down to Comcast or nothing. Without real competition, America needs strong net neutrality rules to prevent Comcast or AT&T from basically tossing consumer choice and free speech in the trash can to rake in even more profits.  A lack of broadband competition and consumer choice is clearly a problem you cannot solve by giving the big cable companies more freedom--freedom to run at will through the marketplace.  So the question now is--and I think my friend from Massachusetts just touched on it--what happens now? What happens now is making the American people aware that this is the time for their voices to be heard.  The fact is, there are two notions of political change in Some people think it starts in Washington, DC, and in government buildings in various capitals and then trickles down to the grassroots.  Senator Schatz, Senator Markey, and I take a different view with respect to how you bring about political change in It is not top-down; it is bottom-up. It is bottom-up as Americans from all walks of life weigh in with their legislators, weigh in with the Federal Communications My guess is that pretty soon--probably tomorrow--the future of the internet is going to be in the hands of the Federal Communications  I just want to wrap up my remarks by talking about how important it is for the American people to go online to the Federal Communications Commission website and file a comment, and visit my website--wyden.senate.gov--where you can get more information.  I will close with this: I think my friends--certainly Senator Markey and Senator Schatz--may have heard this. I want to talk about the fight against internet piracy because we are all against internet piracy. No one is in favor of that kind of thievery, but we didn't think it made sense to damage the architecture of the internet--the domain name systems and the fundamental principles by which the internet operates--in the name of fighting piracy.  When there was a bill with a shortsighted view--it was called SOPA and PIPA--and it was introduced, scores and scores of Senators supported it immediately. I put a hold on this bill. I put a public hold on the bill. I chaired a little subcommittee of the Senate Finance There were close to a majority of Senators already in support of this flawed bill. We began to talk to those around the country who understand what it really means if you damage the internet and its architecture for a shortsighted and, in this case, unworkable approach.  Everybody thought we didn't have a chance of winning. There was very close to a majority in the Senate actually cosponsoring it. So a vote was scheduled on whether to lift my hold on this bill, the flawed PIPA and SOPA bill.  Four days before the vote was to take place on whether to lift my hold, 15 million Americans emailed, texted, called, went to community meetings. They went out all across the country. Mind you, these 15 million Americans were focused and spent more time online in a week than they did thinking about their U.Senator in a couple of years.  They said this defies common sense. We are not for internet piracy, but don't destroy the internet.[[Page S2992]]  My hope is, once again, with the odds stacked against our side--the odds stacked against Senator Schatz, Senator Markey, and all the Senators who have been willing, on our side, to speak up against these powerful interests that really would like to gut net neutrality--that those who understand what the freedom of the net is all about, what it means to have this ability to communicate that is so vital to people without clout and power, will take the fight for the consumer, for the man and woman who just want a fair shake when they get an idea. My hope is, just as they did a few years ago in blocking this ill-advised SOPA and PIPA bill, that those who care so much about freedom and a fair shot for everybody will, once again, take the fight to the Federal Communications Commission, knowing that their voices can make a difference. They have made a difference in the past.  It is a real pleasure to be with Senator Markey and Senator  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS2974-3.txt,1247,1300,2017.0,17.0,July

11634,topic-id,1188,"Mr.President, I am pleased to join Senator Murphy to discuss the importance of this humanitarian crisis in As he so cogently emphasized, this is, at once, a humanitarian crisis and also a security crisis in the region and beyond.  I am a new member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and I have to say that I have quickly come to admire Senator Murphy for his forceful advocacy of our values of universal human rights and of American international leadership. So I commend him for his leadership on this issue in particular.  I share many of the concerns articulated by Senator Murphy with regard to the situation in Yemen and the Saudi-led coalition there in that country. Before getting into the specific situation in Yemen, however, I think it is important to step back and look at the big picture.  The world currently confronts humanitarian crises of a magnitude we haven't seen in many, many years. Parts of Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen are all in famine or prefamine stages. According to the United Nations, 20 million people are at risk of starvation within the next few months in these four countries.  The Director-General of the International Committee of the Red Cross appeared before our Senate Foreign Relations Committee just weeks ago, and he called the crises ``one of the most critical humanitarian issues to face mankind since the end of the Second World War.'' He warned that ``we are at the brink of a humanitarian mega-crisis unprecedented in recent history.''  Each of these crises are unique. They have their unique man-made causes. But in each case, the crises are preventable. They have been exacerbated by war and restrictions on humanitarian access. Now, they are complicated. The situation in Yemen is certainly a complicated one. But the United Nations calls the situation in Yemen the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. According to their Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Yemen has almost 19 million people in need of humanitarian or protection assistance, including approximately 10 million who require immediate assistance to save their lives or to sustain their lives.  This is an urgent matter, which is why I am so glad we have the leadership of Senator Murphy on this matter and some of my other colleagues on various fronts. This is why I led a 10-Member letter to Secretary Tillerson on March 23 calling for a diplomatic surge to address the political obstacles preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid. I note that Senator Murphy joined me on that letter, which I personally hand-delivered to Secretary It is also why I raised the issue with Ambassador Haley in New York It is why I introduced a resolution on April 5 calling for the very same thing. Senators Cardin, Boozman, Coons, Gardner, and Rubio joined that resolution.  Throughout this process, rather than just studying the problem, I--working with my colleagues--have tried to focus on tangible steps we can take to save lives and address this very troubling national security situation. For that reason, on April 27, joined by Senator Murphy and several other colleagues, I sent a letter to the incoming Saudi Noting the important security partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia's essential role as a regional leader and an ally and a partner, I asked Riyadh to consider five specific steps related to Yemen that would prevent thousands or even millions of additional people from starving there.  There is no doubt that the Houthis and the Iranians bear a very large portion of the blame for this whole situation. I asked our ally Saudi Arabia to take these steps because the United States has a valuable security relationship with Saudi Arabia and because we can oppose Iran's activities in Yemen while ending unnecessary delays in the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian assistance. These two goals are not mutually exclusive.  I didn't receive a satisfactory response, so I subsequently raised these issues with the Saudi Foreign Minister in a meeting on Capitol In that meeting, I cited the fact--confirmed again by the administration within the last week--that the Saudi-led coalition continues to impose significant delays on the delivery of humanitarian aid to the port of Hodeidah on the Red Again, this is important because the port of Hodeidah processes roughly 70 to 80 percent of Yemen's food and other critical imports. I mentioned to the Foreign Minister the U.S.-funded cranes for the port of Hodeidah that would dramatically improve the ability to offload humanitarian supplies at that port. I expressed concerns to the[[Page S2978]]Foreign Minister about the humanitarian impact of an attack on the port of Yet, as the suffering of the Yemeni people continues and even worsens, these issues regretfully remain unresolved.  According to the administration--confirmed again this morning--the Saudi-led coalition continues to be responsible for an average of 16 days of additional delays to humanitarian shipments into the port of Hodeidah after vessels are cleared by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism for Think about it. Your children are starving to death. Perhaps your entire village is starving to death. And you have a delay of an additional 16 days in humanitarian shipments. Think of the impact that has on security in the region as desperate people are forced to take desperate measures to associate themselves with bad actors in the area. It is certainly troubling to me.  For that reason, I have decided to cosponsor Senator Murphy's legislation, S.40. Before the United States can transfer air-to-ground munitions to Saudi Arabia, the legislation requires the President of the United States to make a number of certifications. One of those includes a certification that Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners are making demonstrable efforts to facilitate the flow of critical humanitarian aid and commercial goods. I don't believe the President could credibly make that assertion until the Saudis take some of the steps I have called for.  As President Trump prepares his visit to Saudi Arabia, I urge him to raise these critical issues with the Saudi I urge our President to emphasize that these are humanitarian and national security issues that are priorities of the American people. I urge the administration to ask the Saudi Government to take the following concrete actions: First, renounce any intention to conduct a military operation against the port of Hodeidah; second, redouble efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution; third, end any delays to the delivery of humanitarian aid caused by the Saudi-led coalition; and fourth, permit the delivery of much needed U.funded cranes to the port of Hodeidah that would permit the quicker delivery of food and medicine.  I have said it before: With more than 10 million Yemenis requiring immediate humanitarian assistance, there is no time to waste. I stand ready to work with our Saudi partners to fight Iran's malign influence and to take these specific steps to begin to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation in  I again thank Senator Murphy for his leadership and for the opportunity to join him on the floor today. I look forward to working together again in the future.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgS2974-3.txt,1256,RURAL AMERICA'S CONTRIBUTIONS,2017.0,17.0,July
11636,topic-id,205,"It is a critical question, and it is one I have been asking so many stakeholders involved in this issue. No one has presented to me persuasive evidence indicating that a Saudi-led attack on the port would result in defeat of the Houthis-Saleh bloc. No one has presented to me evidence that I find compelling that that action would even force the Houthis bloc to the negotiating table.  The onus ought to be on those who might take a military action--which would exacerbate the worst humanitarian crisis in the world--to present that evidence. I have asked for it. I haven't received it.  I think it is just as likely that an attack would push the Houthis, as I alluded to earlier, into further alignment with and dependence on the Iranians, with whom they are allied. That is the exact opposite of what we are trying to accomplish in the region, as the Iranians continue to spread their influence and their terroristic activities across the Middle So this is not in the interests, as I see it, based on all the evidence available, of the United States, UAE, or Saudi Arabia, and it would result in both a humanitarian catastrophe and exacerbate the national security situation.

11638,topic-id,303,"The last thing we want to do is to exacerbate a situation where we already have 10 million desperate people on the cusp of starvation or passing away on account of a lack of medical supplies.  We need assistance here, which is why it is important for the President to elevate the importance of this issue in his conversation with the Saudis during his coming visit, and I believe he will do so. I believe he will do so because the international community, NGOs, understand the importance of this. Many at the State Department and the U.Agency for International Development have spoken about what a serious crisis this is. And we don't want to be shortsighted with respect to what a bombing of the port could catalyze.  We also need to recognize that there are other players in the Saudi coalition that can be constructive as well. The Emirates, I would note, have shown a willingness to be helpful on a couple of different fronts.  I had the opportunity to visit with the Crown Prince yesterday and received his assurance that he would seek to resolve without delay a situation related to the forward stationing of inspectors in his country so that they can pre-inspect cargo before it goes into the port of Hodeidah, and that would expedite the process and help mitigate a lot of the suffering that is occurring. Also, I had an opportunity to discuss with the Crown Prince this issue of four cranes. U.taxpayers paid for these cranes. I mentioned them in my prepared remarks earlier. And I have heard from the Crown Prince; he made a commitment there as well. So I am grateful for his commitment, and I look forwarding to following up with the UAE Government on this front.

11651,topic-id,682,"Mr.President, I rise to join the senior Senator from Indiana in voicing my strong support for the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017. During Police Week, I wish to take a minute to thank all of our men and women in blue who stand on the frontlines to protect our communities.  I have four young children. Since they could barely talk, my wife and I taught them that if they need help, they should dial 911, and the police would respond.  Every day our law enforcement communities around the country live their lives to answer these calls and to help our fellow citizens. Sometimes the job is as simple as reuniting a child with their parent at the park or at a store, but other times they see horrific scenes that no one should have to experience in their lifetimes or they experience traumatic stress in the performance of their jobs.  Ultimately, police officers see the best and the worst of humanity, which can take a heavy emotional toll, but who is there to answer the call for help when they need it after experiencing such trauma on a regular basis?  A couple of weeks ago, Senator Donnelly and I introduced the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness This legislation is for those who answer that call. This bill works with the relevant Federal agencies, mental health providers, and broader law enforcement communities to offer opportunities for care.  When our police force is healthy, when it is strong, our communities are healthy and strong as well. That is why it is vital that we provide our Nation's law enforcement with the resources they need as they put their health and their lives on the line in order to protect our communities day in and day out.  This includes supporting law enforcement agencies' efforts to protect and strengthen the mental health and wellness of their respective law enforcement officers. I am confident that this bill will have a positive impact on the mental health and wellness of law enforcement officers across the country.  I look forward to the findings of DOJ's collaborative reports, the efficacy of the peer mentoring pilot programs, and the results of the Department's study into the creation of a crisis hotline for law enforcement officers.  With that said, I thank Indiana's senior Senator for his hard work in drafting this legislation and allowing for my input and those of my colleagues. It has been my pleasure to work with Senator Donnelly on this, and I look forward to continuing our work together on behalf of all Hoosiers in the future.  In fact, this legislation drew upon efforts undertaken by Hoosiers at the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police In 2010, Indiana's IMPD recognized the need to address law enforcement mental health and wellness by creating the Office of Professional Development and Police The IMPD captain, Brian Nanavaty, led the effort to establish the office and has recently promoted its motto: ``Healthy Hire--Healthy Retire: Wellness is more than just an annual physical.''  Senator Donnelly and I are proud that the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act has passed the Senate and is one step closer to being signed into law, contributing to the efforts of the  As I close, I want to recognize the leadership of a fellow Hoosier, U.Representative Susan Brooks, and her colleagues in the U.House who introduced this legislation. This bill has received bipartisan, bicameral support in Congress, widespread support from several law enforcement organizations, and, frankly, support across the country from rank-and-file Americans who understand that this is a problem we have an obligation to address. We are all with you. Now we call upon all of our colleagues in the House to act on this important legislation and send it to the President's desk for his signature.
