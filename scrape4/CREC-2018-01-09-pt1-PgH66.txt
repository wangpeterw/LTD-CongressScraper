                                DREAMERS

  (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the 
American people to information that is being kept from them. So often 
the good will and good-heartedness of the American people is 
manipulated to achieve goals that sometimes are detrimental to our 
people and detrimental to our country as well.
  Today, the American people are being told that there are young people 
who are here illegally, brought by their parents at an early age--they 
call them DREAMers--and that we must be concerned about them, as we 
are. Of course, we are concerned about them. Our sympathy is with young 
people anywhere who want a better life.
  But what the American people are not being told is that there are 
850,000 of these young people. That is being left out of the 
discussion. They are looking to be legalized. When they are legalized, 
that means they can apply for family reunification, which means that 
they then will receive government benefits and even more people will 
come in under their platform.
  I suggest that we take a look to see what 850,000 more young people 
and the millions more who will come will do to the American people.
