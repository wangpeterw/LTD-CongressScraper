                            BEWARE OF POLLS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a recent Washington Post/ABC News 
poll professed to find that a majority of Americans supported amnesty 
for illegal immigrants. That is not hard to do, given how the survey 
was conducted.
  The polsters asked to speak only with the youngest adult at home; 
over-sampled Democrats by at least 4 percent; used the word 
``undocumented'' rather than ``illegal;'' questioned illegal 
immigrants, at least 3 percent of the population; and conditioned 
amnesty on requirements that can't be met.
  Other than that, I am sure it was an accurate poll.
  Beware of polls done by liberal media organizations that have an 
agenda of their own. The American people may not be getting the facts. 
They deserve better.
