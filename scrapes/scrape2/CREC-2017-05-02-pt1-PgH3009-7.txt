                 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDING

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, President Trump wanted to cut 
$1.2 billion from the National Institutes of Health and the National 
Cancer Institute. Instead, Congress will exert its independence by 
rejecting the President's cut and will instead increase National 
Institutes of Health's funding by $2 billion.
  My community of Buffalo, New York, is home to America's first cancer 
center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Roswell Park is a national 
leader in NIH-funded research for immunotherapy.
  Immunotherapy uses drugs and vaccines to unleash the cancer-killing 
potential of the body's own immune system. Immunotherapy has the 
potential for longer remission and is an alternative to debilitating 
chemotherapy.
  Because of this congressional action, Roswell Park Cancer Institute's 
clinical trials and immunotherapy will continue, and the potential for 
tens of millions more in NIH research funding over the next 5 years is 
a reality.
  This is good for the good that it will do in advancing this promising 
research and is good for Buffalo and the continued growth of the 
Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.
