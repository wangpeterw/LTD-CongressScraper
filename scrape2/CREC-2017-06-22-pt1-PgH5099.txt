   URGING MEMBERS TO REMEMBER THE COMMITMENT THEY MADE TO ONE ANOTHER

  (Mr. WOODALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak after my friend from 
Texas. He is absolutely right. We have an incredibly vibrant fabric of 
folks across this country. My district looks very much like his 
district. I appreciate him recognizing those things that unite us and 
bring us together.
  You know, it hasn't been much over a week, Mr. Speaker, since we 
committed ourselves to changing the discourse here, and just in the 
last 5 minutes of listening to speakers on this floor, I have heard 
sinister accusations of what our healthcare bill will do, of mean bills 
and meaner bills, of cruel bills.
  Mr. Speaker, there is not a man or woman in this Chamber who doesn't 
work every day to serve their constituents better than they did 
yesterday. There is not a man or woman in this Chamber who doesn't want 
to do better for America tomorrow than we did yesterday. And I promise 
you that that pathway is not paved with accusations of ``sinister,'' 
``cruel,'' and ``mean.'' It is paved with confessions of common ground, 
common goals, and common opportunity. I urge my colleagues to remember 
our commitment that we made to one another last week.
