                    HONORING REPRESENTATIVE CHAFFETZ

  (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I stand today to honor my good friend, 
Jason Chaffetz, as he prepares to leave the House tomorrow.
  On the day that I was first elected, the very first phone call I got 
was a number I didn't recognize. I picked it up, and it was Jason. He 
was the first person to call and congratulate me. He has become a close 
friend ever since.
  But he has become more than a friend. He is a person who I trust. I 
go to him often for advice. I think he has the best political mind in 
all of Utah, and I am going to miss that.
  I also appreciate his honesty and his integrity. Leaders take hits--
we understand that--and Jason has taken his share of arrows by those 
who may not agree with his positions. But no one has ever questioned 
his honesty or his integrity.
  There is a great old movie called ``Grumpy Old Men.'' Jason will 
never be a star in that movie because he is one of the most optimistic, 
friendly, and positive people that I know. He always has a smile on his 
face.
  So for those reasons, Jason, we are going to miss you. On behalf of 
all Utahns, I thank him for his service. On behalf of millions of 
Americans throughout the country, we wish him Godspeed in his 
adventures ahead.
