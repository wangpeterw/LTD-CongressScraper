                   REMEMBERING REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Roxanne and I will be 
forever grateful for the positive impact Reverend Billy Graham has had 
for American families and the world. Reverend Graham had the amazing 
ability to digest the stories and lessons in the Bible and relay that 
information in ways that were understandable, relatable, and powerful.
  He was followed and adored by millions across the world but still 
remained humble, with his home in Montreat in the beautiful mountains 
of western North Carolina, from Grandfather Mountain to Cashiers, where 
Psalms 72 proclaims the mountain shall bring peace.
  Over 200 million people worldwide attended his crusades in over 185 
countries. In 1987, our family was grateful to participate in the 
crusade organized by Harry Dent in Columbia, South Carolina.
  Reverend Graham's accomplishments outside of his ministry were 
inspiring. In 1983, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
award by President Ronald Reagan; and in 1996, he and his wife, Ruth, 
together were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest 
civilian honor. That was also followed by the outpouring of love for 
Reverend Billy Graham, which will serve as a reminder for his family 
and staff of how much he was admired and respected.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may we never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
