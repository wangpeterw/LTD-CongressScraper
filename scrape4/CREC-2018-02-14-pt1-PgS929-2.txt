                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, the fountain of wisdom, thank You for this season of 
penance and personal reflection. Lord, as we remember that the last 
time Ash Wednesday and Valentine's Day fell on the same day--it was 
1945--we thank You for the many challenging seasons through which You 
have brought this Nation and world. As we continue to depend upon the 
power of Your prevailing providence, deliver us from majoring in 
minors. Bless our lawmakers. As they commit themselves to You, make 
them a voice for the voiceless and a help for the helpless. May they 
make it their first priority to fulfill Your purposes for their lives.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
