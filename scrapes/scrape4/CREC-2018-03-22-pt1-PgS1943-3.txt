                        TRIBUTE TO LOYD RENNAKER

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of 
recognizing

[[Page S1944]]

Darby Superintendent Loyd Rennaker for his 24 years of service to the 
Darby School District.
  After graduating from Darby himself, Loyd furthered his education at 
the University of Montana Western. With degrees to teach high school 
math and chemistry, Loyd first taught for 1 year in Malta before 
returning to Darby. Since then, he has served the school district in a 
number of roles, including as high school math and science teacher, 
elementary school principal, high school principal, athletic director, 
coach, and superintendent.
  As superintendent, Loyd helped bring high-speed internet to the town 
of Darby, providing more opportunity to students and teachers, as well 
as the whole Darby community.
  Loyd Rennaker is a wonderful example of Montana's rich heritage of 
deep community ties. He has had a great career at Darby schools and has 
loved teaching and watching students grow into successful citizens. 
After 25 years of investing in the next generation, Loyd will retire 
from the Darby School District in June.
  Thank you, Loyd, for all your hard work and service.
