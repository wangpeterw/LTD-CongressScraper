I just want to take a few moments to thank the House for the work they did recently on H.1242, and I want to urge the Senate to take action on this bill as well.  So I rise today in support of H.1242, entitled 400 Years of African-American History Commission I am a cosponsor of this legislation. I worked with my colleagues to pass this act in the House, and I look forward to the Senate also passing this bill.  I believe it is important for all citizens of the United States to recognize the unique history, sacrifices, and remarkable contributions that African Americans have made to build our great  I am invigorated by this legislative intention to identify and educate the public on the arrival of Africans and their role in building this great country. It is equally important to understand the generational impact that slavery and laws that enforced racial discrimination have had on our United  While there have been many successful and inspirational African Americans with enumerable contributions, we must address ongoing disparities in employment and education by focusing on achieving six milestones for success. These milestones include: entering school ready to learn; reading at grade level by third grade; graduating from high school ready for college or career; completing postsecondary education or training; successfully entering the workforce; reducing violence and providing a second chance for returning citizens.  I applaud the many organizations actively working to address these opportunity gaps faced by African In my community of the Second Congressional District of Nebraska, I appreciate the efforts of Willie Hamilton, president and founder of Black Men He is a true grassroots leader.  In addition, I want to highlight some other organizations and work that is ongoing in the district I serve to implement a coherent cradle-to-college-and-career strategy for improving the life outcomes of all young people. These organizations include: the Urban League of Nebraska; the START Center, that is run by my friend, Julian Young; the Omaha Empowerment Network, coordinated by Willie Barney; the Eastern Nebraska Community Action Partnership; the 100 Black Men of Omaha; the Malcolm X Foundation; the Operation[[Page H4600]]Youth Success; members of the Midlands Mentoring Partnership; the efforts of the City of Omaha through the Black Male Achievement Program, previously coordinated by Cameron Gales, another friend of mine.  Like all complicated issues facing Americans, we need this type of strong community support, along with smart bipartisan legislation to address these problems.  As the African-American History Commission develops programs, I hope they will consider inspiring communities to continue building partnerships between local organizations, government, businesses, and foundations. This will connect young African-American men and women with support networks, mentoring programs, and the skills and training they need to succeed in the classroom and in the workforce.

13302,topic-id,1220,"Mr.President, I rise tonight to join my colleagues in our fight to protect the health and economic security of the American people.  I am here to express my deep concern, anguish, and disgust with the fact that instead of working across party lines, working together to protect healthcare, instead, the majority is writing secret legislation behind closed doors--legislation that is going to make the American people pay more for less care and take healthcare coverage away from millions of American families.  I am disgusted because this issue is very personal to me. When I was 9 years old, I got sick. I got very sick. I was hospitalized for 3 months. I eventually recovered, but when it came to health insurance, it was as if I had a scarlet letter. My grandparents who raised me couldn't find a policy that would cover me, not from any insurer and not at any price. They had to pay for my healthcare out of their pockets, and they made incredible sacrifices to do so--all because I was a child who had been branded with those words ``preexisting condition.''  No parents or grandparents should have to lie awake at night worried that if their child has an illness or an injury, they will have no way to pay to cover their care. No child should have to lie awake at night hearing the whispered tones of their parents wondering how they might pay the bills to care for an ill child. It is not right, it is not fair, and it is not fundamentally who we are, but that is exactly what people were wondering last night in America, and they will do so again tonight. Families across this country will go to bed anxious and scared because of the partisan politics happening right here in Washington--the politics that is moving forward with a plan that will make things worse and not better for the American people.  This isn't just personal for me, it is personal for the Wisconsin families I work for. I have listened to them, and I am here to give them a voice.  This is personal for Jim from Appleton, WI, and for Jim's daughter who has multiple sclerosis. Jim told me that his family needs strong protections for people with preexisting conditions so that his daughter can continue to receive treatment that her family can afford.  This is personal for Greg from Stoddard, WI, who has no idea how he and other older Wisconsinites will be able to afford higher costs for their healthcare and for Greg's two sons, both of whom have diabetes and are already struggling with skyrocketing prices for insulin.  This is personal for Barbara from Madison, who is deeply concerned about cuts to Medicaid because her son has a disability and he relies on Medicaid to work and to live independently.  This is personal for Chelsey from Shelby, WI, whose daughter Zoe was born with a congenital heart defect. Right now, Zoe is guaranteed access to coverage without being denied or charged more because of her preexisting condition. Chelsey wrote to me and said: ``I'm pleading to you as a mother to fight for the . . . kids in Wisconsin with preexisting conditions that are counting on you to protect that right.''  Does the congressional majority really care more about finding 50 votes for a secret plan than it does about the health and well-being of Zoe? Sadly, it appears they do. It appears they are more concerned with finding 50 votes for any legislation, no matter how harmful it is, just so they can notch up another partisan victory and so that they can move on to other things on their political agenda. They are not listening to American families or Wisconsin families, who will be left behind.  I want to tell you what the consequences are going to be when Washington does not listen to Wisconsinites like Jim and his daughter, from Appleton, or Greg and his two sons, from Stoddard, or moms like Barbara, from Madison, and Chelsey, from The consequences are that things are going to get worse, like they do under the House-passed Republican plan.  If you are older, you are going to pay an age tax. A 64-year-old in Wisconsin might have to pay increases in excess of $10,000 more in premiums. If you have a preexisting condition, like I do or like almost 2.5 million Wisconsinites do, the guaranteed protections and care that you have today may not be here tomorrow.  If you live in rural Wisconsin, this plan will only make it harder to access affordable, quality healthcare. For some living in northern Wisconsin, this plan could cost them up to $6,000 more a year than they pay today.  Our rural hospitals are already struggling to keep their doors open, and this plan could make those challenges even worse. By the way, rural hospitals are often the lifeblood of their communities, the largest employers in many counties in which they exist. So if rural hospitals--even a few of them--are forced to close, it will not only make it harder for people to gain healthcare, it will also mean that people will lose their jobs.  If you rely on Medicaid for nursing home care or if, like Barbara, you have a disabled child who relies on Medicaid to live independently in the community, the House-passed bill cuts Medicaid and puts that care at risk. If you are one of the 35,000 veterans in Wisconsin or nearly 2 million veterans across the country who rely on Medicaid for healthcare coverage, your care will be at risk.  The House Republican proposal will both dramatically increase and shift healthcare costs to Wisconsin taxpayers and onto the shoulders of families for things like substance abuse treatment and mental health services.[[Page S3609]]It will make it harder in our State's fight and America's fight against the opioid crisis and could make the epidemic our country is facing even worse. Put simply, this plan will hand over more control to insurance companies, weaken health insurance protections, raise costs, and provide less care for the American people.  The American people cannot afford to sell a home or take out a second mortgage or home equity loan or spend their life savings or max out their credit cards or go bankrupt just to get the healthcare they need. It is not right. It is not fair. It is not who we are.  It is time to stop this partisan nonsense. The people of Wisconsin did not send me to the Senate to take away people's healthcare. They sent me to fight for people like Jim and Greg and Barbara and Chelsey and their children. Let's listen to these Let's take repeal off the table, and let's work in a bipartisan way. Let's work together to improve the healthcare people have today and make it more affordable, not more costly. Let's work in a bipartisan way. Let's work together to make things better, not pursue partisan plans to make things worse.  I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to come out from behind their closed doors to join us in this fight to stop leaving people behind and start helping them get ahead.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3608-3.txt,1558,CLIMATE CHANGE,2017.0,19.0,August
13363,topic-id,723,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, in conjunction with Representative Faso, to support the education and advancement of foster youth. I want to thank the Representative for his leadership on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal for their leadership on behalf of the Nation's foster youth.  I do think it is very remarkable, as several other speakers have said, that today we are bringing forward five bipartisan bills to improve the Nation's foster care system. Each one of the bills addresses a serious challenges or gap in that system.  H.2847, the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act, allows States to expand the Chafee Grant Program to foster youth up to the age of 23. Currently, the program ends at 21. The Chafee Grant Program provides educational grants and other services to help young people transition into adulthood and become independent.  In May, as part of National Foster Youth Shadow Day that is organized by the National Foster Youth Institute, I had the opportunity to meet a young woman named Doniesha Doniesha is from Los Angeles, and spent 20 years in foster care before she aged out. She described her foster home as abusive, and eventually she had to move several times.  Against tremendous odds, Doniesha has continued to persevere and is currently a college student at Los Angeles Trade Tech College, majoring in the administration of justice and minoring in paralegal studies.  Doniesha is just one of a small number of foster youth who actually make it to college. This is despite nearly 70 percent of foster youth expressing a desire to attend college. Those, like Doniesha, who are accepted and attend college face another hurdle, which is graduating. Currently, only 3 percent of foster youth who attend college graduate. Programs like Chafee are designed to help foster youth advance in college, trade school, and employment.  During National Foster Youth Shadow Day, I had the opportunity to speak to many other young people, and several of them described challenges that they face after--well, if they were lucky to graduate high school, where they attend college and then something happens; either they run out of resources or their housing falls through and they have to leave college, so their college is interrupted.  That is why this legislation is so important, because it allows for the flexibility; if the young person is not able to complete college in 4 years, they do have a couple of other years.  One of the things that many people don't realize is that when young people age out of the foster youth system--which typically is at 18, sometimes is at 21, depending on the State--that many times we literally put these young people on the street. They are 18 years old. They are in their foster home. They are given a bag, typically a large-sized trash bag, with all of their belongings, and they are put out on the street left to fend for themselves. With today's economic challenges, there are no 18-year-olds that can fend for themselves without a safety net.  If we think of middle class children, transitioning into adulthood is typically what happens at college. They go to college and they have housing. But if they have any challenges, they can always call home. They can text their parents. Their parents are there to rescue them in case they run out of money or something happens with their housing or their grades.  If we think of a young person out of the child welfare system who is literally put on the streets at the age of 18, you can only imagine what happens; which is why so many children in the foster care system wind up incarcerated. Many young girls wind up trafficked; and we did legislation on that a few weeks ago.  So if we want to stop what happens on the other end, with many young children winding up incarcerated, or early pregnancies, or other challenges, we need to make sure that we provide support for them early on.  H.2847 will allow the flexibility for a student, again, who might need more time to complete their education. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, to give foster youth the same type of flexibility and support that we provide our own children.

13166,topic-id,1444,"Madam President, I come to the floor today to highlight the importance of travel and tourism in our economy and also to make the point that we are welcoming of people from other countries--and we are welcoming of people in our country, as well--who want to be part, for a short time or a long time, of The travel and tourism business is an incredibly important part of the tourism economy.  Last month, I, along with my fellow cochairs of the Senate Travel and Tourism Caucus--Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Dean Heller, and Senator Brian Schatz--led the Senate in the passage of a resolution recognizing the week of May 7 as National Travel and Tourism  There are really good statistics--whether it is Missouri or West Virginia or the country at-large--on this topic. One out of every nine jobs in the United States depends on travel and tourism. It accounts for over 15 million jobs nationwide. International travel to the United States is our single largest export industry. The single largest thing where people bring money into our country is tourism to the United It generates a trade surplus of roughly $87 billion. As to that trade surplus with foreign travelers, foreign travelers stay longer, they spend more, and they like us better when they leave--virtually 100 percent of the time--than they did when they got here. Even if they thought they were going to like us a lot, they wind up liking us more. If they questioned whether they were going to like us at all, they almost always wind up on the very positive side of that question.  So it is not only a huge economic benefit of $87 billion, but it is also a huge foreign policy benefit--a huge diplomatic benefit. It is just like when students come here and go to school. They have a connection to the United States that is almost always positive. It is so positive that many of them would like to stay, with that bachelor's degree or that engineering certificate and degree, because they have liked what they found when they were here. So $87 billion is the surplus from just international travelers to the United But all told, travel and tourism generates nearly $2.3 trillion in annual economic input for our country.  In Missouri, it has been estimated that the tourism industry, which is usually right behind agriculture in the list of our top industries, provides more than $15 billion in annual economic impact and directly supports almost 300,000 Missouri jobs. When international tourists come here and spend their money at hotels, restaurants, and shops, they are not only supporting U.businesses, but they are contributing to local, State, and Federal tax revenue.  We have a great deal to offer when it comes to attracting these international visitors. We also have a lot of things we can do as a Congress to make a difference in how people travel and where they travel. We have a role to play in promoting the United States as a travel destination and in helping our State and local tourism economies be a part of that travel.  The Visa Waiver Program is sometimes questioned by some of our colleagues who say anybody can get on a plane in any of these visa waiver countries, and we particularly hear that when something bad has just happened in 1 of those 38 countries--Great Britain, France, or We hear: Anybody could come here because they don't have to go to the U.Embassy and get a visa. Except that is not how it works. That is not how the Visa Waiver Program works at all now. It does enable citizens of the 38 countries that we include to travel here for tourism and business for 90 days or less without the need to obtain a specific visa. By the way, in return, Americans go to those 38 countries without having to go to the Embassy of that country and get a visa and have an interview that allows them to travel there. So that is both ways.  Most importantly from our perspective, as to people who are coming here, the program has a lot of security built into it. For all the travelers who come, the Visa Waiver Program is administered by the Department of Homeland It works in consultation with the State Visa waivers use a risk-based, multilayered approach to detect and prevent terrorists, criminals, and other bad actors from traveling here. If you have been in some country lately that we don't think you should have been in, if you have a history of travel back and forth to countries and we have had bad experiences with people who have been in those countries, not only do you not get a waiver but you are in for a much more extensive interview than if we were trying to interview everybody from all of those 38 visa waiver countries who wants to come to the United  The President announced about 4 months ago that we were going to have a more extensive visa process in countries that need a visa, but that also can be a more extensive visa process in countries that have visa waivers, if someone requires more vetting. If someone does not want to submit to additional vetting, then they don't have to come to the United States of Those kinds of questions are easily answered  There are comprehensive vetting programs for individuals prior to the time they can get here--as well as when they get here--if they are in that visa waiver structure. So visa waiver works.  I think the visa program is working now with more extensive vetting than we have had in the past.  The program requires participants to have an electronic passport that has a chip in that passport that makes it virtually impossible to suggest that you[[Page S3355]]are somebody or to try to pretend that you are somebody who you are not. The passport is much more secure than it used to be--both our passports and passports from those countries.  In 2015, I worked with a bipartisan group of our colleagues to reform and improve this program and to secure that its robust security protocols would work as intended. We were also able to remove visa waiver eligibility for nationals of participating countries who have visited a country with a terrorism nexus, and for foreigners who participate who are originally from countries that may pose a terrorist threat. There are ways to screen that process that Americans should feel secure about. Frankly, it is a process that is getting better all the time. It is still not absolutely without risk. Travel has some risk. But thousands of people are bringing billions of dollars in tourism revenue to our economy, to see our country, and to pay our taxes. We ought to be sure we are minimizing the risk and maximizing the welcome for people we want to travel here.  I also worked with my colleagues twice now to offer a public-private partnership called Brand The United States of America, just a few years ago, was one of the few countries in the world that made no real effort to encourage people in other countries to visit our country. In 2014, Senator Klobuchar and I worked to reauthorize Brand USA through 2020. In a combination of visa waiver fees and private dollars, efforts have been successfully made to encourage people who want to be part of our economy--even for a short period of time, as a tourist. It is estimated that across all markets, each dollar of Brand USA marketing generated more than $30 in visitor spending. Let me repeat: everywhere we spent a dollar of Brand USA--and that is a public-private dollar--more than $30 came to the United States, it is estimated, because of that.  It is important for the Senate to support programs that work. Brand USA is one of those programs. The Visa Waiver Program and many others have significant, positive economic impacts on our country, on individual States, on local communities, and, by the way, on people whose business and travel necessarily take them to other countries.  Travel and tourism is one area where we have successfully worked together in a bipartisan manner. I hope we can continue that progress in this I will keep working with my colleagues to ensure that we have the right policies in place to keep Americans safe, while allowing our travel and tourism industries to continue growing and creating jobs.

13297,topic-id,1239,"Mr.President, President Trump, in his attempt to deflect focus from the 100-day performance in his administration is, today, throwing a Hail Mary pass to try to allow offshore oil and natural gas drilling to take place in very protected areas of our Outer Continental  The President's approach is unlawful and should be withdrawn before taxpayers pay any amount of money to go forward with it. He is attempting to open up coastal areas to oil and gas production, and he is touting job creation as a factor in his decision. I believe that the economic numbers revealed today show that we need to be doing more, but I doubt that this approach will be a successful approach for more American jobs.  The truth is that instead of creating new jobs, President Trump is poised to favor sectors that will compete with the already growing and thriving industries of fishing, tourism, and recreation, and in some potential areas will also threaten defense issues where we could have a potential conflict.  The bottom line is that the BP Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill was a catastrophic human, economic and ecological disaster. Eleven members of the crew were killed in the explosion, and 17 others were injured. Oil spewed in the ocean for nearly 3 months, resulting in the largest oil spill disaster in the history of the United  In the end, the BP Horizon disaster resulted in 134 million gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico; that is 12 times more than the Exxon Valdez tanker spill in 1989 in  I should say that many attempts have been made by Democrats in Congress to make sure we continue to update our laws. But Republicans have repeatedly blocked legislation that would hold polluters liable for oil spills and improve offshore safety and environmental responses.  So today it is very frustrating that the President of the United States is proposing to roll back the important safety regulations that were put in place during the Obama administration. In fact, this book right here shows the Deepwater Horizon impact that was discussed by Members of Congress, the problems we had at the Department of Interior, and asked that these new regulations be put in place.  These regulations by the Obama administration helped put a new regime into place after Deepwater But now President Trump is bringing those regulations into question, suggesting that we should roll them back. He is even questioning the new regulations on blowout preventer systems and well control, which, if my colleagues will remember, was the centerpiece of the problem with Deepwater  The blowout preventers used had not been tested; the information was not overseen and regulated properly. So after all of that damage was outlined in this report and we made sure to implement changes, now President Trump, in his first 100 days as the President of the United States, instead of coming up with a better economic strategy is simply saying: Roll back regulations on polluters as a strategy for moving forward.  President Obama had also put large portions of the Arctic and dozens of underwater canyons off the east coast permanently off limits to drilling during his time in office, using his authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands In the finalized Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2017-2022, the Obama administration removed the west coast, east coast, and Arctic waters from oil and gas exploration.  Why did he do that? He did that primarily because of the maritime economy. In Washington State alone, the maritime economy supports 148,000 jobs and $30 billion in economic activity. Many of these parts of the United States could not afford to be devastated again by oil spills or exploration into ecologically sensitive areas like the  I believe the Atlantic region was rightly removed due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, and market dynamics. The Department of the Interior recognized the potential environmental and economic impacts and competing ocean uses. For example, the economic value of commercial fishing in just the Mid-Atlantic region is worth more than $1.5 billion, and ocean-dependent tourism is more than $10 billion in the Atlantic region.  So I would say that the fishing economy, the tourism economy, and DOD's need for sea lanes in the Atlantic are all important, and we should not be trying to roll back Obama administration regulations in these areas. It is not surprising that there was significant opposition to the oil and gas leasing from citizens, local officials, and people who reside in these communities.  I can tell you, if this rule includes the west coast, there will be strong opposition from the State of Washington, the State of California, and the State of Oregon, where we are so dependent on healthy oceans and sustainable fisheries. We hope to clarify whether or not the west coast will be included in President Trump's executive order, but if it is, the west coast will speak loudly. From our shellfish growers to our vibrant commercial and recreational fisheries, and generations of families who have to have sustainably harvested Dungeness crab, salmon, and halibut.  We do not want to put them at risk with offshore drilling. Not only would a spill impact our fisheries and habitat, but it could impact our Olympic National Marine It would also have an impact on one of the busiest shipping lanes in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, in and out of Washington's busy, busy ports.  Washington's coast is a trade superhighway. Our shipping and trade economy is growing faster than ever. In the first quarter of this year, the total domestic and international container volume increased by 10 percent. In our State, this maritime economy is worth $30 billion in economic activity. It supports over 148,000 jobs, in fishing, in seafood processing, in shipbuilding, and other maritime sectors.  Because of this importance, we believe in protecting the west coast. President George H.Bush signed the first Executive order banning offshore drilling in the Pacific in 1990. We would recommend that this President follow suit.  It is so unfortunate that this new effort to repeal protections is going forward, but I believe it is going to fail. Many know that this action is just an attempt to reverse the past President's withdrawal of sensitive areas, like in the Arctic and the Atlantic, and is not authorized. It is not authorized under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and, therefore, the President should not spend money. He should go back to the people who know the law and understand that this is a waste of taxpayer dollars.  I hope the President will dialogue with Congress about any of our ideas to stimulate our economy. I am happy to talk at any point in time about ideas that we have that will move our country forward, produce jobs, and help stimulate economic growth.  But expanding offshore drilling and exploration to areas that already have been limited and set aside by past Presidents is not the way to proceed. We need to make sure that an industry that has made mistakes is held accountable and recommendations that were in this report not be reversed back to the days before Deepwater This is what we need to do to protect our vital maritime economy and make sure there are laws on the books that the oil and gas industry need to comply with.

Some people believe it is a gaping hole for fomenting terrorism and giving terrorists the ability to infiltrate our countries and do mischief here and other places around the world.  I applaud the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Missouri, for actually explaining how the system works. It is actually not just a way to enhance and promote tourism, which is important to all of our economies, it actually enhances our security if done well, done right, and done correctly. I say to the Presiding Officer, the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, I appreciate very much your making those comments today.             Resolution Condemning Recent Terrorist Attacks  I am going to do something today, Mr.President, that I have never done before. I have never come to the floor and actually read a resolution or a piece of legislation that we are going to be voting on later today. This is a resolution that came out of discussions yesterday as we were contemplating voting on additional sanctions with respect to Iran--sanctions not related to violations of the joint agreement on nuclear weapons. They appear to be in full compliance with what they professed to do, promised to do a year or two ago. There doesn't seem to be a question that they are doing what they promised to do, and that is good.  There is what we believe is an obvious violation of U.requirements that say the United Nations doesn't believe that Iran should be testing ballistic missile systems. Even though they have no nuclear weapons--we don't believe they are going to have them anytime soon; hopefully not, because that would help spark a nuclear arms race in that part of that world--we still have, along with the U.N., this prohibition against them developing and testing ballistic missiles. They have violated that a number of times, and a lot of other nations, including us, are concerned about that. We have before us this week and again next week legislation dealing with that.  My hope is that next week we will consider that legislation and have a chance to offer amendments to it. My strong hope is that we will not only be talking about our desire to see Iran fully comply with the U.guidelines but that we will also couple with that legislation sanctions dealing with This is a country that continues to make mischief in this country and countries around the world.  Today, a lot of attention was riveted on the testimony by former FBI Director Jim Comey on whether there was an attempt by the Russians to influence our Presidential election last year. All 17 intelligence agencies in this country have decided unanimously that the question is not only did they attempt or want to influence the outcome of the Presidential election--they all say yes. The answer is yes. All those intelligence agencies say yes. The second thing they said is that they feel the Russians succeeded in what they wanted to accomplish because the person they wanted to see defeated--Secretary Clinton--lost, and the person they wanted to see win--Donald Trump--won and now serves as President of the United  The issue that is going on right now in the hearings before the Intelligence Committee involve whether there was collusion between the Trump organization and the Russians during or prior to the time of the election. Ultimately, we will find out the truth, and we will let the chips fall where they may.  I think we make a mistake in simply going forward and admonishing the Iranians for testing ballistic missile weapons while at the same time this effort by the Russians to really make a mockery of our election system and change the governance of this country is a far greater threat.  My hope is that when we come back and take up these issues next week, that we will not address only the one involving Iran but that we will address in a thoughtful way the actions the Russians have taken and not let them get away with this. That is the debate for next week.  In Iran, actually 2 or 3 weeks ago, they had elections. I have spoken about this before on the Senate floor. The elections they had were Presidential elections. Here in this country, we have Presidential elections every 4 years. As it turns out, in Iran they have them every 4 years as well. In this country, most people age 18 and older are eligible to vote. The percentage of people among the electorate who actually vote is not great. Actually, for the longest living democracy in the history of the world, it is sometimes a bit disappointing. But the percentage of people who turned out to vote in the Presidential election in Iran a few weeks ago approached 75 percent, which is a good deal higher, I believe, than what we have accomplished in recent years. They have a lot of young people in that country, and the average age of the 80 million people who work there is under the age of 25. It turns out that the young people--not like the young people in Vietnam and a bunch of other countries--they like our country. They want a better relationship with our country, and the voting that occurred in Iran 2 or 3 weeks ago actually reflected that.  President Ruhani ran on a campaign that included better relations with,[[Page S3356]]among others, the United And I think the election of a lot of mayors in places like Tehran, the capital of Iran, which has changed from a hardliner who didn't agree with President Ruhani's views on this matter--they were turned out of office. That is all a very encouraging development.  There are still people in that country who don't like us, and they wish us harm, wish us ill, and they support terrorism. This is a source of concern. But, particularly with the younger people there, it is a new day there, and I think that is encouraging. We shouldn't be blind to the mischief that some in their country would create, but we also shouldn't be blind to the encouraging things happening among the young people, especially reflected in the voting. We congratulate them on actually having an election where that many people voted.  In some other countries around the world where Muslim is the principal faith, they don't allow women to vote. They don't allow women to participate in the elections, and they don't allow them to get elected. In Iran, the elections in I think Tehran, in the city council alone--women do vote in They get to run for office. I think in the city council in Tehran alone, six women were elected to serve on the city council. So that is a positive.  We commend them for having elections, and it is their job to figure out whom they are going to elect. I am personally encouraged by the turnout and the participation, especially of women, the election of women, and the President and a lot of young leaders in that country who have different view of us and their willingness to work with us and other like-minded nations in the future.  On the heels of the election, roughly 2 weeks later, there were terrorist attacks in London, in Britain, I think in Australia in the last couple of weeks, and, in the last few days, in Their Parliament was attacked. You can imagine terrorists coming in and attacking those of us who work in this building, whether they happen to be the pages or Senators or staff. That is what happened in Tehran a couple of days ago at 10 o'clock in the morning, with folks breaking into Parliament and trying to kill folks. They also attacked a sacred site--I think a mausoleum--in another part of the country. Close to 15 people were killed, and many times that number were wounded, some very seriously.  On the heels of that attack and on the heels of the election, on the heels of the attack by ISIS--in both of the attacks on Iran, the attacks were masterminded apparently by We don't know for sure given that ISIS tries to take credit for attacks they had nothing to do with or little to do with. But there are people in Great Britain who have lost loved ones, family members, friends. They are suffering, they are hurting, and they are mourning today, and the same is true of  Great Britain is one of our two or three closest allies in the world. They are like brothers and sisters to us, and we feel a special kinship and extend our condolences to those whose lives have been ended, whose lives have been shattered, and whose lives will be forever changed.  While we do that with our friends and allies in Britain who suffered from these attacks by ISIS, on the heels of a different kind of election in Iran--an encouraging election in Iran--and similar attacks by ISIS on Iran--some suggest it is because they have a willingness to actually have a better relationship with us, and maybe that is what drew the attacks by In any event, we certainly express our condolences to the good people in Iran who lost their brothers, sisters, parents, aunts, uncles, and sons, and we remember them today.  The resolution has been drafted by Senator Corker, the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, and by Senator It is a resolution that is not very long. I am going to read it. It is a resolution that dates to these attacks and mentions both countries I just mentioned--Great Britain, our ally, and Iran, with which we have had difficulty for the last 30, 40 years but which is now interested in a new day with us. To the extent that we can find a way to work together, especially in commerce, the Iranians want to buy aircraft from us. They want to buy Boeing aircraft. They don't want military aircraft. They have an airline which is just awful. It is decrepit, old, aged, and they want to buy $10 to $12 billion worth of Boeing aircrafts, passenger airlines. I would say let's sell to them. The idea is, if we would do that, we would not just put 5 or 10,000 people to work, we would provide job employment opportunities for even more people than that in this country. Why wouldn't we be interested in that? I hope we will allow that to go forward. It would be good for us and also it would be good for them, and maybe it would provide a foundation for working more closely together. I don't know if we would have the kind of relationship that we have with Britain, but as a veteran of the Vietnam war, I can state that when I go for a run some mornings--when I stay down here and go for a run early in the morning, I run down to the Lincoln I always run by the Vietnam I take my fingers, and as I go along the wall, I let my fingers brush over the names of the people with whom I served, and there are 55,000 who died in that war. They were our friends, our colleagues, our family members, people we literally served with at that time, and they are gone. Yet somehow we have been able to let bygones be bygones and develop a close, august friendship with the We are their strongest trading partner. They are buying a lot of aircraft from us these days, and we are now going to sell weaponry to them.  We are not going to do anything like that with Iran, certainly with respect to weaponry, but if we can get over finally our difficulties of war and hostilities and so forth with the Vietnamese, maybe we can someday, with a change in leadership with Iran, begin to look more toward a constructive relationship in the future.  The other thing I want to do is, I just want to take this resolution and actually read that which Senators Corker and Cardin and their staffs have worked on and thank them for their good work.  There will probably be a vote later this evening in wrapup, where there will be a unanimous consent request that this bipartisan resolution be approved. I think it is a good thing, it is the right thing, it is a fair thing. How would we want to be treated by other countries if ISIS attacks us and kills our people? We want them to be sympathetic and have some feeling for us and not be quiet about it. That is essentially what we want to do here.  The resolution goes something like this:       Condemning the recent terrorist attacks in the United      Kingdom, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Iraq, Australia,      and  It offers ``thoughts and prayers and sincere condolences to all of the victims, their families, and the people of their countries.''       Whereas since May 22, 2017, the Islamic State of Iraq and      Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for multiple      terrorist attacks against civilians that have left more than      180 dead and many more wounded.       Whereas ISIS frequently claims attacks perpetrated by      individual actors or other groups for propaganda purposes.       Whereas the people of the United Kingdom are grieving      following two terrorist attacks claimed by ISIS in London on      June 4 and Manchester on May 22 that targeted and killed      innocent men, women, and children.       Whereas government forces in the Philippines are currently      fighting ISIS militants in Mindanao, including ISIS-     affiliated fighters from the Philippines, Indonesia,      Malaysia, Chechnya, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, who launched an      assault in Marawi City on May 23 in an apparent effort to      establish a caliphate in Southeast       Whereas ISIS has claimed responsibility for two explosions      in Jakarta, Indonesia, killing three policemen.       Whereas ISIS targeted Coptic Christians in Egypt during an      attack on a bus on May 26, killing 29 people.       Whereas 22 people were killed when ISIS detonated a car      bomb at a Baghdad ice cream parlor, killing Iraqi families      gathering with their children to break the Ramadan fast, and      then detonated a second bomb killing elderly Iraqis      collecting their pensions.       Whereas a terrorist attack claimed by ISIS killed one      person in Melbourne, Australia, and wounded three police      officers.       Whereas on June 7, in an attack claimed by ISIS, at least      12 people were killed when gunmen and suicide bombers      targeted Iran's parliament and a shrine--  I believe it was a mausoleum or where one of their earlier leaders was entombed, enshrined--     in two coordinated attacks across       Whereas these reprehensible attacks have no place in a      peaceful world: Now, therefore, be it[[Page S3357]]       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) condemns ISIS' horrific terrorist attacks in the United      Kingdom, Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Iraq, Australia, and      Iran;       (2) expresses its deepest condolences to the victims of      these attacks and their families;       (3) expresses solidarity with the people of the United      Kingdom, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Iraq, Australia,      and Iran;       (4) recognizes the threat posed by ISIS and recommits to      U.leadership in the Global Coalition working to defeat       My father served in World War He was a chief petty officer. Most of my uncles served in World War II and/or One of my uncles I never met. My mom's youngest brother served in the U.He was stationed on a ship called the USS It was an aircraft carrier.  They were on duty in the Western Pacific in 1944, and their group of ships came under attack by Japanese kamikaze pilots, dive-bombing and crashing their aircraft into several ships, including the USS Suwannee, the ship on which my uncle Bob was stationed. He was 19 years old. I think he was on the ship and they were trying to launch aircraft to take on the kamikaze pilots before they could do much damage and several of the aircraft apparently crashed into the aircraft carrier on which my Uncle Bob was doing duty up on the deck of the aircraft carrier.  His body, along with the bodies of a number of people who were on the deck, were never recovered. They were killed, missing in action for an extended period of time, and their bodies were never recovered.  I told folks back in Delaware about my grandmother during one of the Memorial Day observances. I don't know if the Presiding Officer has this in Missouri, but in Delaware, during some of our observances, we have a place of honor where some of our Gold Star families sit. I told the Gold Star families at a bridge ceremony in Wilmington near the Delaware Memorial Bridge--I pointed out where the Gold Star families were sitting, and I said: My grandmother, if she were still alive, would be 110 today, and she would be sitting right over there with all the Gold Star families and mothers.  She never saw her son again after he went off to serve in the war. There was a lot of sorrow in that family for years and years and years. They had pictures for as long as I can remember. There was a picture of my Uncle Bob, age 19, posing, at the time, in his dress blue uniform.  I was a dead ringer for him. My sister and I, after we were born in West Virginia, grew up in Danville, I went off to high school and then became a Navy midshipman and then went off to Southeast I would go home to visit my relatives in West Virginia, including my grandparents. I would go back to that house. I would go back to the picture and look at him because as I grew older, the resemblance was pretty remarkable. My grandmother, from the time I was a little boy until I grew up, would always call me That was his name, not mine. I was Tommy, but she would call me It was kind of eerie. She would never try to correct it. She would just call me  Sometimes people would have nicknames for us as kids, and my grandfather always called me So we would go spend time, a week or two, with them in the summer, and my grandmother called me Bobby and my grandfather called me I wasn't sure who I was when I would go back to their home in Danville or Roanoke, VA, but I know my grandmother loved her son Bobby, and the folks who took his life were They were  In the Navy, I flew missions with Japanese forces during the Vietnam war and the Cold War when I was a naval flight officer. Japan is among our best friends today, one of our closest allies, despite the hundreds of thousands of lives which were lost in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the war that ensued.  Germany, at the other side of the world, was a bitter enemy during World War II and is among our closest allies and has been for years the bulwark in that part of the world.  I just mention them to say that the folks that might be our adversaries today--Vietnam, where I served, was a great adversary for a number of years, and today, as I said earlier, is one of our closest trading partners, and they are one of our partners. We had, I thought, a wonderful trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership should have been approved by us and never was. It was negotiated in the last administration. I think in history they will say that it was a huge mistake we made not to approve it after negotiating it over a period of several years with 11 other countries, including the  The Vietnamese are amazingly close. They love God, they love They love us more than we love us, and you can feel it. Every time I go over there, I am reminded of that.  Things have a way of changing. Leadership changes, people change, the attitudes of people toward the rest of the world, including us, will change. The results of the Iranian election give me some encouragement. I hope they give the rest of us encouragement. I hope someday some of those young Iranian people who admire this country and love this country will have a chance to come here and visit.  Ironically, today is the last day we have a lot of young people here in this Chamber who are leaving us. We call them pages. Some are sitting down here. I walked up to them earlier today. We have doors--seven doors--and when we are having votes, people and Senators come in and out, and we have two pages stationed at every door. We have pages down here at the foot of the Presiding Officer on either side. What I tried to do was just go around to the pages and shake their hands, say goodbye, and thank them for their service during what has been really, as the Presiding Officer knows, a challenging time for all of us. I would say I had to have a chance to address these pages as well as the rest of our colleagues here, but I want to say to the pages, thanks a lot for your service, and we hope you have been inspired not by our shortcoming but by the potential you see here for us continuing to send this ship of state into the future.  A lot of people are concerned about the direction our country has taken. I would like to remind them, especially these pages, that 150 years ago we fought a civil war in this country. I grew up in Danville, VA, the last capital of the I think some people were still fighting the Civil War when I got there. I was 9 years old and my sister was 10. So 150 years ago, the Civil War was fought, where hundreds of thousands of people were killed, many more were crippled, wounded, and maimed.  After that, we saw our President assassinated. President Lincoln was assassinated. After that, our President who succeeded him, Andrew Johnson, was impeached, and somehow we got through all of that in the 19th century.  When we finally made it to the 20th century, what happened? World War I--we fought it, won it, and led our allies to victory. Then World War II, we fought it, won it, and led the allies to victory in World War The Cold War--won it, led our allies to victory in the Cold The Great Depression--we fought our way out of it and led the world to a much stronger economy.  When the 21st century dawned on January 1, 2001, here is where we were as a nation: the strongest economy on Earth, the most productive workforce on Earth, a nation of peace, four balanced budgets in a row. We hadn't balanced our budget since 1968, but the last 4 years of the Clinton administration we were 4 and 0 in terms of a balanced budget.  Since the century began, we were the world's mightiest Nation--the mightiest force for justice--and we were the most admired Nation on the planet. I would just keep in mind the words of Harry Truman: The only thing new in the world is the history we have forgotten and never learned. He was a guy from Missouri, as I recall, like our Presiding  We are going through a tough time now, and we will get through it. My hope is that our pages, who have provided a great service here in the recent months of their service, will someday come back as interns, maybe someday as staff members, maybe someday as Senators and Representatives and chiefs of staff, and will play other roles in guiding our country.  We thank all of you.  My hope is that, as time goes by, the tensions around the world, the hatred, the vitriol, and the murder and the mayhem will have dissipated. Countries just like Japan in World War II,[[Page S3358]]like Germany in World War II, and like Vietnam in the Vietnam war were our bitter enemies at one time but are now our friends. Maybe we can turn the page with Iran, and they can turn the page with us. They will be better for it, and in the end, we will too.  Your generation, especially, will be better for that.  I thank Senator Corker and, again, Senator Cardin and their staffs. I thank our leadership--Senator McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer--for making sure that this resolution was taken up and written. It worked out, and we will have a chance to vote on it. I just do not want somebody sometime later--this evening or tonight--when asking for unanimous consent to adopt a Senate resolution with a certain number on it, to ask: What was that all about? I want people to know that this is about something that is important, and I am grateful to all who had a hand in it.  Thank you very much.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

13304,topic-id,2764,"Mr.President, I want to thank my colleague from Oregon for bringing the passion and the determination that he brings to his work, especially when it comes to healthcare.  I spoke earlier tonight about the potential impact of any Senate bill, but of course the impact that we know already with regard to the House bill, because the House bill is legislation that passed and legislation that we can analyze as it relates to the impact on children, especially children with disabilities.  Of course, when it comes to healthcare generally, but, in particular, Medicaid and what Medicaid provides to children, we know the impact nationwide. In my home State of Pennsylvania, we have 1.1 million children who are covered by So I am very concerned about any effort that would undermine or ultimately extinguish the ability of Americans--especially children--to have the benefit of Medicaid expansion, but, of course, the Medicaid program itself. It is especially insulting when some would support cuts to the Medicaid Program that would undermine or even threaten to undermine healthcare for children with disabilities. I spoke earlier of two children in particular.  I will come back to children in a moment, but I wanted to go to the other end of the age scale--older So many people think of healthcare for people over the age of 65 to be solely limited to Medicare, not But, of course, we know that Medicaid plays a role as well.  One of the parts of our healthcare infrastructure that may not be as well known is the impact that Medicaid has on supporting aging older adults, in particular, with regard to supports and services. We know Medicaid is critical to supporting aging older adults, providing them dignity and choice as they age. Medicaid covers long-term services and support for low-income, older adults and adults with disabilities, including nursing home and home community-based programs.  Generally, health insurance does not cover long-term supports and service costs. Medicare coverage for those services can be limited, and private, long-term care insurance is unaffordable for many So spending on long-term supports and services for older citizens accounts for almost two-thirds of all Medicaid spending. I said Medicaid, not A lot of people don't know that we spend that much in terms of long-term supports and services.  To give this perspective, in 2016, the median annual cost for a year of home health aide services was over $46,000--for home health aide services. The median cost for a semiprivate room at a nursing facility was $82,000--a much greater cost. So we know the impact of those numbers. About a third of the people turning 65 will require nursing home care at some point during their life. So these are big costs, and we have to make sure that as we move forward, we can provide this kind of care for aging adults.  Three-fourths of nursing home residents will eventually be covered by So if you are going to a nursing home and you spend down, the only option for you in most instances is We know that in about a 1-year timeframe, between July of 2015 to June of 2016 in Pennsylvania, 123,000 Pennsylvanians aged 55 and older received long-term supports and services through One group of about 80,000 Pennsylvanians received those long-term supports and services at a nursing home. Another group of about 50,000 Pennsylvanians 55 and older received Medicaid home and community-based services.  There are lots of numbers there and lots of data, but the key thing is, we know the great dependence folks have on the Medicaid Program in addition to the obvious benefits provided by So cuts or per capita caps on Medicaid would have a devastating impact on older  I know the closed-door secret discussions taking place in the Senate between among only a small group of Republicans so far--we know those kinds of discussions are taking place. What will they do with regard to Medicaid? Will they cut it outright or will they put a per capita cap on it or will they send it back to the States and tell the Governors and State legislatures they have to balance their budget: It is up to you to provide most of the Medicaid services. The Federal Government is getting out of that business or at least transferring substantial responsibility to the  So we have to be vigilant about that and make sure we do everything we can to put the interests of older citizens and the priority of taking care of them at the front of the agenda.  Research also shows that Medicaid dollars play a role in supporting a lot of good-paying jobs in a State like We are told that over a quarter of a million jobs in the long-term care field--meaning long-term supports and services--are Pennsylvania jobs right now. So any change there could have an adverse job impact. The Commonwealth Fund and George Washington's Milken Institute released a report projecting 942,000 fewer jobs in 2026 and that nearly every State would experience an economic downturn if the Republican bill were to become law based upon the House bill as we know it. As we were told most recently by a Republican Senator, the Senate bill will reflect the House bill about 80 percent. So we have a sense of the outlines of the Senate bill, if not all the details yet.  In Pennsylvania, this same report by George Washington University's Milken Institute said that just in Pennsylvania, the job impact would be 85,000 fewer jobs by 2026, and of those 85,000, more than 52,000 of those jobs would be healthcare jobs which would be lost if the Republican bill were to be enacted into law.  We get a sense of the job impact, we get a sense of the healthcare impact when it comes to cuts to Medicaid that are substantial. As we know, the Congressional Budget Office told us that were the House bill to be enacted into law, in that decade, 14 million folks on Medicaid would lose their coverage. That is on page 17 of the CBO report.  When we look at it by county in Pennsylvania, we can see the impact in this age category of 55 and up. Allegheny County--our second largest county by population--over 10,000 Pennsylvanians over the age of 55 receive care in a nursing home or at home because of That generated nearly $360 million in payments to providers in the county, a huge impact in addition to the impact on the care people receive.  I will not go through every county, of course, but just to give a sense of it. Cambria County, a much smaller county by way of population--where Johnstown is in the southwestern corner of our State--1,100 individuals in Cambria County age 55 and older receive care in a nursing home or at home because of That is about a $36 million impact on that county. In my home county, Lackawanna County, where Scranton is located, 2,500 Pennsylvanians over the age of 55 receiving nursing home care because of Medicaid, a $96 million impact just in Lackawanna I will not go through all the counties, but we can see the impact on both care and jobs when it comes to the impact of Medicaid on long-term care, support, and services.  We talked earlier about Medicaid and the impact on children. I don't think it has been at all clear until recently the reach and scope of Medicaid when it comes to children. Forty percent of every child in the country is covered by I mentioned earlier tonight, and I will say it again: Sixty percent of all children with disabilities ranging from autism to traumatic brain injury, and a lot of disabilities on that list in between, rely upon  I said the Republican plan at the bare minimum should guarantee every child with a disability who has Medicaid coverage today would in fact have that coverage going forward for whatever time they need it because I think that is part of who we are as a country. When a child has a disability that is so substantial in terms of the impact on that child and his or her family and they have Medicaid, nothing the U.Senate should do should undermine that in any way. I would hope, at a minimum, our Republican colleagues would ensure that. I think it is insulting to even create doubt or uncertainty or create any degree of anxiety for a[[Page S3612]]family to have to watch this bill proceed--either the House bill that was passed or the Senate bill which is in formation right now. For any family who has the benefit of Medicaid and has a child with a disability to in any way be anxious or uncertain because of what might happen here, I think is an insult to them and to our values as  We are a great country. We can make sure children with disabilities have the benefit that comes from the early periodic screening and diagnosis, preventive care, the quality care that comes from services provided by Medicaid for kids with disabilities. We are a great country. We can pay for that and still be a growing economy, still have the greatest military in the world, still have the strongest GDP in the world. We can do all of that and still take care of the children.  I guess some believe the only way to prosperity is to say we have to substantially cut back on Medicaid, to the point where 14 million Americans lose their coverage over 10 years, but we still, at the same time, have to give tax cuts to the very wealthy. One estimate showed the original House bill--the one that didn't get a vote but was substantially similar to the one that did get a vote--the first bill gave to 400 Americans a tax cut of some $7 million each. How does that make the country stronger when you are cutting back on Medicaid and giving gross substantial tax cuts to people who already are worth hundreds of millions of dollars or maybe even billions of dollars? I don't see how that moves the country forward to shortchange folks on Medicaid, especially if it were to adversely impact a child with a disability.  We mentioned all of those impacts, but I think it is especially devastating when it gets down to an individual family. I talked earlier about Rowan Simpson whose mom wrote to me months ago. I had the chance to meet Rowan and his mom and dad just last week for the first time in person, but the idea that Pam Simpson--or any parent--would be at all uncertain or worried about what would happen here in the next couple of days or weeks is really an insult to who we are as a people.  I hope those who are behind closed doors making decisions as we speak--maybe they are done for the day now, but I hope they will be thinking about Rowan and his mom and their family.  I mentioned the overall impact of Medicaid on children. In particular, we know the Medicaid Program, of course, in addition to covering children with disabilities, covers adults with disabilities as well. In my State, by one estimate, it is over 720,000 people. Across the country, in 2015, there were 15 million people with disabilities who were Medicaid beneficiaries. Through Medicaid, those 15 million people receive assistance with their healthcare. They get the benefit of durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs or assistive speaking devices. They get long-term supports for daily living, such as personal care attendance because of their disability. So Medicaid is now the primary payer for healthcare services for those with disabilities. It is also the primary payer for long-term supports and services that help people with disabilities live independent lives.  In many cases, these long-term care supports and services also make it possible for a person with a disability to hold down a job because of the support they get from  We know that in 2014, across the country, the average spending for a person with a disability enrolled in Medicaid was a little more than $19,000. In Pennsylvania, it was a little more than 18,300. The average annual growth in enrollee spending for persons with a disability between 2000 and 2011 was 4.5 percent. In my State, it is a little more than that almost. It is almost 5.7 percent, and we have seen the outline of a proposal that would limit that annual growth to about 2.4 percent. I would hope those who are working on the Medicaid provisions would take into account the reality of what it costs to provide help to someone with a disability and not come up with some arbitrary number to cap or limit what an individual with a disability would have available to them, especially by way of Medicaid or otherwise. They are dependent upon and have a right to expect that kind of healthcare would continue to be provided.  We will see what happens. I know those who are behind closed doors have a sense of those numbers. I hope they would be very determined to make sure no one with a disability is worse off as a result of their efforts, but that is the reality people with disabilities live with. I think when we consider what some families are up against right now, many families have just barely come out of the last recession. Some families lost their home, some families lost their home and their job or even if they lost a job and have since recovered because they are employed or partially recovered, sometimes the job they have isn't the job they had prior to the recession.  I can only imagine what it is like to have the kind of economic stress some live with because they have lost a job or the job they have now doesn't pay what their old job paid. On top of all that, if your son or daughter or someone in your family has a disability and the only thing that has kept you above water or allowed you to get from one day to the next to make ends meet is the availability of Medicaid for that individual and the family who needs that kind of help--we will see what the bill drafters come up with. Every indication so far has been very negative and very much adverse to the interests of those families--those millions of families who depend upon Medicaid for basic healthcare, especially the basic healthcare that would be connected to a disability, whether that disability is a physical disability of one kind or another or whether it is a disability because that child or adult is on the autism spectrum or whether it is a child with Down syndrome who is dependent upon Medicaid or is dependent upon some other healthcare program that would be adversely affected.  We can debate the outlines and the broad numbers of this legislation, but what I hope would not be up for debate is that those who now have the benefit of Medicaid because of a substantial burden in their life--meaning a disability because of circumstances that require one individual to have the benefit of long-term care, where the family has spent down their assets to such an extent that only Medicaid can allow that loved one to get into a nursing home--I would hope that it would not be much of a debate that we should continue to help those families and those individuals.  At a minimum, I think we can agree between the two parties that vulnerable Americans who depend upon Medicaid and other healthcare programs will be protected. I think that is something on which both parties should be able to agree. Unfortunately, the House bill in no way agreed with that assertion. That is why it was particularly objectionable, and that is why you have an array of organizations across the country that came out against the bill, those who have experience delivering healthcare to the vulnerable, those who have experience making sure people with disabilities are given that kind of help and that kind of care. If the Senate bill is substantially similar to the House bill, those with disabilities will be substantially and adversely and, I am afraid, irreversibly impacted to such an extent that we wouldn't be the same country we are today if those individuals lost their healthcare and lost the benefit of those healthcare services.  Mr.President, with that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3608-3.txt,1828,LEGISLATIVE SESSION,2017.0,19.0,June

The site that eventually became Camp Beauregard was constructed in the late 1850s as a military academy. Following the Civil War, the school was relocated to Baton Rouge and renamed Louisiana State In the early 1900s, the site became the permanent camp for the Louisiana State National Guard's annual training exercises. The site officially became Camp Beauregard in 1917 as the United States entered World War Over 44,000 soldiers trained at Camp Beauregard before the end of the First World War, and hundreds of thousands of men trained at Camp Beauregard during the Second World  Camp Beauregard is currently the largest National Guard post in Louisiana and is essential to the Louisiana National Guard's efforts to serve the United States, Louisiana, and local communities. Not only does Camp Beauregard serve as a training ground for soldiers preparing for overseas combat operations, the camp also plays a vital role during major weather events and hosts competitions and family[[Page S3916]]events. For 100 years, Camp Beauregard has served Louisianans and Americans alike.  I and my fellow Louisianans are proud of Camp Beauregard's accomplishments and the positive impact the training there has had on our State, our Nation, and across the world. I would like to thank those currently at Camp Beauregards as well as all those who have served our country there, and congratulate them for 100 years of service and patriotism.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-11-pt1-PgS3915-2.txt,1925,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1973, PROTECTING YOUNG VICTIMS FROM",2017.0,11.0,June

Now this ruthless tyrant is trying to develop long-range nuclear weapons that very soon could reach the United  Let me be clear: North Korea is a threat to the security of the United States of It is a threat to our allies. It is a threat to the world. As long as North Korea has nuclear weapons, the world is not safe.  For far too long, we have done very little to deter the Kim regime's persistent march in the development of its nuclear weapons program. That changes today.  The Kim regime's nuclear program lives and dies by its access to hard currency. North Korea acquires that hard currency from various sources. We know that China is the worst offender. But China is not the only bad actor. Terrorist networks around the world purchase weapons, technology, and training from North North Korea, in exchange, gets that money, the hard currency that it needs.  Autocrats like the Congo's Joseph Kabila have long reasoned that no one would actually enforce the arms embargo currently against North They continue to support the Kim regime and its nuclear program with no consequence.  This bill would put a stop to that. It requires that the President cut off bad actors from our financial system. No more transactions in dollars. No more using banks that serve U.customers. The Kim regime will know that we are finally serious.  I want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on this, Ranking Member Engel, and also Subcommittee Chairman Mr.Yoho and Ranking Member Sherman for their leadership.  This is critical legislation. North Korea has been getting away with murder, literally, for far too long in their own country.

13328,topic-id,522,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the African American Civil Rights Network Act of 2017, updated and bipartisan legislation that I was proud to introduce along with my distinguished colleague from Missouri's Eighth Congressional District, Congressman Jason I appreciate his leadership and true friendship as well.  Our legislation, which has already earned 72 cosponsors, would authorize the National Park Service to establish a program to preserve and protect the memory of the people and places that were significant in the struggle to securing equal rights for African Americans during the 20th century's civil rights era between 1939 and 1968.  The purpose of this legislation is to recognize, protect, and share the remarkable American story of the modern struggle for civil rights, a unique national experience that touches every American regardless of their age, region, or heritage, and yet this very American story is often left untold, without the level of honesty and accuracy that it surely deserves.  In fact, the generation now coming of age has only scant knowledge of the history of the civil rights struggle. Young Americans find it difficult to believe that racial segregation was once considered normal and necessary in the United  I truly believe that the healing potential for this legislation is essential to bringing our Nation together. The historic network that H.1927 would create would offer tremendous educational opportunities by recognizing those brave souls from all walks of life who fought to make the promises enshrined in our Constitution finally ring true for every American regardless of the color of their skin.  Across this great country, precious historic waypoints along the routes of that still largely untold story are at risk of being lost forever.  My hope is that the historic civil rights trails and the programs that will grow from this act will honestly tell the truth, the full and sometimes painful story of the struggle for civil rights, not just for African Americans, but to foster healing, tolerance, and understanding among all  This bill is similar to legislation that created the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998, which is currently administered by the National Park It directs the Secretary of the Interior to identify and create a national network of historic sites, stories, research facilities, and educational programs connected to the modern African-American civil rights movement.

13145,topic-id,421,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York, our very distinguished ranking member.  I rise today in support of H.1644, the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, an act that updates and expands the North Korea sanctions policy that was enacted just last year. It is undeniable that North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs have accelerated in recent years. In 2016 alone, the regime conducted two nuclear tests and more than 20 missile tests.  In response to this threat, the U.helped negotiate the passage of the U.Security Council Resolutions 2270 and 2231 to strengthen U.sanctions against the regime. H.1644 builds on those Security Council resolutions by expanding mandatory and discretionary sanctions and authorizing new sanctions provisions related to evasion and the use of North Korean exported labor, correspondent banking, and trade in oil, textiles, food, and agricultural products.  For example, if someone knowingly transfers significant amounts of jet fuel to North Korea, then the President could freeze that person's assets that come within the jurisdiction of the United Vessels that use North Korean ports will be banned from entering U.waters or using U.ports. The bill also establishes restrictions on the use of foreign assistance to any country that violates these provisions.  I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership and for including my amendment, which will ensure that U.sanctions against North Korea do not impede the provision of vital U.assistance to developing countries for maternal and child health, disease prevention, and response.  U.sanctions are necessary, but they are not a complete tool to address the threat of North Korea's impending nuclear development program. The U.must undertake a rigorous diplomatic effort to urge the global community, and China in particular, to use their goodwill, their leverage to enforce international sanctions and to get North Korea back to the negotiating table.  The Korean Peninsula remains one of the most dangerous flash points in the world. President Trump, sadly, I think has escalated regional tensions by sending mixed signals about the location of U.military assets, about his views, as the ranking member said, about Kim Jong-un, and about how best the United States ought to respond that we are going to disabuse ourselves of the previous policy which seems to mean the only policy left is kinetic, a military option. I don't think that makes anything better on the Korean  I thank the leaders for this effort. I think it is the right way to go. I support it fully.

Transmittal 17-33     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to          Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                           Annex Item vii       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology       1. The Boeing C-17A Globemaster III military airlift      aircraft is the most flexible cargo aircraft to enter the      U.Air Force fleet. The C-17 is capable of strategic      delivery of up to 170,900 pounds of personnel and/or      equipment to main operating bases or forward operating      locations. The aircraft is also capable short field landings      with a full cargo load. The aircraft can perform tactical      airlift and airdrop missions as well as transport litters and      ambulatory patients during aeromedical evacuation when      required. A fully integrated electronic cockpit and advanced      cargo delivery system allow a crew of three: pilot, co-pilot,      and loadmaster, to operate the aircraft on any type of      mission.       2. The AN/AAR-47 is a small, lightweight, passive, electro-     optic, threat warning device used to detect surface-to-air      missiles fired at helicopters and low-flying fixed-wing      aircraft and automatically provide countermeasures, as well      as audio and visual-sector warning messages to the aircrew.      The basic system consists of multiple Optical Sensor      Converter (OSC) units, a Computer Processor (CP) and a      Control Indicator (CI). The set of OSC units, which normally      consists of four, is mounted on the aircraft exterior to      provide omni-directional protection. The OSC detects the      rocket plume of missiles and sends appropriate signals to the      CP for processing. The CP analyzes the data from each OSC and      automatically deploys the appropriate countermeasures, The CP      also contains comprehensive Built-in-Test (BIT) circuitry.      The CI displays the incoming direction of the threat, so that      the pilot can take appropriate action. Hardware is      Software is Technical data and      documentation to be provided are       3. The AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System (CMDS)      is an integrated, threat-adaptive, software-programmable      dispensing system capable of dispensing chaff, flares, and      active radio frequency expendables. The threats countered by      the CMDS include radar-directed antiaircraft artillery (AAA),      radar command-guided missiles, radar homing guided missiles,      and infrared (IR) guided missiles. The system is internally      mounted and may be operated as a standalone system or may be      integrated with other on-board electronic warfare and      avionics systems. The AN/ALE-47 uses threat data received      over the aircraft interfaces to assess the threat situation      and to determine a response. Expendable decoys tailored to      the immediate aircraft and threat environment may be      dispensed using one of four operational modes. The hardware,      technical data, and documentation to be provide are            4. The AN/APX-119 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)      Digital Transponder is an identification system designed for      command and control. It enables military and civilian air      traffic control interrogation systems to identify aircraft.      The hardware, technical data, and documentation to be      provided are UNCLASSIFIED.[[Page S3764]]         5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the      information could be used to develop countermeasures or      equivalent systems which might reduce weapon system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       6. A determination has been made that the Government of      India can provide substantially the same degree of protection      for the sensitive technology being released as the U.

Abolish Human Trafficking Act  ",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgS3842-3.txt,1692,SALUTING FALLEN VETERANS ON MEMORIAL DAY,2017.0,29.0,April
13200,topic-id,3228,"Mr.President, I want to come to the floor to talk about healthcare, a subject I know the Presiding Officer feels passionate about as a medical doctor. But before I delve into the healthcare debate, I want to discuss briefly two important bipartisan pieces of legislation that I have been working on with my colleagues across the aisle and that are moving forward today.  I know the strange thing about this place--by ``this place'' I mean Washington, DC--is that the bipartisan work we are able to do rarely gets much attention. What gets attention in the news is when we fight over controversial topics, but bipartisan legislation that actually helps people and that gets done here is rarely heralded or even noticed. So I think it is worth highlighting a couple of examples today.  Today, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, we passed the Abolish Human Trafficking Act, which I introduced with Senator As the father of two daughters, I am always reminded of the profile of a victim of human trafficking in this country, a girl between the ages of 12 and 14 years old, who perhaps has run away from home. Who knows what the circumstances are at home? But they are looking for a better life, only to find themselves in too many instances exploited and the victims of human trafficking.  This bill reauthorizes several critical trafficking victims protection act programs that help fight the scourge of trafficking so that survivors can get the help they need and our law enforcement officers can go after the perpetrators of this terrible crime.  A vital provision of this bill is an extension of the Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund, which provides critical resources that victims need to recover from this crime. Part of the fund is financed through fines collected on convicted traffickers, and last year it provided almost $5 million in services for victims. Let me dwell on that for just a minute.  When I was privileged to be attorney general of the State of Texas, part of the job was to administer the Crime Victims' Compensation This was a fund into which fines and penalties of people convicted of criminal acts went into the Crime Victims' Compensation Fund, so we could then use grants for the victims of crime to help them recover. That is exactly the kind of model we created with the Domestic Trafficking Victims My hope is that over time it will produce more money that will be available to help the victims of human trafficking to a greater extent. That is the idea, and these are not tax dollars, so that is an additional benefit. It is actually the fines and penalties of the perpetrators that go into this fund that then help the victims to heal.  This bill also makes the Human Trafficking Advisory Council permanent so that the group of survivors who advise people like us on what additional tools are needed to combat trafficking can continue to do so.  On the preventive end, this legislation lends a hand to our Nation's law enforcement so they can track down perpetrators of the crime and bring them to justice. It implements screening protocols for the Department of[[Page S3845]]Homeland Security so that law enforcement officials at every level know how to spot trafficking victims and how to respond. This is actually a really important element of fighting human trafficking.  A few years ago, when we had the Super Bowl in Dallas, TX, I was shocked to learn that the Super Bowl is one of the largest human trafficking events during the year. That is pretty sobering and, frankly, disgusting. Training people, including law enforcement, to be able to identify victims of human trafficking, some of whom may not consider themselves a victim until it is too late, only to find themselves a victim of modern day human slavery--but being able to identify victims of trafficking so that we can get law enforcement involved and get them rescued is a big, important part of fighting this crime.  In the long run, this legislation requires the Department of Justice to implement a national strategy to reduce the demand of human trafficking by essentially putting the johns--the people who buy sex from trafficking victims--out of service. This is a cause that clearly crosses partisan lines, and it is literally a nonpartisan issue.  I am glad we are making progress on this. I am thankful for the bipartisan support of my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, as well as the Judiciary Committee members like the chairman, Senator Grassley, and the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, and many other Members on both sides who are cosponsors.                        Jobs for Our Heroes Act  Mr.President, the second piece of legislation I want to mention is the Jobs for Our Heroes Act of 2017. This, too, is a bipartisan bill that makes it easier for our veterans to get jobs in our Nation's trucking industry. The men and women in our military learn valuable skills that can easily be transferred to the private sector when they leave the military and become a veteran, and this bill is designed to help veterans transition from their military service to getting jobs in our Nation's trucking industry. This is an area that is constantly in need of trained people with commercial drivers' licenses who can work in this industry.  As I suggested, many of our military servicemembers have experience driving similar vehicles while serving in the Armed Yet for them to get a job in trucking, they are required to go through a very expensive and time-consuming training program as if they have absolutely no knowledge or job experience whatsoever, largely duplicating what they already know just because of the regulations. That doesn't make any sense to me.  The legislation that I have introduced with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth, and Thom Tillis takes into consideration the previous training and experience of veterans and allows them to apply for an exemption so they can quite literally get on the road and start working without delay.  This bill is twofold. Not only does it encourage our transportation industry to hire veterans, it helps our veterans transition into civilian life, connecting them to a well-paying job and a meaningful career. I expect the Commerce Committee to consider and pass this bill, as well, today.  These are two bipartisan examples that show we actually can work together in the U.Senate in ways that will help all of our States and the people we serve.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, there are subjects that are controversial. If there is one that sort of stands out above the rest, it is healthcare. Unfortunately, this has become all too much of a polarizing issue politically.  I happened to be in the Senate Chamber on Christmas Eve in 2009, at 7:30 in the morning, right before Christmas, of course, when our Democratic friends jammed through on a party-line vote the Affordable Care Act, now known as I remember the promises the President made at the time. President Obama said: If you like your policy, you can keep your policy. That proved not to be true. He said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Well, that wasn't true, either. Then he said: Well, you will be able to save $2,500 per family of four on your premiums. What experience has shown us is that instead of a $2,500 savings, a family of four has experienced a $3,000 increase in their premiums. That is 105 percent in the 39 States or so that have ObamaCare exchanges.  ObamaCare has been a failure if you consider the promises that were made and the promises that were broken. In experience, what we have seen is insurance companies, because of flaws in the design, literally leaving the States, leaving insured people with no option when it comes to their insurance. Perhaps they do have an insurance policy available, but their premiums have gone through the roof, as I indicated earlier--105 percent on balance since 2013. Their deductible is frequently so high that they are denied the benefit of what insurance they have because they are basically self-insured at $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, or more.  Yesterday, we announced that our work on a market-driven, patient-centered healthcare reform plan to replace ObamaCare would continue over the next few weeks. As I said yesterday, I expect that we will revisit the Better Care Act when we come back for the July work period, which is the week after the Fourth of As the Republican conference has continued our discussion on our plan to replace the failed Affordable Care Act, three things have become clear to me.  Let me start with the first one. The first one is that our Democratic colleagues are not willing to lift a finger to help. Surely, they have constituents, as I do in Texas, who are contacting them, telling them about their horror stories with regard to no access to policies, premiums that are sky high, and deductibles that are unaffordable. Apparently, they are unmoved by those stories.  As we continue to move toward a Republican healthcare solution, which is what we are left with when our Democratic colleagues refuse to participate, I want to remind my colleagues as to why we have this choice before us and why the hard work is worth it.  All of us have our stories from our States about premium hikes and lost coverage and frustration at the hands of a convoluted law, but I want to talk about the story of a young lady from Fort Worth,  She is a nurse who graduated from Texas Christian University in 2010. By her own account, she is young, in good health, and has a fulfilling career in the healthcare industry. Her first job took her to the Rio Grande Valley in South While she had to pay out-of-pocket for care, she only had a monthly healthcare premium of $71, but after the ObamaCare bill passed in 2013, she said: ``My plan disappeared.'' In other words, she was one of those who suffered from the broken promise that if you liked your plan, you could keep it, because it disappeared.  There was a new plan, but her deductible rose to $8,500. Now, I do not know many people who could pay out-of-pocket $8,500 for their healthcare before their health insurance kicked in. To add insult to injury, her monthly premium skyrocketed from $71 to $300. She is paying $300 a month for a policy with a deductible of $8,500. It is not worth very much. One year later, this plan under Blue Cross Blue Shield also disappeared, leaving her to consider the cheapest marketplace plan for $400 a month. She started at $71, went to $300, and then went to $400 a month for, what she called, a ``dismal'' policy.  Ultimately, she did find a more affordable plan for $247 a month. Yet, every year, she has seen her premium grow. She started out at $71, finally to end with $247. That is three times-plus what she originally paid, and her premium continues to grow every year.  Yet, as a nurse, her perspective is not just about herself. She cares passionately about her patients as well.  She wrote this to me:       I'm irritated, but at least I can afford it. But who can't?      A lot of folks and a lot of my patients! I certainly couldn't      if I had a family.  Doing nothing is not an option, which is why I am mystified that our Democratic colleagues have simply refused to participate in the process. For 7 years, we have promised the American people we would replace ObamaCare with something better that would include market-based solutions in order to provide care that more people could afford. This is based on a principle that, I believe, is a core principle: If people have the choice between products, they will choose the one that[[Page S3846]]is best for them at a price they can afford. Competition actually benefits consumers by providing a better product at a cheaper cost. That is what market-driven competition is all about.  To me, the choice is pretty simple. We either get rid of this failed law and replace it with real reform or ObamaCare will continue to collapse, and millions more people will continue to be harmed.  Now, this is something former President Clinton said, you will remember, during the campaign, which proved to be a little bit of an embarrassing comment when he said that ObamaCare was the ``craziest thing in the world.'' This was the former President of the United States, a Democrat, who was the husband of the Democratic nominee for President in the 2016 election. He called ObamaCare the ``craziest thing in the world'' because he knew well that no matter who won the election, whether it was Hillary Clinton or President Trump, that we would be talking about how to protect the American people from this failing system known as  Yet our Democratic friends are apparently resigned to continue to let the American people suffer rather than try to do what is right and help make things better.  The work we are left to do is hard, but it is no excuse for not trying. ObamaCare is hurting our country, and we have a chance to make it better and to right the path. I remain hopeful and optimistic because doing nothing is not an option.  Let me just conclude with this observation: What we are trying to accomplish with the Better Care Act encompasses four things.  First, we are trying to stabilize the current insurance market to make sure there are actually insurance policies available for people to buy rather than to see them flee the marketplace.  Second, we are trying to make sure we do everything we can to bring insurance premiums down--in other words, to make it more affordable--by eliminating some of the mandates that make it unaffordable right now.  The third thing we are trying to do is to protect people with preexisting conditions. The Better Care Act or the BCRA as it is known--the Better Care Reconciliation Act--maintains the status quo when it comes to protecting people against preexisting conditions. We do not want anybody who has lost his coverage to be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition when he tries to buy insurance from another insurance company. That is what happens when you change your job. That is what happens when insurance companies decide to leave the marketplace. They simply cannot afford to continue to write policies so you have to change policies, like this young lady--the nurse whom I mentioned--had to do on a couple of occasions.  The fourth thing we are trying to do is to stabilize one of the most important safety net programs in our country, which is There are three basic entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social We are doing everything we can to stabilize Medicaid because we believe it is important for low-income citizens to have access to healthcare through Medicaid if they cannot afford it through private insurance.  I want to just address some of the misinformation and, I think, outright falsehoods we have heard from some people about what the Better Care Reconciliation Act does to  I keep hearing people say this cuts It reduces the rate of growth of Medicaid, which is true. We basically put Medicaid on a budget, and we grow it year, after year, after year, as I will mention in a moment, but nowhere other than in Washington, DC, would anybody consider this a cut.  For example, in 2017, we will spend $393 billion on Now, because this is a State-Federal cost share, in my State, it is either the 1 or 2 most expensive item in our spending under our State budget each year. It crowds out a lot of other things because it is so expensive. Yet it is uncontrolled, so, in 2017, we will see $393 billion spent.  At the end of the budget window--10 years, reflected by 2026--the Federal Government will have spent, under the Budget Control Act, $464 billion. That is a $71 billion difference between 2017 and 2026. In no other alternate universe that I am aware of would this be considered a cut. This is an increase in  Now, we can have discussions--and we should and we are having discussions--as to: Is this an adequate rate of growth of Medicaid to meet the growing population and to make sure people are taken care of?  Nothing we do in this bill drops anybody from Medicaid, and the suggestion that it does is simply, I would suggest, not accurate, nor is it a cut. We can have discussions about what the proper rate of growth is, and we are having those discussions, but it is a fact, reflected by the Congressional Budget Office--which is the official scorekeeper in Congress--that, in 2017, we will spend $393 billion, and under the Better Care Reconciliation Act, we will spend $464 billion, which is a difference of $71 billion over that 10 years.  I know we will have a lot more to talk about as we continue to debate this bill. My hope is that we will have a bill that we will be able to send to the Congressional Budget Office, which will take a couple of weeks to score--that is a requirement--before we can actually bring it to the floor. I hope that at some point in the not-too-distant future, we will be able to bring a bill to the floor and have a real debate and have an amendment process that will allow everybody and anybody in the Senate to offer amendments in order to change or modify the bill.  In the end, I believe we have to decide because doing nothing is not an option. Doing nothing means consigning the people who are being hurt by ObamaCare today to continue to be hurt and to be priced out of healthcare entirely. To my mind, that is not a responsible thing for us to do.  That is why I support the Better Care Reconciliation It is not a perfect bill, but it is the next step in helping us turn our current healthcare disaster around. At some point, I hope our Democratic friends will join with us, as they have done under the two bills I mentioned earlier, for this is one of the most important things we will do in the If you think about what touches people's lives in such a personal way, it is hard to think of anything that does that more than healthcare.

We need stronger international action like this to send a message to the North Korean regime.  Our sanctions approach should be at least as strong against North Korea as it has been against Iran; and to be effective, sanctions must include all countries. Chinese trade during the last year with North Korea has actually increased. It is clear that it is shirking its responsibility. If it were to limit energy and access to hard currency reserves to North Korea, the regime would likely collapse.  Intensified sanctions of the type contemplated by this measure are particularly important because, despite all of the recent saber rattling from Donald Trump, we have no acceptable military solution. Any military attack on North Korea would result in the death of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of the 25 million Koreans in the greater Seoul area and the over 100,000 Americans that are in that region.  Only this week, General McMaster, President Trump's national security adviser, conceded that a preventive military strike would result in a human catastrophe. We cannot eliminate the risk of North Korea, but we can better manage it, and this measure is a step in the right direction.  The arsenal of our democracy is more than just our military might.

13132,topic-id,1931,"Mr.President, last week, on a bipartisan basis, the Senate rejected a bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care This should be a turning point, not just in our healthcare debate but in the way that we move forward in the  The speech given by Senator McCain when he returned to the Senate Chamber last week lasted about 15 minutes, and, in that short period of time, the senior Senator from Arizona reminded us of our historic responsibility here in the Senate and the role that we play under our Constitution as an independent branch of government, and he then exhorted us to put away the partisanship and the gamesmanship and move to what we would call regular order in the Senate: Send a bill to a committee, have the committee consider the bill, bring in experts, go through an amendment process, report it to the floor, and have another amendment process hoping that the collective wisdom of the committee and the body will result in a work product that actually achieves the goal that we set out to achieve. That is the regular order. That is what John McCain asked us to get back to, and now we have that chance.  On a bipartisan basis, I believe the Senate must come together and work on solutions to improve our healthcare system. First, we have to stabilize it. In just a few weeks, the major insurance companies are going to announce their premiums for the next year, and I am afraid they are going to show dramatic increases, because what the industry has told us over and over is that the one thing they can't calculate is the uncertainty of policy decisions. So as long as we have not done our job in stabilizing the healthcare system, they will either step away from risk or charge higher premiums to cover the possibilities of greater risk. That is what we face in just a few weeks and particularly if this administration--the Trump administration--follows what the President has said over and over in his tweets. We have listened to the President basically say what I consider to be an irresponsible thing: Let the healthcare system fail; then the Democrats will come on their knees and beg us to change it.  Well, if the healthcare system fails, it will not have much impact on the President and his immediate family. They will still have health insurance. But if it fails, many people will not be able to afford basic health insurance. They may lose it, and others may lose their coverage altogether. It could be a personal disaster--a family disaster across the board. I can't believe that anyone--let alone the President--would suggest that is the best path to a constructive outcome. Responsibility suggests that there is a better way.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million previously uninsured Americans have gained healthcare coverage, including more than 1 million people in my State of Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, our Nation's uninsured rate is at the lowest level in history. We cut it in half in Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer engage in the type of abusive conduct that was well known and well established before the passage of the Affordable Care Act.[[Page S4634]]  Before the passage of that law, insurance companies decided that women, because of their gender, had a preexisting condition and, therefore, had to pay more for health insurance than men. They used to charge older people exorbitantly more than younger people for insurance. They would deny maternity care, mental health or substance abuse care, deny insurance to people with preexisting conditions or charge them sky-high premiums. They would impose annual or lifetime caps on benefits and kick people off insurance when they got sick and needed care.  The Affordable Care Act changed each and every one of those things. Young adults, in addition, can now stay on their parents' health insurance plans up to the age of 26, and seniors with Medicare are getting free preventive care and substantial discounts on their pharmaceuticals.  The law is far from perfect. Improvements can and should be made. We have done that over the years to Social Security and We should do it again here. Six percent of Americans and 3 percent of Illinoisans purchase their insurance in the individual market, and more than 50 percent of those people receive premium subsidies to help them pay for their monthly premiums. For these people, especially those who don't qualify for subsidies, insurance options can be limited or expensive. So while there are clear challenges, we also need to be honest about the scope of the problem and where we need to make fixes. There are ways to help.  First, the 19 States that have refused to expand their Medicaid Program should do so. If they did, 4.5 million more Americans would instantly gain access to healthcare coverage. Many of these people who would gain coverage go to work every single day--sometimes to more than one job a week--and they don't have any healthcare benefits where they work. They have no place to turn. Medicaid can help. If Republicans are serious about wanting to provide people with access to affordable health insurance, Medicaid expansion is the most commonsense measure we can take.  Second, the administration should stop stoking uncertainty in the individual market and commit to paying cost-sharing reduction subsidies known as the These Federal subsidies now help 7 million Americans with out-of-pocket health insurance costs. If the Trump administration sabotages the healthcare system and refuses to make these payments, premiums on these individuals would increase by 20 percent next year alone. Now, many of my Senate Republican colleagues, including HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, support the CSR payments. I think that is a responsible course of action. In fact, they are even included in some of the Republican healthcare repeal bills. It is time to end this ``will they or won't they'' game--this uncertainty--and reassure Americans and insurers that payments are going to be made. The uncertainty is going to raise the cost of health insurance for everybody. For goodness sake, let's move in the opposite direction, bring stability and bring assurances of where we are headed so that healthcare premiums can stabilize and perhaps not go up as far as they would otherwise.  Third, we should give people in the individual market more affordable options. I support offering a Medicare-like plan. If insurers choose not to participate in the individual market, why wouldn't the government step in and offer an option that individuals can decide whether they want to take it.  Finally, we have to do something about the high cost of prescription drugs. They are contributing directly to massive premium increases. The health insurance companies tell us--in Blue Cross Blue Shield's case in Illinois, they are paying more for prescription drugs in Illinois than they are paying for inpatient hospital care--that is driving premiums higher.  What have we done to deal with prescription drug costs exactly? There is nothing in the Affordable Care Act that even monitors these costs when it comes to the public at large and very little, if anything, has been proposed or passed in Congress to deal with these out-of-control increases in prescription drug prices. I think drug companies should have to publicly justify their prices and provide ample lead time when they are going to raise these prices.  Drugs that are developed with significant Federal taxpayer dollars--and that is many of them--whether from the National Institutes of Health or the Department of Defense, should commit to reasonable pricing in their products. If these drug companies are using taxpayer subsidized research to develop a drug, I think they have a special public responsibility when it comes to the marketing of that drug to make sure the pricing is reasonable. The taxpayers helped them to a profitable position. They shouldn't go overboard and overcharge.  Last week when Senator McCain made his appeal on the Senate floor, he really called on us to work together to get something done. I have noticed that there is a bipartisan effort underway in the I believe we will hear one this week in the I am glad that we are heeding his advice. I agree with the Senator from Arizona that it is time for the Senate to turn to regular order, hold hearings, bring in experts, and really work together on proposals that would expand access to affordable health insurance coverage and care. Democrats stand ready to work with Republicans to do this. It is time to put ObamaCare repeal behind us. It is time to move forward on behalf of those who are counting on us.  I yield the floor.                   Recognition of the Majority Leader  The PRESIDING The majority leader is recognized.

Yesterday we voted to advance a well-qualified judicial nominee to serve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of  Soon we will consider one of the President's nominations for the National Labor Relations Board, and we obviously need to confirm an FBI I would hope, with all the threats facing us at home and abroad, our Democratic colleagues would not launch the first filibuster of a nominee to be FBI Director, especially one who was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote to 20 to 0. These are just a few of the many nominees who need to be acted upon and quickly.  Up until now, our friends across the aisle have thrown up one unnecessary procedural hurdle after the next on even the most uncontroversial of nominees. As a result, I noted last month that at the pace we were going, it would take more than 11 years to confirm the remaining Presidential appointments. Well, that pace has slowed even further. Now it would take 12 years.  It is time to end this.  I look forward to our Democratic colleagues cooperating with us to do that so the Senate can spend its time considering other things that are important to our constituents. We have legislation to address over the remainder of this work period as well. Our veterans deserve the best care the country can provide. Under the last administration's VA scandal, the veterans were let down in a big way. Congress came together in the wake of that scandal to pass the Veterans Choice Program, which allows many veterans to skip the long wait and travel times at some VA facilities and access private care.  The House recently acted to shore up this program on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, 414 to nothing. Now the Senate needs to act as well.  We also need to renew the FDA User Fee This program is critical to speeding up the drug approval process, and that is important to everyone frustrated by the time and costs of bringing lifesaving drugs to market. Without it, the important work of ensuring that drugs and devices are safe and effective would literally come to a screeching halt. Every 5 years, these agreements need to be reviewed and reauthorized. The Senate legislation to do so was reported by the HELP Committee on a 21-to-2 bipartisan vote, and given the lifesaving developments in immunotherapy and personalized medicine on the horizon, it is more important than ever.  We have important work to do over the remainder of this work period. I hope colleagues will cooperate across the aisle in our efforts to do so.[[Page S4635]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-08-01-pt1-PgS4633-6.txt,326,KOREAN INTERDICTION AND MODERNIZATION OF SANCTIONS ACT,2017.0,1.0,April

13136,topic-id,977,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and let me start by thanking our chairman on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce from His personal commitment to this important issue is reflected by his long track record and leadership in crafting the legislation before us today. We have had innumerable talks about North Korea and the threat through the years. Ed Royce has always been there at the forefront in this very important issue.  I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of the bill. We stand on the floor today speaking in a unified, bipartisan voice about the threat that North Korea and the Kim regime pose to the United States, to our friend and allies, and to peace and stability across the globe.  Already, Mr.Speaker, North Korea poses a potentially catastrophic danger to our closest allies in Northeast Asia: Japan and South With each passing day, the reclusive regime in Pyongyang continues to make progress on nuclear and ballistic missile technology that could reach American soil.  This isn't a laughing matter. This isn't a matter about something that might happen. This is a matter about something that will happen, unless we take steps to prevent it from happening.  American administrations of both parties have tried and failed to curb the dangerous behavior of the Kim regime. Before Kim, you had his father and his grandfather before him. There is plenty of blame to go around for how we got here, but rehashing past mistakes won't get us anywhere. Instead, the United States and other global powers need to focus on this challenge before it is too late.  However, I fear that the administration's inconsistency in recent weeks has thrown fuel to the fire. We have seen the White House blow hot and cold on the potential for talks with We have seen careless rhetoric alienate South Korea, a critical ally whose partnership is essential in trying to contain North  One week we see saber rattling toward North Korea, including the false claim that an aircraft carrier battle group was headed toward the Korean Peninsula, and the next week, the President saying he would be ``honored'' to meet with ``smart cookie'' Kim Jong-un, the latest in a long list of totalitarian strongmen who seem to have won the President's admiration.  We are sending mixed signals, Mr.Speaker, and the world is taking notice. Inconsistency on national security matters is not a foreign policy strategy that will succeed. When America appears confused or unmoored, it emboldens our adversaries and gives our friends and allies pause. When we are talking about nuclear weapons, there is simply no margin for error.  Fortunately, in this Congress, our priorities are clear: work with China and our close partners in the region and dial up pressure on the Kim regime to return to the negotiating table.  Last year, under Chairman Royce's leadership, we passed a sanctions bill that President Obama signed into law.  Kim Jong-un is exceedingly crafty: his regime is becoming increasingly effective at invading international sanctions.  When we make sanctions tougher, they come up with new ways to get around them: phony bank accounts, fake companies overseas, shipments under foreign flags.  We need to go back to the well to close the loopholes that the regime exploits. That is what this measure does. It dials up sanctions on those who do business with the Kim regime, hopefully, making them think twice before providing cover to one of the most brutal human rights abusers in the world and the nuclear ambitions of the leader of that country.  If you buy certain materials like metals or minerals from North Korea, if you sell fuel that the North Korean military can use, if you have a role in maintaining overseas bank accounts or insuring the ships Pyongyang uses to evade the law, then you are going to get caught up in these new sanctions.  If you ignore the U.N.'s limits on important North Korean coal or iron, or try to buy cheap textiles or fishing rights from the government, or help the Kim regime conduct business online, you will be subject to additional scrutiny with this legislation.  With this bill, we will target those who use North Korean forced labor, a gross human rights abuse and a cash cow for the regime. We will consider limiting certain types of assistance to countries buying or selling American equipment to  In light of the recent public assassination of Kim's half brother, and other nefarious activities, we require the State Department to take a hard look at whether North Korea should be put back on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list.  The Kim regime must be made to understand that we will not back down in our effort to cut off support for its dangerous activities. Every time they cut another corner, we will put up another roadblock. We will come after them again and again until they realize there is no option but to sit down and negotiate.  As we have seen, it won't be an easy process. Making real progress on complex global issues rarely is. Reckless threats and bombastic talk usually make matters worse, especially when you are dealing with an unpredictable and impulsive leader.  The stakes are very high. No one wants to see war on the Korean Peninsula, least of all the 25 million people in Seoul and the nearly 30,000 United States troops who are in Pyongyang's sights every single day.  We need to remain focused, with clarity of purpose, in order to get the results we all want. This bipartisan bill builds on our record in the House of grappling with this challenge.

One of the things I have been most proud about as the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee is the collaborative work that the chairman and I have done together in passing so many bills with both our names. It is what the American people want us to do, and I think the Foreign Affairs Committee is a great example of how the American people want Congress to work together. This bill is exactly a product of that, of working together.  If we want to pressure the Kim regime and if we want to prevent a potentially devastating conflict in Northeast Asia, we cannot be impulsive. The risks are too high. We need a strong, focused, and consistent policy. We need[[Page H3037]]strong measures that cut off support for the Kim regime and careful diplomacy to bring the relevant players together. This bill represents an important part of such a policy.  So, again, as I said, I am glad we are advancing this measure with strong bipartisan support, and I hope the other body will take up this legislation soon.

13286,topic-id,609,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that the House can vote on my bipartisan legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency  Mr.Speaker, in the last week, the President fired the FBI Director who was investigating him. We then learned that the President also pressured the Director to end his investigation of Michael Flynn's Russia entanglements. These revelations, added to so many others, make it abundantly clear that we must have disclosure of the President's tax returns in order to fully understand his connections to The Presidential Tax Transparency Act would require this disclosure for the current President, all future Presidents, and Presidential nominees.                              {time}  1245  This practice has never been required by law. But if there were ever a time for Congress to codify this bipartisan disclosure tradition, now is the time.  The President's behavior has raised questions since before the election about what connections or exposure he may have to Russian officials. After the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA concluded that Russia did, in fact, interfere in our national elections; after several of the President's associates and staff lied about meetings with Russian officials during the campaign and transition; and after the FBI opened an investigation into these Russia contacts, the President still welcomed top Russian diplomats into the Oval Office for a closed-door meeting last week.  Holding the meeting itself raised many questions. But in the meeting, the President revealed highly classified, code-word information to the I believe that this is unprecedented. No President in the history of our country has ever done such a thing.  And on May 16, The New York Times reported that the President pressed the former FBI Director Jim Comey to end his investigation of Michael Flynn's ties to Russia before he fired him. This all begs the question: Why is the President so eager to please the Russians?  The appointment of former FBI Director Mueller, a highly distinguished public servant, as special counsel is most welcome. But I believe that Congress can act today to provide public disclosure of the President's tax returns, which would provide an immediate and important window into the President's potential Russian entanglements, and answer the critical questions of: To whom does he owe money? And who is the President doing business with? What are those entities?  We know there are 564 of them. The American people deserve to know. Only with full disclosure will we know the true sources of the President's income, the holders of his debt, and the extent of any business ties to Russia and other foreign countries.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is a highly serious, bipartisan--I want to stress that--bipartisan effort to exercise Congress' constitutional duty to serve as a check and balance on the executive branch as a coequal branch of government.  As the former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on May 14:       Our institutions are under attack, both externally . . .      and internally.  I want to thank all of the cosponsors of this bill and, most especially, the Republicans who have had the courage to do so. It takes courage to have courage. Now is the time to stand up and demonstrate courage so that the American people will have confidence--confidence in what takes place here and to answer the questions that are left unanswered.  So by defeating the previous question today and voting to approve the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, Congress can create a pathway to the facts, and then the truth, that the American people have a right to know.

13258,topic-id,654,"Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from the great Virgin Islands, and I really appreciate her leadership.  I would like to thank my colleagues for bringing forward such an important topic for tonight's Special Order hour. National security is an issue of utmost importance to all of us.  The bottom line is this: If the President thinks it is okay to share classified information with our adversaries, we have a big problem. I will be reemphasizing that point: If the President of the United States of America shared classified information with our enemies, then the lives of the American people are at risk.  Regardless of political party, if, in fact, President Trump did willingly share classified information with Russia, then this further proves that the President does not understand the consequences of his actions. It proves that he doesn't understand how much we stand to lose as a result of these actions.  The bigger question now that people are asking is: Do you think the President is in so much trouble?  It is clear from the news that the Russian investigation is the gift that keeps giving. But I want to be really, really clear with you. I did not vote for President I did not support him when he was running, and I fought hard to stop President Trump from becoming elected.  If you want to know, I think the President is in trouble. I will tell you this. President Trump and his administration are not ready for prime time. The campaign is over. The President needs to focus on governing, and we have not seen him do that yet. He needs to learn how to govern.  We know that the Comey firing has sent a potential signal of the President's collusion with For this reason, I called for the special prosecutor and the independent commission so that the American people truly can know the Trump-Russia connection.  I am glad to see former FBI Director Bob Mueller named as special counsel to oversee the investigation, but we still need to make sure that Congress is able to conduct an independent investigation into the Trump administration's ties to Russia and interference in the 2016 election. The American people deserve to know the facts. The American people deserve to know the facts.  I was in my district over the weekend in Lower Merion, and all anyone asked to talk about was Comey and They want answers, and they want to get to the bottom line of this.  I want to, but what I want to do is to raise the dialogue on the issues that really matter here, the issues that we really have a lot to lose on. For example, last week, I hosted a briefing on middle neighborhoods. Middle neighborhoods are neighborhoods caught between bust and boom. They are communities doing just well enough that our cities aren't focusing our resources or attention on them.  Of course, we need to get to the bottom line of collusion between Russia and the I want to, and we will get to the bottom line of this as the American people deserve the facts. At the same time, I want to make sure we are fighting for dialogue on the ways we can make a difference and make an impact on our communities in need.  We need to find ways to tackle food insecurity, help our public schools, and expand access to capital and credit on every corner to build stronger neighborhoods block by block. This will not be easy. We need to work together. It is in our collective interest to ensure national security is not a partisan issue. It should be a bipartisan issue.  So I stand here in the well of this House, Madam Speaker, to indicate that I want to ensure that national security is important. I hope, Madam Speaker, that the President also understands that it is important.

13235,topic-id,2412,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of Officer Miosotis  Officer Familia was a member of the New York City Police Department's 46th Precinct in the Bronx who lost her life in the early hours of July 5. She was targeted by a deranged ex-convict who assassinated her in cold blood.  As New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill said at Officer Familia's funeral: ``Everything our government stands for--freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear--everything starts with public safety. Miosotis knew this, and she wanted all of to us play our part.  ``That is why violence against police and what we represent is a dishonor to civilized society.''  With a renewed dedication to law enforcement and the communities they serve, we pledge to keep Officer Familia's legacy alive.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record Commissioner O'Neill's remarks.     Remarks by Commissioner O'Neill for Officer Familia's Funeral       Good morning everybody.       Barbara [NYPD Chaplain Barbara Williams-Harris],      I'm not sure if I'm ready to celebrate yet. I have to work on      it.       Members of the NYPD Chaplains Unit; Pastor Davidson and the      staff and congregation of World Changers Church--I love the      name; Mayor de Blasio; Adriana, Gennie, Peter, Delilah;      Inspector Phil Rivera and all the men and women of the 4-6      Precinct in the Bronx; law enforcement officers from all      across our nation and the world, many of whom traveled great      distances to support us in this time of incredible sorrow;      and all other friends and family gathered here this morning:       On behalf of the entire New York City Police Department, I      extend our most profound condolences.       Police Officer Miosotis Familia was a kind and authentic      woman.       One of 10 children raised in Washington Heights before she      and her family moved together to the Bronx, she was serious      but sharp-witted. And though she was the youngest, her      siblings say she was never spoiled.       Miosotis was the glue that held her large family together.      She would mediate any dispute, especially among her six      feisty sisters. Known as a lovable goof, they playfully      called her ``La Loca,'' or Crazy       And later, as a mother, she would teach her own children      life lessons--like being kind to strangers, blessing others      with a smile, and respecting those less fortunate.       I'm told that Valentine's Day was her favorite holiday.      She'd really go overboard with the hearts and the decorations      in their Kingsbridge apartment, just so the kids could see      all the love that was theirs.       Like every New Yorker, Miosotis just wanted to do her job,      work hard, live without fear, improve her life, and the lives      of 86-year-old mother, her two daughters, and her son.       But she also wanted to do something else: She wanted to      improve the lives of other families, as well. When she made      that decision 12 years ago to become an NYPD cop--a Bronx      cop--she epitomized why many people choose to become police      officers.       Gennie, Peter, Delilah: I can talk forever about the great      things--the fantastic things that police officers do every      single day for millions of people--but nothing I can say will      bring your mom back. I'm sorry for that.       But I can make you this promise: Your mom didn't die in      vain. Your mom's legacy will never fade from importance or      memory.       Your mom made it her mission to make your home--New York      City--a better and safer place for everyone. And I vow to you      we will continue to find our way forward in her honor.      Because that's what cops do.       Cops are regular people who believe in the possibility of      making this a safer world. It's why we do what we do. It's      why we run toward, when others run away.       Your mom believed in the possibility of being part of      something larger than herself. She accepted the vast      responsibility that came with her decision, knowing that it      would be challenging, recognizing that someone has to do this      job, and believing she was willing and able to fill that      role. And she was right.       Miosotis wanted other people to know her, to work with her,      and to help her make this a better city for all of us.       Everything our government stands for--freedom of speech,      freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear--     everything starts with public safety. Miosotis knew this, and      she wanted all of us to play our part.       That is why violence against the police and what we      represent is a dishonor to civilized society. We should be      outraged that any single person had so little regard for your      right to public safety.       On the night our nation celebrated its independence, the      coward who committed this atrocity did not walk down the      street after midnight and shoot just anybody.       He shot a cop.       Mental illness and medication may have played a part--I      don't know. What is certain, however, is that he hated the      police. He saw us as the ``bad guys'' because countless times      he heard it in conversation, saw it on television, read it in      the newspapers. Combine that toxic blend with his special      brand of evil, and you get . . . this funeral.       Hate has consequences. When we demonize a whole group of      people--whether that group is defined by race, by religion,      or by occupation--this is the result. I don't know how else      to say it: This was an act of hate, in this case, against      police officers--the very people who stepped forward and made      a promise to protect you, day and night.       This amazing woman, this mother, this daughter, this      sister, this friend, this New York City police officer, was      assassinated solely because of what she represented and for      the responsibility she embraced.       All her killer could see was a uniform, even though      Miosotis was so much more. He blamed the police for his own      terrible choices in life. And for the way he emerged after      our society agreed he should go away to prison for a while.       As a city, and as a country, I don't believe we're in the      same place we were at the end of 2014, when Detectives Rafael      Ramos and WenJian Liu were assassinated under similar      circumstances in We are on firmer ground now, with      police and communities working more effectively together.       But in mid-2017, there unquestionably is a creeping apathy      among the public about the work and role of its dedicated      police officers. I think of it this way: You don't really      notice the lights are on . . . until they go out. If we do      wrong, we are vilified. If we do right, we are ignored.       There is little attention paid to positive changes in      policing, in general, and in this police department, in      particular, no matter how effective they may be.[[Page H6136]]       But the manner in which Miosotis was killed should remind      everybody that the civility of our society balances on a      knife's edge. And the 36,000 uniformed members of the NYPD      are just regular people who made a selfless decision to help      maintain that balance.       There is nothing more human than a 48-year-old mother of      three, living in the Bronx, who decided to swear an oath, put      on a uniform, and live a life with meaning. Fighting crime      and keeping people safe is not a responsibility that the      police take lightly, and neither should the public.       While crime continues to go down, year after year, that      provides little comfort when the fabric of our society, the      blanket of public safety we provide, is torn by a senseless,      direct assault on one of our protectors.       Here are the numbers we don't talk about nearly enough:       Since our start in 1845, more than 840 New York City police      officers have died in the line of duty. Miosotis is our      seventh cop to be shot and killed in just the last five      years. And she's our third female officer ever to be murdered      on the job.       Across our nation, 135 police officers were killed in the      line of duty last year, the sharpest spike in the last five      years. And just yesterday, New York State Trooper Joel Davis      was killed in the line of duty while responding to a radio      run of a domestic dispute in upstate New       Each of these murdered officers has one thing in common:      They lost their lives while protecting the lives of others.      Some people say: ``Well, that's what cops signed up for,      right? That's their job.''       Let me tell you something: Regular people sign up to be      cops. They sign up for this job of protecting strangers,      knowing there are inherent risks. But not one of us ever      agreed to be murdered in an act of indefensible hate. Not one      of us signed up to never return to our family or loved ones.       So, where are the demonstrations for this single mom, who      cared for her elderly mother and her own three children?      There is anger and sorrow, but why is there no outrage?      Because Miosotis was wearing a uniform? Because it was her      job?       I simply do not accept that.       Miosotis was targeted, ambushed, and assassinated. She      wasn't given a chance to defend herself. That should matter      to every single person who can hear my voice, in New York      City and beyond.       We know there's evil in this world. That's why we need the      police. But as New Yorkers, we can decide that people like      Miosotis' killer will ultimately fail. He will not drive us      apart. We can decide to come together and make our city      reflect the good inside all of us, the hopes and simple      dreams we share.       I'm asking the public to make a commitment to support your      police, to work with us. Commit to watching the backs of      those you call when you're scared, those you call when you're      in trouble.       NYPD cops answer about four-and-a-half million radio runs a      year, and are flagged down countless other times. AnAfor good      or bad, only a tiny handful of our actions make the news.      That tiny handful--some when things go right, others when      things go wrong--because that's what sells newspapers--those      are the ones that define us. And the millions--literally      millions--of our other actions go unnoticed.       But we don't turn away from criticism, because we know it      comes hand-in-hand with the possibility of making the safest      big city in America even safer. We know you need us. And we      need you. We want all our neighborhoods to be safer places      for our children, for our elderly, for ourselves.       But without peace and safety, we have nothing. It's a      shared responsibility. You must participate. You must not      retreat.       It seems that we put all our societal failures on our      police to solve. If there's not enough drug addiction      funding, many say it's the police who should change their      tactics. If there's not enough money for mental health, many      say it's the cops who need to alter what they're doing out on      the streets. If our society hasn't adequately invested in      schools, the cops need to figure that out.       We tell our police: ``You're the counselor, you're the      parent, you're the social worker, you're the referee.'' But      policing was never intended to solve all those problems.       It's our obligation to continually drive down crime and      keep people safe. That's what Miosotis vowed to do. And      that's the work we vow to continue in her stead.       What we are left with are the memories, moments shared,      lives touched, friendships forged. There is no making sense      of what is truly senseless. There is no explaining the      unexplainable. Words do not do it justice. We cannot fix the      hurt. We have to put that in the hands of a higher power. And      the higher power I'm talking about is you.       We need the public to take a more-active role in our city's      safety. I'm asking you to connect with your police. Listen to      my words: Your police. We are yours. We're here to help.      We're here to make things better. But we nee your assistance.      We need it now, more than ever. Because no one knows what's      going on a street, or a block, better than those who live and      work there every day.       That's how your neighborhoods will keep getting better. And      that's how we're going to continue to keep driving crime down      and keep everybody safe. And that's how we'll find our way      forward, together. That's Miosotis' legacy.       The pain we feel today will not soon pass, but we know she      did not die in vain. Our anger can be transformed into      effective change. Our sorrow can make us a better society. We      may not ever match the sacrifice made by Miosotis, but surely      we can try to match her sense of service. If we cannot match      her courage, we can strive to match her devotion.       In the last few days--the 4-6 Precinct, Police Plaza, all      across New York--we've received many, many messages of hope      and support. They tell us that people around the nation and      around the world love the police very much, and mourn with      us. They tell us they need us, and that they are proud of us.       I, too, couldn't be more proud of our cops.       To the men and women of the NYPD who bravely put on that      uniform every day--and they do, it takes courage--and to all      those who have come before us: Thank you for your dedication,      your leadership, and your powerful example.       And I also couldn't be more proud of--and thankful for--     Miosotis, whom I promote today to Detective-First      Please rise and applaud her life and service.       To Gennie, Peter, and Delilah: Here we are, today,      literally surrounded by a sea of blue as far as the eye can      see outside this building. And know this: Our family will      always be with yours. We don't ever forget. We will always be      here for you and this city.       And to all the members of the NYPD: Do not ever forget why      you chose to become a police officer. Be proud of who you are      and what you do. Always remember that Miosotis lived to      protect all New Yorkers, and her legacy protects us still.       We pray that she now finds rest, and that her beloved      family finds solace and peace and the strength to live the      lives their mother fought to give them.       God bless God bless her family. God bless every      member of the New York City Police Department, who will      forever carry on her most important work.       Thank you.

13236,topic-id,503,"I also include in the Record my full statement. May God bless Officer Miosotis Familia's memory.  Mr.Speaker and my colleagues, today I rise to honor the memory of Officer Miosotis Officer Familia was a member of the New York Police Department's 46th Precinct in the Bronx who lost her life in the early hours of July 5th. She was targeted by a deranged ex-convict who assassinated her in cold blood. All of New York was affected by this evil act. The 48-year-old loving mother devoted her life to helping others. Sadly, she becomes the third female NYPD officer to be murdered on the job; the first in New York since 9/11.  Officer Familia had two daughters and a son. She wanted to leave them a better future, a safer city. Every one of the 36,000 uniformed members of the NYPD goes to work every day for this vision. They sacrifice. They risk bodily harm, and worse. Too often they do so despite a hostile media and an indifferent public. As New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill said about her, and all law enforcement personnel, at Officer Familia's funeral: ``Cops are regular people who believe in the possibility of making this a safer world. It's why we do what we do. It's why we run toward, when others run away.'' He remarked, furthermore, ``Everything our government stands for--freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear--everything starts with public safety. Miosotis knew this, and she wanted all of us to play our part. That is why violence against the police and what we represent is a dishonor to civilized society. We should be outraged that any single person had so little regard for your right to public safety.''  Through it all, Officer Miosotis Familia carried love in her heart: love for the Bronx neighborhood she patrolled; love for the people of her city and state; and love for the oath she swore all those years ago when she made the decision to enter law enforcement: To serve and protect.  Her killer--and I refuse to mention his name--was driven only by hate. This is the hate which in 2016 resulted in the sharpest spike in police killings in five years. It is the hate that robbed three children of their mother with a single gunshot on a dark Bronx street. I want to share with this Chamber a recollection by Officer Familia's oldest daughter, delivered at her funeral. She said that Miosotis came into her room on July 4 before going to work, a regular person believing in the possibility of bringing about a safer world.  She said, ``I'm going to work now.

13111,topic-id,796,"Mr.President, I wish to introduce a Senate resolution to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest.  On March 3, 1991, an African American named Rodney King was driving on a Los Angeles interstate when officers attempted to pull him over for allegedly speeding. By the time he pulled over and exited his car following a high-speed chase spanning 8 miles, there were multiple LA police department units on the scene.  King was tasered two times, and camcorder video footage recorded by a civilian witness--George Holliday--from his nearby apartment balcony depicted the brutal beating of King by four officers who surrounded him. The officers struck King repeatedly until he was bloodied and disfigured with a fractured cheekbone, 11 broken bones at the base of the skull, and a broken ankle. The video footage shows King being struck by batons over 50 times,  Holliday's video was sent to news outlets and aired around the world. It shook the Nation and raised outcries about excessive force by police officers. But even before the videotape had become public, community leaders in Los Angeles had highlighted on numerous occasions the use of excessive force by LAPD officers.  In fact, in the immediate aftermath of the Rodney King beating, then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley formed[[Page S2629]]the Christopher Commission to thoroughly examine thousands of excessive force complaints made against LAPD officers in the late 1980s. So when--a year later on April 29, 1992--the four LAPD officers caught on tape were acquitted after standing trial for using excessive force against Rodney King, the entire Nation was in shock. The verdict appeared completely incompatible with the brutal videotape footage that flooded our TV screens at the time.  When the verdict became public, hundreds gathered at the Los Angeles County Courthouse to protest, and a national debate immediately began over racial injustice and excessive use of force by police against racial minorities. Shortly thereafter, at the intersection of Florence and Normandie in South Central Los Angeles, the public's frustration boiled over and violence erupted, setting off a flash point that the police simply could not quell. Looting, vandalism, and physical attacks became rampant, and I will never forget the image of Reginald Denny being dragged out of his semi-trailer truck to be severely beaten in the middle of the street.  From then on, the unrest overtook the city, including neighborhoods like Koreatown, Hawthorne, Compton and Long The city, quite literally, was on fire. For 6 days, the city was in a state of emergency.  All told, there were more than 60 individuals who lost their lives amid the looting and fires, and thousands of individuals were injured or arrested, while countless more lost their businesses and places of employment. Over 3,600 fires were set and over 1,100 buildings in Los Angeles were damaged or destroyed.  Images of the smoke clouds over the city evoked the devastation felt by so many The 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest was felt so deeply and so personally by so many communities throughout the city.  The African American community decried not only the verdict returned against Rodney King but also mourned the death of high-schooler Latasha Harlins and so many other victims of violence and excessive use of force. The civil unrest was symptomatic of the deep frustrations felt by the African-American community against a criminal justice system that continually failed to protect them.  Similarly, the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest was sharply felt by the Latino community in Los  According to one report following the unrest, one-third of those killed and half of those arrested were Latino, and countless Latino businesses were looted or destroyed.  The Korean-American community in Los Angeles was also deeply impacted, referring to the unrest as ``Sa-I-Gu,'' to commemorate the date ``April 29'' in Korean to mark it as a significant date in Korean history. Amidst the torched and decimated businesses, 35 to 40 percent of the property damage was suffered by those businesses owned by Korean-Americans--with estimates of up to 1,600 Korean-American-owned stores completely destroyed.  There is no question that those fateful 6 days have impacted generations of We must resolve to never forget the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest and what emerged from those fires.  We must offer our condolences for the families who lost their loved ones or who bear the scars, both mental and physical, from that time and commend those who have worked so hard to come together to heal community rifts, rebuild a stronger Los Angeles, and continue to promote ongoing dialogue, civility, and unity among all communities.  That is the purpose of this resolution we are introducing today.

13244,topic-id,558,"Mr.Speaker, it is good news that the jobless rate has dropped to 4.3 percent, the lowest level in more than a decade. However, we still face tough challenges in building an economy that supplies employers with the talent needed to be competitive and in educating workers with the skills needed for success in today's economy.  Because our economy increasingly requires a more skilled workforce, the next generation of workers needs education beyond the traditional high school degree to find good-paying jobs that enable them to move up the career ladder and firmly into the middle class.  To solve these challenges, we need a strong demand-driven workforce development system that aligns education with the needs of employers. That is why the Committee on Education and the Workforce, which I am proud to chair, recently advanced, with unanimous support, legislation that will strengthen skills-focused education and help equip more students with the skills they need to achieve success.  However, the real solutions lie outside of That is why I am pleased the private sector is leading the way so that workers in industries have the skills to compete and prosper in the global economy.  I want to commend companies like JPMorgan Chase, Toyota, IBM, Boeing, and so many others for their commitment to creating public-private partnerships aimed at closing our skills gap and helping America's employers and workers succeed.  Recently, I had the opportunity to join a roundtable discussion with workforce development experts from a wide array of nonprofits, educational institutions, and workforce development leaders. They are working with employers to build sustainable and robust pipelines of talent to fill growing needs in critical sectors, such as healthcare and technology.  Communities across the country are looking to power their businesses with talent from their local communities, and they are doing this by developing partnerships that focus on employer engagement strategies, creating or expanding career pathways, reducing barriers to employment, and more effectively connecting students and graduates to jobs.  Helping people gain the skills they need to compete in the workforce is also a powerful approach to expanding access to opportunity and promoting economic mobility, because even as the economy improves, there are still vulnerable people at risk of being left behind.  Without the right skills and meaningful postsecondary credentials, these young people face entering the workforce without very bright prospects or, worse, unemployed and out of school.  We also need to create more opportunities for workers to obtain good-paying jobs that require more than a high school diploma but less than a college degree. This can help reduce unemployment by aligning education programs with the skills employers need.  As an example, JPMorgan Chase's New Skills for Youth initiative is helping expand high-quality education programs that begin in high school and end with postsecondary credentials and lead to long-term careers. Young people can gain the skills needed to enter high-paying occupations in growing fields, such as robotics, medical science, and coding, to build a promising future.  Failing to prepare young people with the right skills and education for these jobs is a missed opportunity for them personally, for our country, and our economy.  By working together on educational initiatives like New Skills for Youth, employers, nonprofits, and educational institutions can drive economic growth, promote greater mobility in communities throughout the country, and help more Americans achieve a lifetime of success.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgH4945-3.txt,1791,1230,2017.0,20.0,June

Right now I want to touch on an issue that has occupied a lot of people's concern and time this week over CBO scoring, rather important, but it should not be.  The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Commission do the scoring. Historically, the projections by CBO seem all too often to be far too out of line that any governmental entity would base important critical decisions over people's lives, their healthcare--it will certainly affect their lives--and base it on a group that, as they have explained: We set up models. And we feed the garbage--they don't use that term. But, as far as I am concerned, they feed garbage in and they get garbage out.  And projections: Oh, we have to wait and see what CBO says. People waiting with bated breath: Oh, is it going to be in line?  For heaven's sake, anybody that waits on a score for the JTC or the CBO in dealing with the tax reform that we should do doesn't have much sense. And there is nothing wrong with not having much sense. It just hurts the country when people without much sense are here in Washington making decisions about people's lives and encroaching on their liberty and freedom.  So we have people like Brian Mast, and we have those who have given all, the last measure of devotion, for our liberty. Then we turn around and have a Federal Government that passes laws about healthcare reform and decides that they have to have all of the medical records here in the Federal  And do you know what? We need to have a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau to protect people from unscrupulous bankers, so we are going to get everybody's banking records.  Well, as a former judge and as a former prosecutor, if you wanted somebody's banking records, you had to have sworn proof rising to the level of probable cause that a crime was committed and this person committed it, and then you got the records when a judge signed off on it. Not now. Not with the Consumer Financial Protection They just get everybody's records.  And then, without reining in ObamaCare and if we did not rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Washington continues to gather people's medical records through sweetheart deals with private entities, a hypothetical I raised many years ago as ObamaCare was being pushed through, came ever closer--really, is here--to the point that we could reach a day--it is not quite here. We have still got a chance to save America from the Orwellian nature of ObamaCare and the CFPB combined.  But years ago I said, you know, if we don't stop this craziness, we are going to reach a point where you could get a letter from the Federal Government, saying: Hey, we have got your medical records, but we notice that you made a purchase at the grocery store this last week and bought some bacon, a pound of bacon. We know, from having your medical records, that your cholesterol, weight is not at a very healthy point right now, so you are either going to have to quit eating bacon or we are going to be penalizing you substantially, since we are in charge of your healthcare, your health insurance. We are in charge of it.  That is where we have been heading. And it is something the Founders, who would not have seen the advent of the computers and the IT age, but what they did foresee, whatever developments in technology that came along, they foresaw this ongoing battle to keep government from controlling people's lives and eliminating their liberty. That is what they saw coming. They didn't have to see the technology. They knew what was coming if we didn't keep the Federal Government reined in.  I know there are groups out there that are gathering information that say: Well, this Member of Congress, this Senator, he doesn't get many bills passed. Well, if you look at most of the things we have passed, other than funding bills, so often they are creating more government agencies and more government power. Each time we do, no matter how noble the purpose is, we are taking just a little bit of freedom and a little bit of liberty away from individuals and giving more power to the government.  Why I think it is appropriate to bring this up as we approach Memorial Day is people have not fought throughout our history--going back to 1775, 1776, on to 1783 and the winning of the American Revolution, on through each of the wars that has been fought in the name of liberty--they didn't fight so that we could come to the floor and pass more and more bills and create more and more government. Even when we are told, ``Oh, but CBO says this will only cost $5 million this year, or only cost $5 million, so it is not that big a deal,'' it is still eroding people's liberty. It is still taking away freedom and giving more control to the government.  So, as we look briefly at some of the history on CBO scoring, this is an article by Paul Teller, Special Assistant to the President for Legislative He says:       A new report from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for      Planning and Evaluation calculated average monthly premiums      for health insurance in the 39 States that use      healthcare.gov. The research found that from 2013 to 2017 the      average ObamaCare premium increased by 105 percent across the      country. The report also looked at the cost spikes by       While we await further analysis of the CBO score for the      American Health Care Act as passed by the House, this      information is an important reminder about the negative      impact of       Besides just how unaffordable ObamaCare has been for      hardworking Americans, you might consider three key things      about today's CBO score in the context of this new report.       Number one, the original CBO estimate of ObamaCare      premiums, November 30, 2009, said that premiums for the      ``nongroup'' exchange markets would increase slightly and      ``would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016.''  CBO has the gall to act like they are so important and so accurate, but over and over, if you look at critical projections they have made and for people to have said, and CBO, in 2009, you know, by 2016, you might have a 10 to 13 percent increase in your premiums is, or would be, laughable except for the crying of Americans across the country who can't afford the premiums that have gone up 2, 3, 4, or 10 times.  One of our small-business employers said he paid, a couple of years ago, $53,000 for his employees' health insurance, and the following year it was $150,000 for his employees. That leaves him without personal income because he had such a dramatic increase in the premiums. But how could that be? CBO said maybe a 10 to 13 percent increase over that 7-year period.  It comes back to show, once again, as I told Bloomberg this morning, it appears those folks, figuratively speaking, couldn't find their rear end with both hands.       Number two, even if you assume CBO's AHCA estimate is      completely accurate, the first score, March 17, 2017, showed      that the bill would bring down nongroup premium costs over      the next 10 years. While CBO did say that premiums would rise      slightly over the transition period, attributed to the repeal      of the individual mandate, by 2020 the AHCA would change the      trajectory of premiums and ``By 2026, average premiums for      single policyholders in the nongroup market under the      legislation would be roughly 10 percent lower.''                              {time}  1300  So you hang around and wait for 10 years under the original AHCA and you might have a 10 percent decrease 10 years from now, which is absurd. They were so desperately wrong on their projections.  And I don't have it in front of me. It may be in one of these articles here, but I think originally their projection of cost of ObamaCare was about 1.1, $1.2 trillion over 10 years; and then, of course, the President got upset, because he had said: Oh no, it is going to be under $1 trillion for 10 years.  He calls the Director of CBO over to the Oval They have a conversation and, amazingly, the Director of CBO comes out and says: You know what? After meeting with the President, while I--things came clearer for[[Page H4599]]me, and turns out it probably will be $800 billion or so. It will be like the President said. I just needed to speak to the President to all of a sudden have a lot more clarity than I did before I went to the Oval But it is under $1 trillion, like the President said, now that I think about it with more clarity.  And then, of course, after ObamaCare passed, very quickly we started learning, no, it wasn't going to be under a trillion; it was going to be over a trillion; maybe 1.7, 1.9. And before long, we start seeing projections more like $2.6 trillion over 10 years. And even one that I had seen that said, you know, maybe 3.6, roughly $4 trillion over 10 years.  As I have said a number of times, you know, any scoring agency whose margin of error is plus or minus 400 percent really shouldn't be relied on by anyone trying to create meaningful law in That is why for a number of years I have been pushing for the elimination of CBO for a better system, where, as Americans, we believe in competition--or we used to.  Now, I know we have got some folks that can't compete. They need a safe space if somebody is going to compete with them. But what made America great was American competitiveness. We could compete with anybody and prevail.  So why wouldn't we have scorers compete so that we could score the scorers, so that every critically important bill to the American public didn't get sidetracked by some bogus models?  And I am not saying they do it intentionally. You don't have to do it intentionally to have a margin of error plus or minus 400 percent. You can be legitimately that bad at projecting what things will cost; and it has happened throughout the time that we have had projections.  So what I was proposing--and I got my friend, who was the chairman of the Budget Committee, to agree to sit down to dinner with a dear friend of his, Arthur Laffer, former economic adviser to Reagan, now an adviser to President Trump, and also a friend of both of ours, Steve Moore, who had been the senior editor with The Wall Street I asked if the Budget Committee chairman would sit down with me and Arthur Laffer and Steve Moore and talk about  This has been a number of years ago. We sat down at the Capitol Hill Club one evening and, of course, my friend, Tom Coburn, walks by and says: Is this one of those puzzles? Figure out which piece doesn't belong here? I get chairman of the Budget Committee, I get Wall Street Journal guy, Steve Moore, I get economic adviser Art Louie, what are you doing at this table?  But it was my idea. We needed to come up with a way to have competitive scoring by competitive scorers, and then get to where we can score the scorers, so that when we look at a score that is presented to us on a bill that is being proposed, you can look at the score of that scoring entity. And if they have a score, say, of 10 percent, being right within 5 percent, plus or minus margin of error, then we can probably take very seriously their scoring in the future.  My friend--at that time he was Chairman Ryan--was very open to discussing it, but really kind of felt like we needed to keep CBO and have an official government scorer.  But since then, Laffer called sometime later to let me know that he had received a private grant, and that he, his firm, and his son would be working on a model that could work for Congress, the House and Senate, to begin having competitive scoring and scoring the scorers so we could have something more reliable, so that we didn't have a bunch of bureaucratic melees from models created that kept us from doing what was good for  So, as I think has been pointed out before, whether you ask CBO, ``How much Federal revenue would we have come in if we had 100 percent income tax or 200 percent income tax,'' or if you said, ``Tell us how much Federal revenue comes in if we create a 200 percent income tax,'' since they are not allowed to consider reality and history, but only the models they create mechanically, it's probably a good chance that they would probably dutifully come in and say: You know what? If you set up a 200 percent income tax in the United States of America, then next year you will bring in twice as much money to the Federal Treasury as all Americans make in that year.  Because they are divorced from reality, it doesn't work into their models they create.  In talking to my friend, I hope he doesn't mind my sharing it. I hope he will invite me to have spaghetti with his family at his home in Nashville again sometime. I love visiting with him there, being with his great family.  But he was very encouraging. I was a little depressed. He said: You are a big-idea guy. Don't get discouraged when you propose big ideas like the CBO, getting rid of them, having competitive scoring, or having a--  See, we get beat up every time we say: You know what? Like Dan Webster had found, we have 82 Federal programs charged with getting people to and from appointments, and we don't need 82 Federal agencies. Most of them have white, 20-seat vans, carry three people when they ever carry anybody.  But if we try to eliminate one of the 82, well, you Republicans hate seniors or children or puppies or whatever it is. You are evil. So we keep 82 Federal programs to get people to and from agencies; whereas, if we could create--maybe it is a standing committee and we pull people from different committees--a public assistance committee where we have all 82 of those in every area of public assistance, we see all the duplication because it is all in the same committee, then we can start getting some kind of reasonable Federal Government back under control. Another idea that we just need to move on.  But I have been joined by my friend, and I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.Bacon).

The first overt act of the American Revolution in South Carolina occurred in McCormick County, at Fort Charlotte near Mount Carmel on July 12, 1775. McCormick continued to grow after the discovery of gold in 1850 and the expansion of the railroad. Today McCormick is known for its ``Natural Pace of Life,'' with ample outdoor recreation opportunities and hospitable citizens.  On behalf of South Carolina and all of us here in the Senate, I offer congratulations to the entire McCormick County community on reaching this milestone. Best wishes for continued success and prosperity.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-09-pt1-PgS2844-2.txt,2234,ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE FUNDING CUTS,2017.0,9.0,August
13371,topic-id,454,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization  I will make some short comments, and then I would like to defer to Senator Whitehouse, and then I would propound a unanimous consent request.  I think we will soon be able to pass the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization I reintroduced this measure this year with Senator  The bill before us is almost the same as the one the Judiciary Committee cleared by voice vote in the 114th Congress, and it is very similar to the one we hotlined last year. We hotlined it in April, and all the Members of this Chamber had several months to review it. We had one objection, and we cleared it earlier this week.[[Page S4650]]  The bill would extend a Federal law known as the Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act for 5 more years. The centerpiece of this 1974 legislation, which Congress last extended 15 years ago, in 2002, is its core protections for youth. These core protections call for juveniles to be kept out of adult facilities, except in very rare instances. They ensure that juveniles will be kept separated from adult inmates whenever they are housed in adult facilities. They call for reducing disproportionate minority contact in State juvenile justice systems.  States adhering to these requirements receive yearly formula grants to support their juvenile justice systems.  This bill would promote greater accountability in government spending. The Judiciary Committee, which I chair, heard from multiple whistleblowers that reforms are urgently needed to restore the integrity of the formula grant programs that are the centerpiece of our current juvenile justice law. The Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention administers this formula grant program. This program would be continued for 5 more years under the bill, but the Justice Department would have to do more oversight if this bill is enacted.  This bill also calls for evidence-based programs to be accorded priority in funding. The goal is to ensure that scarce Federal resources for juvenile justice will be devoted mostly to the programs that research shows have the greatest merit and will yield the best results for these young people.  Finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank our many cosponsors. This bill is truly a bipartisan effort, and many Senators contributed provisions to strengthen this bill since we introduced it last The bill reflects the latest scientific research on what works best with at-risk adolescents.  At this point, I would ask that the Presiding Officer turn the floor over to Senator I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for being so persistent in this effort, as well.

13198,topic-id,2678,"Mr.President, Congress and our country desperately need to have an honest, meaningful, transparent, and bipartisan conversation about improving our healthcare system. It shouldn't be a tall order, but around here things that seem common sense to the rest of the country are never simple. Instead, partisanship too often wins. We have seen that with the Senate Republican healthcare bill, as it was crafted behind closed doors without allowing any Democrats or the public to see it until it was a proposal.  It is good news that a vote on the bill was delayed, but we must continue to have this conversation as the debate continues. That bill was bad for North Only when we seek real bipartisan solutions do I believe we will be successful in improving our healthcare system.  We need to reform our healthcare system. I have been saying it for years. In fact, I have proposed a number of fixes over the past 3\1/2\ years, but none of those fixes are embodied in the Republican healthcare bill. It is just not the right direction.  Just yesterday, I joined many of my colleagues to bring up some commonsense bills we can and should take up right now to make sure American families aren't hurt in the near term. We called on Republicans to work with us, but, unfortunately, they objected. I want to work in a bipartisan way. I want real healthcare reform. But, unfortunately, I do not believe everyone in Congress feels that way.  First, we need to talk about the facts of the Senate Republican bill--facts that are from very reputable nonpartisan sources.  Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report reinforcing that the Senate Republican bill is just as terrible as the bill that came out of the House of Representatives a[[Page S3843]]few months ago. The Senate bill would rip away health insurance from 22 million Americans by 2026, including 31,000 North Dakotans who would lose private health coverage. You can't put a few bandaids on a bad bill and expect that North Dakota would not feel that pain.  Just as in the House bill, the biggest savings would come from severe cuts to Medicaid--a program that would see a 26-percent cut in 2026. The bill would slash a lifesaving program that 90,000 North Dakota children, individuals with disabilities, seniors, and low-income families rely on for affordable, quality care. That includes 36,000 children in my  The Senate Republican healthcare bill would get rid of the Medicaid expansion and cap the amount of Federal funding States can get to cover those traditional Medicaid patients. That would drastically reduce the amount of Medicaid funds going to the This would push those remaining costs onto States and counties that can't afford it. Importantly, it also would push the cost onto other patients. The American Hospital Association estimates that North Dakota Medicaid would lose $1.2 billion through 2026. At the same time, North Dakota forecasts a $46 million shortfall for 2015 through 2017--that is our biennial period--and another $103 million shortfall for 2017 through 2018. You tell me how our State would pick up these extra costs for our families and our children. Unfortunately, we just will not be able to do it. We would be forced to discontinue care. That is just wrong.  Those Medicaid cuts would also imperil rural hospitals, which have seen their amount of bad debt fall by 45 percent because of Medicaid expansion. Helping those rural hospitals keep their doors open and deliver care close to home for farmers, ranchers, and communities is absolutely vital to rural development and vital to those people who are still working in rural America to put food on our table.  Additionally, the North Dakota Hospital Association released a study showing that healthcare and social assistance accounts for one of every seven workers in this I am going to repeat that: Healthcare and social assistance accounts for one of every seven workers in our Spending reductions under this Senate bill would curtail those jobs, hurt economic development--especially in rural communities--and make delivery of healthcare even more expensive for our rural families.  The cuts to Medicaid would take away coverage from many North Dakotans who are also seeking treatment for opioid abuse and addiction, which has reached an epidemic level in our State, as well as across the In fact, I had one North Dakota healthcare provider who was looking at providing additional behavior and mental health services. In the traditional hospital setting, about 14 to 15 percent of the patients are on He believes that once this hospital opens, anywhere from 60 to 70 percent of the patients will be dependent on Medicaid funding for their healthcare. If that money is not there, if there is no reliability about that money, how do we build the treatment services we need to attack this epidemic?  I want to dispel a myth about Medicaid, and that is that these are just people who can go to work every day, that they are not even working, that they are just on the public dole, and that they are just getting this money. The truth is that in North Dakota 83 percent of adult Medicaid enrollees are in families with a worker. That is a statistic according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family  For North Dakotans who get coverage on the individual marketplace, this bill would raise premiums 76 percent higher than what would be required to be paid under the current law. That statistic, again, is according to Kaiser Family Seniors would be especially hard hit, with premiums more than doubling for those older than 55. The bill would disproportionately push the costs on to older Americans, who tend to live in rural communities, like all of those across North  Under the Senate bill, in 2026 a 64-year-old with an income of $56,800 would pay annually $20,500 for a silver-level healthcare insurance plan. That is more than one-third of his or her entire income, and that is more than eight times what the same person would pay under the current law, which is $6,800.  The bill would also enable insurance companies to impose lifetime maximums on coverage, once again, making it unaffordable for many people with life-threatening or long-term illnesses or disorders to get the treatment they need to live by.  This bill is a not so thinly veiled attempt to provide tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals at the expense of rural communities, like those across our Nearly 45 percent of the tax cuts in the Senate bill would go to the top 1 percent of incomes, those people making over $875,000 a year. I will say that again. Nearly 45 percent of the tax cuts in the Senate bill would go to the top 1 percent of incomes, those making over $875,000 a year, according to the Tax Policy  But what is more telling about these striking statistics is the stories. I have heard from so many North Dakotans about how scared they are that this bill could pass and how it would hurt them if it ever happened. I have heard from North Dakotans with preexisting conditions, like cancer or asthma, parents of children with disabilities on Medicaid, adults with elderly patients in nursing homes, farmers and those in rural communities who rely on rural hospitals, and those receiving treatment for opioid abuse.  The consequences of this bill for North Dakotans are real. I want to tell some of those very real stories across my State, because way too often we forget this is an issue that could not be more personal.  I want to introduce you to Allison and Jennifer This is her wonderful family. This is Allison here. Allison, from West Fargo, was almost 2 years old when she was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease. Allison's parents were told she would become severely mentally delayed by age 3, and she would likely pass away by the time she was 10 years old. I am so proud to tell you and so glad to tell you that this prediction did not come true.  Over the past several years, Allison has been able to get new, very expensive therapy that helps slow the progression of her disorder. Because there are currently no lifetime limits on coverage, Allison's family has been able to afford this treatment. Today, Allison is 16 years old. Allison needs physical therapy multiple times per week to truly make a difference in her life day to day and to help her live longer. Her private insurance covers just 12 physical therapy appointments per year. Allison is one of many children with disabilities or special needs on Medicaid, which covers the rest of her physical therapy.  For her and her family--you can see them here--who are so proud of the courage of Allison, it has been a lifeline, and it has been a lifegiver. But the Republican bill would enable insurance companies to impose lifetime maximums on coverage, which many North Dakotans, like Allison, would reach in no time. It would slash Medicaid--both expansion and traditional Medicaid--making it harder for families like Allison's to afford coverage and critical treatment for their children with special needs. The Restemayers should never ever have to worry.  I have spent a lot of time with Allison, and I think anyone who meets her knows that this world is a much better place with Allison healthy and alive. We are so proud to call her one of our friends. She has been an inspiration to me and my staff. She has participated in a lot of dialogues, and her advocacy has been absolutely instrumental in telling the story of families like hers in North  I want to talk about Emerie and Amy At just 2 months old, Emerie, from Bismarck, had her first set of seizures and was diagnosed with a rare neurological condition. Her parents, Amy and Johnny, have crisscrossed North Dakota and visited many hospitals out of State to get Emerie the care she needs and to control her life-threatening seizures.  Emerie is now almost 4 years old and has spent a total of 8 weeks in the hospital since she was born. She receives therapy multiple times per week and needs various medical equipment. Just 1 month of therapy out-of-pocket would cost her family--good, hard-working people--$3,000. Emerie is on[[Page S3844]]Medicaid, which has enabled her family to afford her hospital stays, her home healthcare, and her therapy. It has also enabled them to keep their daughter home with them in a loving family relationship, in a lovely family situation.  It is because of the access to Medicaid that this family has been able to stay in their home and keep their jobs, but the Senate Republican healthcare bill would rip Medicaid away from families like Emerie's. This family does not deserve that, and neither does any family who is working hard to take care of their children. These are all of our children, the children we see today who suffer from disabilities, who live and inspire us with their disabilities and their hope. This small help these families ask for from the Medicaid system should not be threatened, and these families should not be calling congressional offices begging us to please, please do everything we can.  Finally, I want to talk about Frances is one of the nicest people you are ever going to meet. For 25 years, she was a third grade teacher in When she was 21 years old, while she was teaching, she was diagnosed with a syndrome that affects the nerve endings in her body. She became paralyzed but taught herself to walk again. For the rest of her life, she will have to face the challenges that come with this disorder. Today, Fran can't walk anymore, and she has been in a wheelchair for the past 24 years.  For most of her life, Fran lived independently with her husband, who passed away in 2000. In the past few years, she has reached a point where she needs full-time care. She is now 84 years old. She lives in a nursing home in Harvey, and she has been there for 4 years. Fran had been in and out of nursing homes a few times beforehand, all which required private pay. Because of the extreme costs, Fran doesn't have any money or savings left. She spent it all on her healthcare.  Now she is one of many seniors on Medicaid, which enables her to afford the quality, long-term care she needs to live with dignity and support. At the nursing home, she gets extensive assistance with bathing, dressing, and doing any activities. Fran doesn't know what she would do without She doesn't have any children to help her. Her siblings are all older than she is, and they wouldn't be able to provide her with the level of care she needs. If it weren't for Medicaid, Fran would be out of options.  The Senate Republican bill threatens the coverage that Fran has and that so many others rely on. You know what, we cannot let that happen.  This issue has many faces. These are just three North Dakota faces I want to talk to you about. These families aren't interested in politics. They couldn't care less about politics. They want the ability to take care of themselves. There is no guilt to any of these conditions. There is no ``you did it to yourself'' to any of these conditions. This is the human condition.  We have to decide as a country, are we together in taking care of each other, or are we all on our own? That is the issue. How do we take care of the sickest among us? Are we together, or are we on our own? I believe we are stronger when we stand together to provide care to each other and to those who are not as fortunate.  I was talking to some of the families. It is hard when you are a mom, I think, to think about, well, what was your life with your child growing up? I had two children, born extraordinarily healthy. They barely missed a day of school, they were so healthy. They had an opportunity to engage in every level of activity, giving me and my husband the freedom to pursue other things in our lives. That is a gift. It is also a gift that we as a society can help those who don't have that level of good fortune but have children who need some special attention, children whose care you cannot afford on your own.  From the discussions I have had with so many of the families, very few of us could ever afford the medications and the therapies that guarantee quality of life not only for the child but for the family in terms of respite care.  Allison, Emerie, and Fran, we are going to keep talking about this, and we are going to keep evaluating all of the proposals that come our way. When they don't do right by you, Emerie, Allison, and Fran, when it is not the right solution for your family, it is not the right solution for North Dakota, and it is not the right solution for this country. We have work to do.  I know the Presiding Officer has been one of the leaders in analyzing and reviewing these bills. We have had a chance to have some discussions. I hope we will have further discussions about how we can continue to care for these wonderful North  The Presiding Officer knows story after story, having been a physician. Being a physician, my husband can tell you story after story about people who are challenged. In this system of healthcare, we all have to decide whether we stand alone or together. I believe America is stronger when we stand together and help each other.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

13161,topic-id,1412,"Madam President, today the Secretary of Homeland Security has the opportunity to prevent an injustice and keep a family together. At 9 a.m. Hawaii time, Andres Magana-Ortiz was scheduled to report to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Honolulu to be deported from his home of nearly 30 years.  Andres was brought to America when he was only 15 years old. In the years since, he has raised three children who are U.citizens, is married to a U.citizen, has built a business, and has distinguished himself as a hard worker and a pillar of the South Kona community in  Andres' immigrant story is one familiar to so many American families. After working for more than a decade as a laborer on coffee farms across the Big Island, Andres saved enough money to buy his own farm. In the years since, Andres has taken on management of 15 other area coffee farms.  Suzanne Shriner, president of the Kona Coffee Farmers Association, put it best in her letter of support for him when she said:       Mr.Ortiz is a true example of the American Rising      from a farm worker to a farm owner, he has created a      successful business through hard work.       He has sent his children to college. And he has given back      to his community, by working with other farms and farmers to      control an invasive pest. His story is why we need to find a      path to citizenship for these vital members of our farming      community.  Andres has three children. Victoria, age 20, is a junior at the University of Paola, age 14, and Hector, age 12, are still in middle school. Their lives will be shattered without their father.  Andres remains on very good terms with his first wife, Veronica Ledesma In a letter she wrote to me, Veronica shared how much Andres cares for his children and how devastated they would be if he is forced to leave. She said:       Andres is a wonderful father to our children. They depend      on him for so much and need him during these years that are      so important to their development as human beings and      citizens of the United Paola and Hector are children      with special education needs.       This has been very hard for us as parents, but together we      have worked to help her through school and life.       I am not able to support this family by myself.       Andres is an amazing role model to my children. He is a      patient, loving, and supportive father to them in whatever      they need. Victoria, Paola, and Hector love Andres very much      and would go through extreme emotional hardship if he is      deported.  She continues:       My oldest daughter will need to halt her college career to      help me support Paola and Hector, especially because this      deportation would bar him from returning to the [United      States] for 10 years.       My children deserve a father to care for them, they deserve      the educational opportunities he can offer them, and the love      he shares with them every day.  I couldn't agree more.  In September 2014, Andres received a stay of removal in order to pursue various paths to achieving legal status. In fact, he has a pending application to receive such legal status.  Last November, he applied for an additional stay. Without warning or explanation, the government changed its position in March 2017 and ordered that he be removed.  At that point, Andres filed for relief in Federal court. His case ultimately reached the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where his request for an emergency stay was denied. Although the Ninth Circuit found it could not stay his removal, the chief judge of that court, Judge Reinhardt, issued a powerful, concurring opinion that clarifies the injustice in this case and made a powerful moral argument against President Trump's immigration policy.  Judge Reinhardt wrote:       It was fully within the government's power to once more      grant his reasonable request. Instead, it has ordered him      deported immediately. In doing so, the government forces us      to participate in ripping apart a family. Three United States      citizen children will now have to choose between their father      and their country. If they leave their homeland with their      father, the children would be forced to move to a nation with      which they have no connection. All three children were born      in the United None has ever lived in Mexico or      learned Moving with their father would uproot their      lives, interrupt their education, and deprive them of the      opportunities afforded by growing up in this country. If they      remain in the United States, however, the children would not      only lose a parent, but might also be deprived of their home,      their opportunity for higher education, and their financial      support.       Subjecting vulnerable children to a choice between      expulsion to a foreign land or losing the care and support of      their father is not how this nation should treat its      citizens.       President Trump has claimed that his immigration policies      would target the ``bad hombres.'' The government's decision      to remove Magana Ortiz shows that even the good hombres are      not safe.  Mr.Ortiz is by all accounts a pillar of his community and a devoted father and husband.  The court went on to say:       It is difficult to see how the government's decision to      expel him is consistent with the President's promise of an      immigration system with ``a lot of heart.'' I find no such      compassion in the government's choice to deport Magana       We are unable to prevent Magana Ortiz's removal, yet it is      contrary to the values of this Nation and its legal system.      Indeed, the government's decision to remove Magana Ortiz      diminishes not only our country but our courts, which are      supposedly dedicated to the pursuit of justice.       Magana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only      victims. Among others are judges who, forced to participate      in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity      as well. I concur as a judge, but as a citizen I do not.  Judge Reinhardt made an important point, and I agree. The government has the power to prevent this family from being torn apart. Even now, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly can issue an administrative stay to let Andres stay in this country while the government processes his application to receive legal status.  Earlier this week, I spoke to Secretary Kelly on the phone to discuss Andres' case and to urge him to issue a stay that would allow him to stay in this country. Hawaii's congressional delegation has also written him a letter and provided a variety of other letters of support that Andres' friends, family, and neighbors have written on his behalf.  Secretary Kelly, I renew our call once more: Let Andres stay in our country. Let his children have a father present and active in their lives. It is not too late to keep this family together.  This entire ordeal speaks to the fear and anxiety spreading through immigrant communities across our country. Even the good hombres, as Judge Reinhardt called them, are at risk of being torn away from their families.  In an email, a spokesperson for ICE said: ``While criminal aliens and those who pose a threat to public safety will continue to be a focus, DHS will NOT''--and the word ``not'' is in all caps--``exempt classes of removable aliens from potential enforcement.'' This is chilling. It means that 11 million people in our country will live in fear that they could be deported at a moment's notice.  We must pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship and which prioritizes the unity of families. Andres' case is a tragedy, if not averted. There will be more cases like his in Hawaii and across the country. We must continue to fight on behalf of the good hombres and not stop until we succeed.  I would like to conclude by reading part of a letter I received from Gerald Personius, one of Andres' friends and a fellow coffee farmer from Captain He said:       Andres is a courageous, honest, caring, and dedicated      person. So I ask you as a citizen of our beloved country to      do the best you can to help this man continue to pursue his      citizenship. He will not let America down.  We cannot let Mr.Ortiz down.  I yield the floor.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.[[Page S3353]]  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

13143,topic-id,369,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.1644, the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions I thank the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from California (Mr.Royce); and the ranking member, the gentleman from New York (Mr.Engel), for their leadership in this important legislation.  This legislation furthers North Korea's severe financial isolation by further targeting banks and money lenders to gain cooperation throughout the region. This bipartisan bill builds on the pressure and sanctions imposed under both the Bush and Obama administrations to strengthen our response to North Korea's continued belligerence by, number one, expanding sanctions on North Korea's government transactions involving precious metals, minerals, jet fuel, and coal; providing restrictions on U.foreign assistance to any country that buys or sells military equipment from North Korea; and provides increasing scrutiny of North Korean shipping vessels to target against trafficking, counterfeiting, and aspects of North Korea's illicit economy, among other things, in order to tighten sanctions in accordance with the United Nations Security This vote comes at a critical juncture. Despite rounds of sanctions aimed at squeezing the faltering economy of North Korea, recent reports from the peninsula suggest that the country continues to gain sufficient traction to move forward.  North Korea poses a real and immediate threat to the stability in the region, to our allies, and to ourselves. By broadening eligibility activities to be sanctioned and extending the duration of sanctions to prevent arms trade, this bill will further leverage the North Korean economy to enhance our ability to reduce its nuclear threat. What is more, this bill will strengthen our ability to hinder trade between North Korea's strongest partners, including businesses and banks within Russia and China that are exposed to the international financial market. In the face of growing uncertainty and seeming lack of clarity surrounding the current administration's plan toward North Korea, this act demonstrates the strong, bipartisan, and resolute stance of this Congress in the face of increased provocative and aggressive actions by North  As an original sponsor of the unprecedented legislation signed into law last year that sanctioned North Korea for its egregious human rights violations, I am proud to now support this critical legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.

13158,topic-id,762,"Mr.President, last year the Nation was shocked by undercover videos produced by investigative journalists with the Center for Medical Progress exposing Planned Parenthood's sale of fetal body parts and the callousness with which Planned Parenthood officials described their grisly work.  As we know, as Planned Parenthood and its allies in the mainstream media hoped, outrage fades with time, and attention turns--but not for long, for the abortion industry and its profiteers are never really beset by scandal. They are a scandal.  Just last month we got another reminder about the reality behind the talking points. Once again, it was the undercover journalists of the Center for Medical Progress doing the investigative journalism the mainstream media refuses to do. Once again, the video has been ignored by the pro-abortion media elite, whose principal interest is the story of the prosecution of the journalists for daring to speak this truth to their power.  The American people and their representatives in the U.Senate deserve to know what the new video shows. It shows the founder of Planned Parenthood's Consortium of Abortion Providers on a conference panel. She recounts a harrowing experience while performing an abortion: ``An eyeball just fell down into my lap, and that is gross.'' Her remarks were greeted with laughter from the audience.  It shows another Planned Parenthood doctor stating: ``The fetus is a tough little object, so taking it apart in the womb is very difficult.''  This comment echoes a previous undercover video in which a Planned Parenthood doctor says that the bones of a 20-week old fetus were so strong that ``I have to hit the gym for this.''  The video shows the director of abortion services for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast saying that she sometimes uses forceps to ``pull off a leg or two'' to ensure an unborn child dies before being born--in other words, to avoid the moment when our Nation's laws might protect that child.  The video shows the medical director of Planned Parenthood in Michigan talking about surprising common ground between abortion doctors and pro-life activists.       We might actually both agree that there is violence in      here. Let's just give them all the violence, it's a person,      it's killing. Let's just give them all that.  That is not what they say in public. It certainly isn't what they tell their patients, the women who come into their clinics--just in private, at industry conferences, between networking opportunities and drinks at the open bar. Because they know--deep down, everyone knows the Center for Medical Progress videos shock, but they do not surprise. They don't teach us anything we don't already know. All they do is remind us of an inconvenient truth that demands our attention and our action.  It is certainly stirring the pro-abortion political machine into action. As expected, the Center for Medical Progress is once again the target of criminal and civil investigations designed to intimidate further questions about the abortion industry's methods and money. But the truth is out. It is there.  As we know, threats and intimidation are tactics of guilt and desperation of the losing side in every battle[[Page S3350]]that has ever been fought. If Planned Parenthood were what they have publicly declared themselves to be, they would welcome transparency. We all know why they hide because we know what they hide.  The question, as always, is not what they will do, but what we will do. And the answer is always ``as much as we can.'' We can start by enforcing existing abortion laws and by reforming others, for example, making the Mexico City policy permanent so taxpayer money is not used to promote abortions to disadvantaged people overseas or ending abortion after 20 weeks when unborn children begin to feel pain. We can confirm Federal judges who follow the Constitution rather than reverse engineer their preferred policy outcomes.  The truth about abortion is spreading because of advances in medical imaging, because of brave journalists, tireless activists, compassionate doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals.

13329,topic-id,319,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman McClintock for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1927. Nearly a decade ago, the National Park Service, with the help of the Organization of American Historians, completed a study to help identify significant sites related to the modern civil rights movement. Through this effort, the National Park Service found that many sites with a connection to the movement had not been formally recognized and that many were in severe disrepair and at risk of being permanently lost.  This legislation establishes a network of sites to include all National Park Service's units and programs, as well as other Federal, State, local, and privately owned properties for the National Register of Historic  A similar network was created previously by Congress to identify and commemorate the sites and stories related to the underground railroad. This bill would allow the National Park Service to build partnerships with other public and private entities to help preserve the remaining sites.  As part of my religious beliefs, I believe that knowing who you are, where you come from, is a foundation of knowing where you are and where you will be going.  History teaches us important lessons that we need to learn and grow from.

13303,topic-id,2762,"Mr.President, I appreciate the remarks from my colleague from Wisconsin, who came here to champion the citizens of her State and the citizens of all of As she spoke so passionately about the need to make sure we have affordable, quality healthcare, that is really the theme that we are talking about. That is the value we are talking about, that in this great big, beautiful, wonderful Nation, the United States of America, everyone should have access to affordable, quality healthcare.  There are some colleagues here who do not share that value. They consider healthcare to be a privilege for the wealthy--healthcare for the wealthy, healthcare for the healthy--but not healthcare for all They say: You can't afford healthcare? Too bad.  They have a plan of 13 Republicans meeting in secret--the secret 13--even meeting in a room to which the hallway is not accessible to press because they are afraid to have the cameras showing them as they go into the room and out of the room. If you are ashamed to see yourself going in and out of a room and for your constituents to see that, shouldn't you be ashamed of what you are concocting? Shouldn't you really wonder if you are doing the right thing in saying to your constituents: I am not going to show you the bill because I know you will not like it. I am going to keep it secret, and I am going to bring it out at the last minute. I am going to employ a tactic that does not belong in the  This is supposed to be a deliberative body--once called the world's greatest deliberative body--but under this leadership, it is now the body of zero deliberation, zero committee meetings, zero markups, zero chance for the public to weigh in, zero chance of hearing the experts and taking their insights into account. That has to change.  We need three of our colleagues who believe in this Nation, who believe in the Constitution, written with those beautiful three words ``We the People.'' They need to stop thinking about ``we the powerful'' and ``we the privileged.'' They have to stop thinking about how they help their friends in the gated communities of America or in the corporate suites of How do you help working Americans? How do you help struggling Americans?  Franklin Roosevelt said that the test of our progress should not be whether we do more--add to the abundance of those who have much--but whether we do enough for those who have little. Yet the philosophy of this bill that the secret 13 is cooking up is about giving more to the abundance of those who have much and taking away from those who have little. It is the opposite. It is government by and for the wealthy and government by and for the powerful and government by and for the privileged.  Have they forgotten the first three words of our Constitution? Have they forgotten that the philosophy, as Jefferson put it, was that we would have outcomes that would reflect the will of the people? If you are afraid to share the bill with the people of America, you are certainly not pursuing the will of the people of the United States of  What is really in this bill?  On the one hand, we understand that it is going to take healthcare away from millions of They are saying that it might do it a little more slowly than did the TrumpCare bill.  As for the TrumpCare bill, the President himself said it was ``mean,'' and he used a derogative slogan, which I will not repeat on this floor, to say how terrible it was. Why did the President call it ``mean''? Was it that it was taking away healthcare from an estimated 23 million people? My colleagues, we understand, are going to do it more slowly, inflict that damage over a number of extra years. Does that make it right to hurt people? Does that make it right? In the meantime, they are going to hand out an insurance bag of goodies to the health insurers of $127 billion. Strip healthcare over here. Give goodies to the insurance companies over here.  What happens to those who are in long-term care and nursing homes? More than 6 out of 10 Americans who are in long-term care are there because they are paid through They have to pay down all of their income and their wealth before they can use This is the last resort. It is the last thing they have. Medicaid comes to the rescue.  I visited a couple of nursing homes over the weekend, one in an urban area and one in a rural area. I encourage my colleagues to go visit a nursing home and talk to the men and women who are there. They are so thankful that they have that care.  One woman said to me: ``Medicaid is how I am paid for.''  Her name is  Deborah said: ``Medicaid is how I can afford to be here. If you take it away, I am out on the street. Being on the street is a problem because my legs do not work.''  Picture that individual being thrown into the street. She is in her wheelchair because her legs do not work. Where is she going to sleep? How is she going to feed herself? Where is she going to bathe?  Then I went to a nursing home in rural Oregon, which was down in the south, Klamath At that nursing home, they told me that almost 100 percent of their long-term care patients are paid for by Medicaid--almost one 100 percent. Imagine that entire hallway of individuals swept out, tossed out.  And why? What else do we have in this bill? Give tax deductions and gifts to the health insurance executives. First we have gifts to the health insurers and then another $18 billion to the health insurance executives.  Then my colleagues say: Let's make insurance cheaper by getting rid of the essential benefits. That way, people can have an insurance policy for less.  But unfortunately it is not worth the paper it is written on. We have been there. We have seen that. There is a reason you set a floor as to what the benefits are. It is so that when you actually get sick and need to go to the emergency room, you can actually go. When you actually get sick and need an operation, you can actually get it. When you break a leg, you can actually get it set. When you need treatment for a disease, you can actually get the treatment. When you are having a child, you can actually get maternity care. These are the fundamentals. They are not the fancy end of healthcare. It is not the fancy end that you might find with some executive healthcare packages. These are the basics, the essential basics. My colleagues want to strip that away.  On the other hand, they say: Hey, we have so much money that we can give tax giveaways to the prescription drugmakers--$29 billion to the prescription drugmakers.  Then they want to destroy the rural healthcare clinics and hospitals. I was in four of my rural counties this weekend. I was in Klamath and Lake, and I was in Grant and I held townhalls. People came out and spoke to me.  These folks said: Do you know that our rural clinics are the heart of our[[Page S3610]]communities, and they are what allow people to live here with the confidence that they can get the healthcare they need instead of having to go to some city that is hundreds of miles away or maybe not even be able to get care at all on a timely basis?  They love their hospitals that provide care in the bit larger communities in rural  Yet, as for the heads of these hospitals and the heads of these clinics, what do they say? They say that without the Affordable Care Act and the vast decrease in uncompensated coverage, they would have to fire a whole lot of employees and provide a whole lot less healthcare.  One doctor from a clinic in the northeast corner of the State came to me and said: We doubled--roughly doubled--the amount of healthcare we are able to provide, and we are so remote, and it is so important to be able to have that nearby.  So why do my colleagues really dislike healthcare in rural America? Why do they want to undermine it? Well, they can give away more money to medical device makers--$20 billion to medical device makers--and all of this is before we look at the fact that they are giving more than $200 billion away to the richest So over here, let's strip the essential benefits. Let's destroy the health clinics. Let's undermine the rural hospitals. Let's make it challenging for those with preexisting conditions. Let's take those in nursing homes and make sure they are not able to be in nursing homes and, magically, maybe they will get cared for some other way so we can give tax giveaways to the health insurers, tax gifts to the insurance executives, tax goodies to the prescription drug makers, and special tax provisions to the medical device makers, and then give $200 billion to the richest Isn't that the opposite of the test of our progress? Here, in the United States of America, under a system of government that is supposed to be of the people, by the people, for the people--this bill is by the privileged and powerful, for the privileged and powerful. And not just that, but let's really hurt ordinary working people and struggling Americans in the process right where it really gets them--right here--at the fundamental heart of the peace of mind they get from knowing that currently they have access to healthcare.  I don't know that anything is quite so disturbing as worrying about the fact that if your loved one gets sick, will he or she be able to get the care he or she needs? If your loved one gets sick, will he or she go broke? And what about your neighbor, and what about your extended family? This Republican bill is all about creating stress and anxiety and bad outcomes for ordinary working Americans, ordinary middle-class Americans, ordinary struggling  They didn't send us here to the Senate to do this. That is why the secret 13 are meeting in secret. That is why they don't want to meet in a room that has a hallway where the reporters can be. That is why they don't want to answer the questions in the hallway about whether they will vote to proceed to a bill without letting the people of America weigh in on it.  Shouldn't everyone here be willing to answer that question: Are you willing to vote to move to a bill that has had no public process? Aren't you working for the people of America? Or, as this bill says, are you just working for the companies and the rich? That is it, and too bad for everyone else.  Aaron in Portland wrote to me. Because she has been diagnosed with diabetes, she is terrified that if TrumpCare goes through, her condition will be considered a preexisting condition, and she won't be able to afford the coverage she needs. She says: ``Although through committed lifestyle changes and family support, I have done well managing this condition, I will be marked as high risk along with my age.''  Ellen from Medford, the southern part of our State, tells me that she has the challenge that her baby daughter was in a catastrophic accident just days before her second birthday. Her husband had just switched jobs and didn't have health insurance yet. But, fortunately, Medicaid--that would be the Oregon Health Plan--was there for them, and her daughter got the lifesaving care she needed. That is anxiety for an ordinary person. Do you have health coverage when you are switching jobs? Is there one health insurance you can afford?  My colleagues want to strip healthcare from Ellen in Medford so they can cut $800 billion in Medicaid overall, so they can give tax giveaways to powerful corporations and the richest It is just wrong, morally wrong, and wrong in every possible way.  Marilyn from Ontario says that she is living with two autoimmune diseases--difficult to pronounce, so I won't. She was diagnosed before the ACA became law, but rather than be denied coverage outright by her insurance company, she was told she could be covered if she paid a monthly premium of about $1,000 with a $20,000 deductible--$20,000 deductible. Needless to say, that wasn't helpful to her. Marilyn went 5 years without insurance, and she ended up being very sick. She had to borrow against her home, leverage her home. She had to deplete her retirement savings. And she had to make payments on $64,000 worth of credit card debt, run up in order to cover her healthcare.  Then the ACA came along, and Marilyn was able to afford insurance, and she got community pricing. In other words, despite these preexisting conditions, you pay the same price as everyone else. That is so important to peace of mind about healthcare. Just saying that you will have ``access to healthcare''--a favorite phrase some of my colleagues use--if you can pay extraordinarily high prices that I know you will not be able to pay, that is not access. That is teasing people. That is cruelty to say: Oh, yes, we are going to make sure you have access; as long as you are a millionaire and you can pay a ton every month, you have access. We have taken care of you. You have access. No, that is not access. Affordability is critical to having a functioning healthcare system, and Marilyn will probably be priced out of the market again with the Republican strategy.  How about Lisa in Corvallis, a single parent of three children, two with serious medical conditions that have placed them on permanent disability. Lisa faces some hard times, and I will let her words speak for themselves. She says:       Our family was very fortunate and eternally grateful that      the ACA passed while I held that job, because in 2015, my      middle child was hospitalized for the first of four times in      the last two years. And, in March of 2016, I developed a      serious heart condition which my doctor attributes in part to      stress.  She goes on to say:       In June of 2016, my employer declined to renew my contract,      and if it weren't for the ACA, I would have been out of a job      and completely without medical coverage, this time with a      serious and expensive preexisting condition.  The stories are coming in through emails. They are coming in through my townhalls. They are coming in over the phones. They are letting us all know--and not just in States represented by folks on this side of the aisle, but every Senator here is getting these letters.  So I say to my fellow Senators: Read these letters from your constituents because I know that your constituents are in the same position my constituents are in. Be a champion for them. Be a champion for struggling families, for working families, for middle-class families. Honor the role and responsibility of representing all of the people of your State, not simply powerful companies and your richest constituents but all of your citizens. That was the vision on which our country was founded, and that is the spirit in which Franklin Roosevelt said: This test of our progress is not whether we give more of the abundance to those who have the most, but enough to those who have little.  Enough means affordable, accessible healthcare for every single person in Tearing that down is wrong morally and wrong to do it secretly and wrong in terms of the enormous damage that it will cause.  I am pleased to see my colleague from Pennsylvania, who has been a champion for working Americans every day he serves in this He particularly makes sure that all of us are thinking about the impact on children, and there is so much of this secret Republican plan that is going to hurt the children of I appreciate the insights that he shares with all of us as[[Page S3611]]he urges us to ponder and do better every time we consider legislation.

13160,topic-id,2697,"Madam President, over the Memorial Day weekend, Alaska lost two really great men. These men were doers and they were builders in every sense of the word--both literally and figuratively. They were family people, and they were the best of friends to one another and to so many of us.  Today I wish to pay tribute to Sam Brice and Howard Otis--although, nobody called him We all knew him as ``Buzz'' I wish to take just a few moments this afternoon and tell Members of the Senate a little bit about these two very wonderful and great men.  You really couldn't find two more genuine Alaskans than Sam or Yet neither was born in the They came to  Sam grew up in He was educated at Columbia University in New York So he was a long way from New York City when he came to Fairbanks, He served in the Marine Corps, and then he moved to Alaska to help his parents, Luther and helenka, establish a family construction business there in the  The story is pretty legendary about his mother helenka. His mother spelled her name always with a lower case ``h''. She didn't want the capital, and always made sure that you put the emphasis on the ``len'' in helenka. She was really the epitome of an independent, self-reliant, really strong Alaskan woman, and she wouldn't let anyone forget that. She was very outgoing, vivacious, and had a heart of gold. I think it all wore off on her children. We certainly saw that in  It was said that Sam Brice never met a stranger. He was known for remembering every good deed that others did for him--no matter how many years in the past it may have been, decades after the event. He always generously returned the favor and always remembered to just say: ``Thank you for that''--``thank you for that.''  Sam was one who just did good. He did good throughout the Those in rural Alaska have fond memories and affection for a man who helped build their communities and who was a leader. He was a leader of the Associated General Contractors, and in his later years was well known for roasting his fellow contractors at the AGC dinners. He had a great sense of humor, and that humor was really contagious.  The lines from Sam's obituary really say everything one needs to know about the man. They are:       In lieu of flowers, the family would wish all to remember      Sam who lived by example, whether a handshake, a smile, or a      contribution; he was always willing to lend a helping hand.      Please remember all the different ways Sam has touched      people's lives and consciously think how you can make the      world a better place, as Sam demonstrated throughout his      life. We ask you honor Sam's memory by emulating his      compassion to others and be a friend to man.  Sam's memorial services were this past I was unable to attend. I know the church was packed to overflowing. But as I was in another part of the State that day, I couldn't help but think of those words from the obituary about how we can individually and collectively think about how we can make the world a better place by being compassionate to others, being a friend to others, and living that in our daily lives, as Sam did--truly, truly a great man.  His friend Buzz Otis was also a transplant to He grew up in He was educated at Michigan State and came to Alaska in 1975, thinking he was just going to explore the State for a few months, like so many who come to our They think they are just going to come, take a peek, and then leave, but as with many Alaskans, that didn't happen with In 1976, he founded a landscaping business in Fairbanks called Great Northwest, and this was really his ticket to business success and to a lifetime commitment to  I have so many good friends throughout the State who are givers and doers. I just think we Alaskans have a tendency to want to give back to our communities. We help our neighbors. Buzz Otis did that in spades. He was involved in a lot of different levels politically. He was a strong supporter of mine and other members of the Alaska delegation. He served on the Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly and was elected as its presiding officer. He chaired the Fairbanks Economic Development Corporation and managed the North Pole Economic Development  He was just involved in so many different aspects of his community. He was an outdoorsman and loved sports. He was a rugby player and had a rugby pitch. He loved the sport of dog mushing and encouraged young people to take it up. He was just always doing, always engaged.  He was blessed in life to have a great family and a wonderful, beautiful wife, That family standing together was a beautiful thing to watch in terms of the support they all gave one another, and it was truly so for Buzz, as a father and as a family man. I just can't think of anything better. Family really does come first.  That is ultimately what claimed the lives of these two wonderful men who had so much life left in them. Buzz's son was out on the river, and Sam and Buzz went out to check on him in Sam's plane. It wasn't out of the ordinary to do this. It was good weather, good visibility, and a pretty fair day for the It turns out that Buzz's son was OK, but the flight ended in tragedy. Sam's plane went down near the Salcha River on the morning of Saturday, May 27.  If only this story had a happy ending. Instead, it had somewhat of an Alaskan ending. Sam and Buzz gave their lives doing what so many Alaskans do; that is, looking out for one another, looking out for their families.  But we know we don't remember people for how they lost their lives. We remember people for how they lived their lives. Sam and Buzz were truly ``salt of the earth'' They were honest, hardworking, caring, and adventurous. They hired local people, they treated them well, and they were always welcomed back by the communities they served so faithfully. They really dedicated their lives to the betterment of the last frontier, and they never forgot family. Family was always first.  Everyone says that you can't say enough about these people, and it is true. So I will conclude my remarks and just simply express the Senate's condolences to the Brice and Otis families: to Joan Brice, to Renee Otis, to their children, and to their families--great families--destined to carry on the legacies of Sam Brice and Buzz               75th Anniversary of the Aleutian Campaign  We just recognized Memorial Day last week in our respective I[[Page S3351]]was pleased to be with many Alaskans as we observed Memorial We clearly revere those who serve in our military. In Alaska, we are home to more veterans per capita than any other State in the  This year, I was privileged to host a most distinguished veteran at Alaska's official State veterans' memorial. This is located in a place called Byers Lake, which is midway on the Parks Highway between Fairbanks and It is extraordinarily picturesque. It is very tranquil. It is almost a spiritual place in many, many ways, as we look out to Denali in the background, being surrounded by the memorials for honoring those veterans who have served us.  But I was able to bring to that gathering a very distinguished veteran, our Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, a former Navy  This following week, just on Sunday, I was able to do yet another Memorial Our focus was not on those who gave their lives on foreign soil but in a battle for American soil. Our focus this past Sunday was on what is known as the ``forgotten battle'' of World War It was the bombing and subsequent occupation of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska by It was a yearlong campaign, and for those of us in Alaska, it is a campaign that we often speak about and we share the stories. There are veterans of that campaign who are still around today, sharing stories with us. They are living legends, if you will.  I recognize that for many, if you were to ask them whether the United States has ever been occupied--occupied in World War II--they wouldn't know. I think, unfortunately, the name the ``forgotten battle'' may be just exactly that. Most Americans don't recognize that the Aleutians were occupied by the Japanese, that Americans were killed in defending our homeland, and that some of the indigenous people were either transported to Japan as prisoners of war or evacuated to the southeastern coast of our State, a thousand miles away.  Making sure this ``forgotten war'' is not forgotten is a mission for me. It is an important part of our Nation's history. Again, that Aleutian Campaign was a yearlong campaign--fighting weather and terrain with equipment that was clearly not up to the challenge--to reclaim U.territory from a determined Japanese force.  A little bit of the history: On June 3, 1942, Japanese forces bombed Dutch Harbor and, over the succeeding days, occupied the islands of Attu and These islands were occupied by Native people who had been there over a thousand years.  It was not until May of 1943 that Attu was retaken, and 549 U.and Allied troops were killed in combat. But there is evidence that the U.and Allied losses in the Battle of Attu were much higher as a result of exposure, disease, Japanese booby-traps, friendly fire, and frostbite. Let me just tell you, the elements out there in the Aleutians are particularly harsh. When you don't have the equipment, it makes it even more so.  The war in the Aleutians came at a great price for our Native people who had lived on those lands for thousands of years before the war. The homes were burned, churches were burned, and 881 of the Aleut residents of 9 separate villages were relocated to abandoned mining and fishing camps in Southeastern Alaska, where they were forced to live under some pretty tough conditions.  At the remembrance event that I attended in Alaska on Sunday, some of the evacuees were at the ceremony. They were there. They shared their stories about what it meant to literally be ripped from their village--without having any idea what was really going on--and then sent to an area that may have been a foreign country to them. On the Aleutian Islands, the environment is entirely different from that of a cannery in in Southeast But what was extraordinary about these evacuees was, despite the very harsh, difficult, and, in many cases, horrible conditions, they never gave up. They didn't give up hope, and they certainly didn't give up their patriotism. Twenty-five men from the evacuated villages chose to join the fight. Three men joined the retake of All were awarded the Bronze Star for their valor.  I think it is important to remember that the many lessons to be learned from the Aleutian America once perceived itself as a nation oceans away from foreign threats. Today, I think it is unthinkable for us to think that any of our territory could be occupied by a foreign power. But we must never forget that during World War II, a portion of the United States was occupied, and it was occupied in those days, as today, because Alaska is a strategic location. These lessons cannot and should not be lost to history.  We all know the saying that those who forget history are condemned to repeat it. The Japanese incursion occurred less than a decade after GEN Billy Mitchell testified that Alaska is indeed the most strategic place in the world. The incursion taught our Nation a vital lesson--that the defense of America begins in Fortunately, the lessons of the Aleutian Campaign and Alaska's strategic location are not lost on today's military planners.  Let me walk you through what we see in the State of Alaska right now, recognizing the proximity of Alaska to some of the hot spots around the world, whether it is North Korea, Russia, or Alaska is seeing a renaissance when it comes to our military presence. We see it at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, where Air Force F-22s and AWACS launch to acknowledge their Russian counterparts that are flying in the Air Defense Identification We see it at Eielson Air Force Base, which is preparing to receive two squadrons of F-35s beginning in 2020. We see it in the soldiers of the 4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team in Anchorage, who are now waiting deployment to We see it in the soldiers of the 1st Stryker Brigade, who will soon begin their rotation of pre-deployment training at the National Training We see it in the crews who are staffing ballistic missile radars in the State, looking very carefully at North We also see it in the patriotic construction workers who will begin building the new long-range missile discrimination radar at Clear Air Force Station this summer and on the missile fields of Fort Greely, ready to intercept an ICBM aimed at the North American continent from wherever. We see it in the Navy SEALs who train in Kodiak and in the coastguardsmen who protect our coastline from Metlakatla in the south, all the way north to the  I think it is very clear that never again will the United States leave Alaska undefended, which brings me back to the characterization of the Aleutian Campaign as the forgotten battle. Seventy-five years ago, U.and Allied troops were called upon to repel an invader who occupied U.soil. We in Alaska, particularly, will never forget that fact, but neither should  Ignoring the fact that war has been, in fact, waged on U.soil in this last century is a dangerous and a tragic thing. Let's resolve on this 75th anniversary of the start of the Aleutian Campaign that the forgotten battle is be forgotten no longer.  As I prepare to leave the floor, I would be remiss if I didn't add that at the remembrance event in Unalaska this weekend, it was not only an opportunity for many of the remaining evacuees to come together in Alaska--for some it was their former community; others were from the Pribilof, Kiska, and It was a coming together. It was a homecoming for some, but there was also an effort to bring together many of our veterans who had served in the Aleutian Campaign and whose only exposure to the Aleutians was when they came in to defend that territory. To have the exchange between those who had been forced from their homeland and those Americans, those veterans who had come to help--to have them united in a conversation for the first time ever was an exceptional American story.  Over the course of 3 days, the sharing of stories was a remarkable opportunity for us. I had a chance to speak with one of our World War II veterans who said: I always knew what our part of the fight was about, but I had no idea how what we were doing from the war effort had impacted these displaced people--the original people of the Aleutian To have that sharing, again, was a remarkable part of the story.[[Page S3352]]  Then, to complete that picture, there were several individuals who were part of a Japanese film production company and were there to do the filming of this 75th remembrance because, as they said: This is an exceptional part of our history coming together too.  Recognizing, sharing that, and allowing the stories, again, to ensure that this is not forgotten was a very significant and, I think, healing opportunity for so many.  Madam President, I thank you for the opportunity to share this important part of our history, ensuring that the forgotten battle is not forgotten.  With that, I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to support H.2847, the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act, which would help to ensure that all the congressional resources that would be provided for foster youth will indeed be utilized and make sure they are used to help them in the furtherance of their education and becoming independent.

All of these bills passed the House last year as part of the Family First Prevention Services Act, which also provided significant new investment in substance abuse, mental health, and parenting skills services to help kids and families avoid foster care when possible.  We continue to work on a bipartisan basis with our leadership and our colleagues in the Senate to find a way to move forward on broader foster care improvements, but today's action provides a good opportunity to once again highlight the sharp rise of children in foster care in the United States and, indeed, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, fueled in part by the opiate crisis.  In Massachusetts, between 2011 and 2015, the number of petitions to remove children from their homes grew 38 percent. Today, Massachusetts is home to nearly 10,000 kids in foster care. Over 1,000 of them are considered at risk of reaching adulthood without being adopted or safely reunified with their birth families. That is why it is so important that we do everything we can to help them finish their education and develop mentoring relationships with supportive adults.  While I am pleased that our committee and the full House are working together to help these young people, we can't ignore the bigger picture, which is the President's attempt to overturn the Affordable Care Act, because it will have real and measurable negative effects on these kids.  Republican Medicaid cuts jeopardize health coverage for older foster youth, the same youth we are trying to help with this bill. By cutting the essential health benefits and Medicaid, there will be a consequence. In turn, this endangers access to substance abuse treatment and, by extension, many of the treatment centers themselves.  Republican proposals to end the Social Services Block Grant would reduce States' abilities to provide substance abuse, mental healthcare, and supportive services to foster parents.  While these larger issues are deeply troubling, today's five children welfare bills, including the one before us now, represent an improvement over the status quo, and it is refreshing to note the bipartisan collaboration that is involved.  In addition to Congresswoman Bass' leadership on this bill to help foster youth, let me also recognize my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee who are providing great leadership on these very issues--Mr.Davis, ",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgH4951.txt,854,KOREAN INTERDICTION AND MODERNIZATION OF SANCTIONS ACT,2017.0,20.0,June

Mr.Speaker, H.1913 establishes the Clear Creek National Recreation Area and the Joaquin Rocks Wilderness Area on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the central coast region of From hiking and hunting to off-highway vehicle use, those designations will improve and enhance access for a variety of recreational activities, while ensuring that ecologically sensitive and unique areas are managed in a way that supports their lasting and permanent protection.  In addition to the many ecological benefits they provide, including clean air and clean water, wilderness areas throughout the country play a large role in supporting the approximately $646 billion per year outdoor recreation economy, so I am pleased that we are advancing this bill to add 21,000 acres of the National Wilderness Preservation  This bill has strong local support from San Benito County government officials and a number of off-highway vehicle and wilderness groups. These advocates understand that Clear Creek is important to the economy, and they have fond memories of the recreational opportunities when they were younger.  I have received numerous support comments from my constituents, the off-highway vehicle community, and other California residents about the importance of Clear Creek to their family and how the closure has impacted them. It is time to honor the desire of my constituents in California's 20th Congressional District and pass this bill once again.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of the bill.                                            San Benito County,                                      Hollister, CA, June 1, 2017.     Re Letter in Support of H.1913.     Jimmy Panetta,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Panetta: I would like to express my      support of proposed legislation H.1913. On at least three      previous occasions, the San Benito County Board of      Supervisors has formally expressed their support of this      proposed measure in the form of H.1776 as submitted by      then-Congressman Sam       As background, the Serpentine Area of Critical      Environmental Concern (ACEC) of the Clear Creek Management      Area (CCMA) was closed in 2008 based on a study by the EPA      which concluded that naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) posed      a public health risk. However, in 2010, the Off Highway Motor      Vehicle Recreation (OHMVR) Division of the State of      California Department of Parks and Recreation Commissioned an      independent OHV-specific risk assessment of NOA exposure      within the Serpentine ACEC of the       This report, completed by the International Environmental      Research Foundation (IERF), concluded that management and      operation strategies could be employed to allow for off-     highway vehicle (OHV) recreation in the CCMA without exposing      the public to higher than acceptable levels of NOA and      without presenting a serious risk to human health.      Specifically, the risk of OHV usage five days per year, for      eight hours on each of those days, was equated to being      similar to the lifetime risk of smoking less than one      cigarette one the same one year period, and the report noted      that other recreational activities, such as swimming, hiking      and snow skiing, are over 100 times more dangerous.       In light of this report which directly contradicts the      conclusions of the EPA study and undermines the necessity of      BLM actions taken since 2008 in reliance of that study, it      would appear that closure of the ACEC is not scientifically      warranted, and especially not during winter months when dust      from OHV activity is greatly reduced.       Therefore, the County supports opening the area to OHV      users once again and allowing the public access to this      natural area which is easily accessible to the urban      residents in the San Jose/San Francisco metropolitan areas.      H.1913, which would establish the Clear Creek National      Recreation Area in San Benito and Fresno Counties, is      essential to enhancing public access to natural and scenic      areas within our       The lack of evidence of a serious health risk is reinforced      by the fact that there is[[Page H5411]]     the lack of any documented case of any person, whether      recreational, visitor or governmental employee, injured by      NOA within the ACEC despite the use of the area for decades.      Therefore, the activities taken to close the area are      especially troubling considering the effect of the closure on      the public generally, as well as the local economy.       Access to recreational areas within San Benito County,      including the CCMA, provides a necessary and substantial      component to the local economy which has been drastically      affected by the recent economic climate. The BLM's past      decision to close the Clear Creek area has already seriously      affected San Benito County's economic vitality. The County      could understand such action if there was truly a serious      health risk presented by use of the CCMA, but there is no      generally accepted scientific evidence, especially during      wetter winter months.       The Clear Creek Management Area was among the five most      popular areas cited by California off-highway-vehicle (OHV)      users in a 1990 study conducted by the California Department      of Parks and Many of these users were residents      of the San Jose and San Francisco In 2003 and 2004,      there were an estimated 50,000 visitors to the CCMA, largely      attributable to allowed OHV usage.       In conclusion, the Board of Supervisors supports the      proposed legislation, as well as designation of the Clear      Creek Management Area as a National Recreation Area,      designation of OHV recreation as a ``prescribed use'' within      the National Recreation Area, and providing that the      management plan of the Clear Creek National Recreation Area,      including OHV routes, open areas, number of permitted OHV      events and other recreational activities should be as set      forth in the 2005 Clear Creek Travel Management       Thank you for your consideration of this letter.           Respectfully,                                                Jerry Muenzer,                                            Supervisor District 4,     Board of                                  ____                                California Wilderness Project,                                   Cottonwood, CA, April 20, 2017.     Jimmy Panetta,     Washington,       Dear Mr.Panetta: We greatly appreciate your sponsorship of      H.1913, the Clear Creek National Recreation Area and      Conservation The legislation will permanently protect      21,000 acres of BLM land in Fresno and San Benito counties by      its inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation       The proposed Joaquin Rocks Wilderness follows the steep      northern slope of Joaquin Ridge which climbs high above the      floor of the western San Joaquin       Rising up over 4,000 feet from the valley floor, the      striking Joaquin Rocks are the centerpiece of this remote      area. These three scenic 250' tall monoliths are the eroded      remnants of an ancient vaqueros sandstone formation.       The Joaquin Rocks are named for the legendary Joaquin      Murieta, believed by some to be a heroic figure early      California and an outlaw by others. The Joaquin Rocks are      said to have provided a secluded hiding place for him and his      band place during the 1850s. The area also shows      archeological evidence of past Native American occupation.       The rugged area features deep canyons where oak woodlands      cloak the numerous spur ridges that descend to the valley.      Vegetation in the area includes, blue oak, California      juniper, grey pine, chaparral, and native grasslands. Due to      the cooler climate provided by its elevation, the area      provides outstanding displays of native wildflowers well into      summer.       The steep cliffs of the Joaquin Rocks--and the numerous      other towering sandstone formations found throughout the      area--are host to numerous falcons, hawks and owls. They      could also provide potential nesting habitat for the      California condor which has been reintroduced into the nearby      Gavilan One of the peaks of the Joaquin Rocks--La      Centinela--hosts a vernal pool that supports fairy and      tadpole shrimp.       The Joaquin Rocks proposed wilderness represents a unique      opportunity to preserve one of central California's most      outstanding natural landscapes and we sincerely appreciate      Mr.Panetta's efforts to protect it for future generations.           Best Regards,                                                   Gordon Johnson,                                      ____                                                   April 10, 2017.     Jimmy Panetta,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Panetta: As representatives of national      motorized recreation organizations we write in support of the      ``Clear Creek National Recreation Area and Conservation Act''      (H.1913). This legislation would designate 75,000 acres of      Federal land in San Benito and Fresno Counties in California      as the Clear Creek National Recreation Area (NRA) and would      ensure access for the responsible use of off-highway vehicles      (OHVs) in the area into the future.       Clear Creek was closed in 2008 based on a questionable      safety rationale related to exposure to asbestos.      Subsequently the California Off-Highway Motor Vehicle      Recreation Commission commissioned an independent risk      assessment study which concluded that management and      operational strategies could be effectively employed in the      area to allow OHV use without exposing the public to      unacceptable risks. H.1913 would guarantee that moving      forward, the area will be managed in such a way as to provide      for all sorts of legitimate and responsible recreation, while      also providing for the safety of all of the area's visitors.       Our support for H.1913 is possible because of the      endorsement of the bill from a broad array of local OHV      organizations, businesses and enthusiasts. This local support      is warranted not only because the legislation would reopen      the popular OHV area, but because a diverse group of      constituencies worked together on the bill.       We thank you for your statement upon introduction which      makes it clear that you recognize the importance of multiple      uses on public lands--``This bipartisan bill not only      bolsters our area's conservation efforts, it also promotes      recreation and tourism in our region. When this bill passes,      locals and visitors will no longer be restricted from      enjoying all that Clear Creek Management Area has to offer.''      We applaud this approach and hope that other Members of      Congress will look to H.1913 as a model for how to garner      support for land use legislation.       Thank you for introducing this important bill. We look      forward to working with you as it moves through the      legislative process.

Madam Speaker, many in this country believe Congress continues to have trouble accomplishing the basic requirements of its job. Up until a few weeks ago, we were still scrambling yet again to complete spending legislation to prevent a government shutdown.  If the only measure of national security success during the President's first 100 days were avoiding catastrophe, okay, President Trump has succeeded: no attacks on the U.S., no new wars, no nuclear  These are good things, and in the moment we can breathe a sigh of relief. However, these outcomes, arguably, owe more to the national security machine built by the President's predecessors than any decision of the 45th  President Trump's first major budget proposal will be released tomorrow. It is reported to include massive cuts to Medicaid and will call for drastically and unprecedented changes to antipoverty programs.  As for Medicaid, the State Federal programs that provide healthcare to low-income Americans, Trump's draconian budget plan would follow through on a bill passed by House Republicans to cut more than $800 billion over 10 years.  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this would cut off Medicaid benefits for 10 million people over the next decade. That is unacceptable.  The dysfunctional relationship between Congress and the Trump administration has helped to bog down and complicate the fiscal 2017 budget process and has stymied the work of this Congress when it comes to passing legislation that will help our constituents.  A recent survey found that 48 percent of Americans now prefer increased government spending in areas like healthcare, veterans care, education, and infrastructure--things that the people of my district, the Virgin Islands, desperately need, with a 15 percent unemployment rate and 33 percent of our children living in poverty.                              {time}  1930  It is time for Congress to get back to work for the people that have put us here.  I want to highlight three pieces of legislation that I have introduced that will help my constituents in the Virgin Islands in various ways.  With a special counsel now having been appointed to look into the distractions the White House has created, it is time that Congress focus on our job and proceed to hold hearings on these bills followed by a vote on the House floor, and, hopefully, these commonsense bills will be signed into law by the  Healthcare: President Trump and the Republican Congress are planning to cut more than $800 billion out of Medicaid funding over 10 years while converting the program to a cap block grant to the States and territories and eliminating ACA's Medicaid expansion. These provisions are in the American Health Care Act, the House GOP's ObamaCare repeal bill.  As a Member representing the Virgin Islands, I believe we need to get back to doing the work of the people, and that is working to pass laws that better the lives of our constituents.  I introduced improving the treatment of the U.territories under the Federal healthcare program, which would eliminate existing inequities the territories face under Medicaid and There are numerous bills that my other colleagues have introduced to assist their constituents and all Americans in areas of healthcare. We need to bring those bills to the floor and vote them up or vote them down.  Veterans: There are few places in the United States with higher per capita rates of military service than the United States Virgin As a Member, I am committed to ensuring Virgin Islands veterans have full and equal access to health, housing, education, and employment benefits they have rightfully earned. Our constituents have deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq more than 30,000 times since September 11, and about 120,000 military veterans live in the territories, yet none are allowed to cast a ballot to choose their Commander in  We need to remember that nearly 4 million Americans call Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa home, a combined population greater than 22 We represent those Americans in the U.House who cannot vote for their interests on the House floor. Our constituents are denied representation in the U.Senate and are barred from the general election for President and Vice When the Presidential vote was tabulated in 2016, it was as if 4 million Americans we represent do not exist. There is a time, however, when our people are counted--when the country goes to war.  I have introduced 91, which proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United States regarding Presidential elections, voting rights for residents of all United States territories and commonwealths.  Education: We have to fix the education system. We have to give our young people better choices. We need to allow our children to be able to be educated in a place that is hospitable to learning. That does not occur right now in many places in the United The President's budget cut would remove support to schools for infrastructure, for afterschool programs, and for summer reading programs.  We cannot continue with this if we want to have national security. National security is the security of our young people to be educated and to grow safely. That is not happening in the Virgin Islands or anyplace in the United States at this time.  I recently introduced the United States Virgin Islands College Access Act of 2017, which will allow college students who are residents of the Virgin Islands to receive more reasonable tuition rates at participating 4-year institutions of higher education.  It is time for Congress to stop doing business as usual. With budget decisions impacting everything from national security to infrastructure investment, Congress needs to focus on doing its job and doing it with more than the next few months or current fiscal year in mind. Moving forward, we as Members of Congress need to make sure that we deal with our legislative and budgetary responsibilities with more thoughtfulness and foresight.

13259,topic-id,2098,"Madam Speaker, I thank the Congressman so much for his comments.  I think it was very interesting that the gentleman was saying that the American people and people that he spoke with over the weekend want the truth. I think that is what we all here in Congress want. We want the facts. We want to hear specifically what has happened so that the people of the United States can make a decision about what happens next.  I am not here to ask for impeachment or ask for any rash decision, but I am asking that the American people be able to see a transparent Congress and a transparent process that allows them to then speak to us as Members of Congress as to what they would like.  Several months ago, almost 2 months now, several colleagues of mine and I wrote a letter to the Department of Justice, to the Acting Attorney General, requesting that he institute a special counsel, a special prosecutor, in this matter. We are grateful that that has happened. But a special counsel cannot replace an independent, outside commission and vigorous congressional investigation.  The appointment of a special counsel speaks to the urgency of investigating the Trump connection to Russia's interference in our election and the gravity of the President's abuse of power in trying to shut down the FBI Director; but the American people need to understand that, while a special counsel could bring charges against those individuals who were, in fact, if the facts prove to be so, in collusion with the Russians, it cannot do anything to the President except bring a report to this Congress for this Congress to act on.  This Congress needs to remember that we are a separate branch of government than the White This Congress seems to be acting as if it is part of the White House, an extension of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, when, in fact, this Congress stands alone.  We have a separate set of rules, a separate power, and a separate responsibility than the President of the United As such, Madam Speaker, it is important that we demonstrate to the American people that we are acting that way. A special counsel within the Trump-controlled Justice Department cannot replace a truly independent, outside commission, because it is the commission which would then be able to make a decision about our  I say it is our President because we all respect the Office of the President, and we want the world to know that we respect and hold in reverence the individual who holds that and hold him accountable for that position that he holds. An independent, outside commission, as special counsel, Director Muller's actions will still be subject to review and approval by the President Trump-appointed leadership of the Justice  Congress must act to create an independent, outside commission that is completely free of the Trump administration's meddling. A special counsel cannot be used as a pretext for Republicans to shut down investigations by Congress or hide the facts of the President's wrongdoing from the American people.  Now, I have heard the Justice Department and others talk about this being a criminal investigation, that the special counsel is using it as a special criminal investigation. As a lawyer, as someone who has been a prosecutor, I understand that the burden of proof for criminal charges are much different than this Congress would hold for a President if it were to ask for impeachment.  So this Congress must not abdicate its responsibility because the work needs to be done. Jobs need to be created and infrastructure needs to be put in place so that commerce can be done in this country. Healthcare needs to be put in place for We cannot lose more Americans' healthcare. We need to gain more Americans having healthcare. We need to settle the issues of immigration.  Madam Speaker, never mind criminal justice reform. It seems that this Congress has completely forgotten that, in the last Congress, we agreed, both Republicans and Democrats, to reform criminal justice. We are seeing our young people die not from the Justice Department and not just from what is happening on the streets, and never mind what is happening in our criminal[[Page H4420]]justice system. I understand that a bill is going to be coming on the floor asking for minimum mandatory sentencing for a slew of charges which will again increase the school-to-prison, cradle-to-death pipeline of prisons in this country.  So these are the things that we as Congress need to be concerned with. The national security issues that our President has are things that we need to continue to look at.  There is an old Washington cliche: personnel is policy. The same reflects the wisdom that any President's agenda depends on his political appointees to refine and implement that vision. Trump's White House has failed first and most spectacularly in this requirement. That failure may not even be the President's failure at this time but the people he has put in place by both building a dysfunctional White House and National Security Council and by failing to staff his national security agencies with the appointees necessary to oversee and direct foreign policy.  For now, the failures of Trump's political favorites with his new establishment professionals likely mean incoherence on the national security front for some time, with the White House lurching from one crisis to the next, its actions and words disconnected from any broader doctrine.  Bad personnel decisions have also dogged the Trump administration during its first 100 days. Michael Flynn and K.McFarland hardly did well in leading the NSC during their brief sojourns there. Low-level hires have also continued poor performance.                              {time}  1945  The most obvious foreign policy failures are that there is no policy, no doctrine, no strategy that knits together Trump's desired ends with the government's ways and means. That should be of concern to my Republican colleagues who want this Republican President to succeed. If you want him to succeed, you need to help him. The help needs to come in terms of the personnel that he has put in place, in terms of the transparency, and as they said, cleaning the swamp, getting rid of the swamp, so that there can be those professionals and those above reproach in the White House carrying out the mission of this  At the agency level, the Trump's White House political appointments machine has been incredibly dysfunctional, reportedly because of fights between the White House factions over personnel picks.  This has starved the Pentagon, State Department, Justice Department, and other agencies of under secretaries, assistant secretaries, deputy assistant secretaries, special assistants who actually are carrying out the President's agenda.  In the absence of an entire team, the uniformed military leadership and career civil servants of these agencies have carried on, but with significant friction given the personal disdain for these people during the campaign and afterwards.  The personnel failures have worsened the second category of the failures, those of process. If there was personnel, we also have process failures going on right now.  The NSC was codified in 1947, along with the modern Defense Department, CIA, and Joint Chiefs of Staff to correct perceived process failures during World War The big idea behind the National Security Act was to create a process that could withstand poor personnel by ensuring the institution of the presidency was well served by its national security agencies and could, therefore, make better informed decisions.  Despite its aspirations to run the White House like a fine-tuned machine, the administration has uniformly failed to implement processes to serve its agenda. Indeed, at times--an example being the 63-hour rush to strike Syria with cruise missiles or its announcement of a tax plan before the details were ironed out--the White House seems at war with the very idea of process, as if budgets, planning, and coordination were toxic features of the Washington swamp, to be rejected at all costs.  The biggest process failures have been those that affected the entire government. Trump's failure to develop detailed budgets, let alone to agree with Congress on the funding levels and priorities, nearly led the country to the brink of a government shutdown. All indications point to the impasse being settled, but the outcome will likely be a continuing resolution once again that punts all the major budget decisions and keeps agencies in limbo on major programs, including, if we are talking about national security, major weapons systems, acquisitions, spending on important training and exercises, and outlays for servicemembers and military families. This is something that is going to cause all Americans to suffer, spectacularly in some cases.  One of the President's biggest campaign promises, the pledge to build a wall on America's border with Mexico, has stalled for lack of funding, and proposals will likely remain stuck in the government contracts process for months, if not years.  His immigration orders have been held unconstitutional because of errors that his Justice Department or Department of Homeland Security lawyers would have caught and corrected had they been there or had a chance.  In some cases, the process failures have had deadlier consequences. President Trump ordered a risky special operations raid on Yemen over a dinner meeting with his senior staff with scant process or coordination. The raid went badly, as military operations sometimes do. Instead of taking responsibility, the White House blamed the military, both for the substantive failure on the ground and the faulty decision process that put the SEALS there. Disconnects between the White House, Department of Defense, and the U.Pacific Command resulted in a confusing saga regarding the movements of a U.aircraft carrier, resulting in the dilution of any deterrent value that President Trump's words might hold in Moscow or  The personnel and process failures contribute to policy failures across the national security chessboard. The most obvious Trump foreign policy failure is that there is no policy, no doctrine at this time. We deserve better in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, in China, in North Korea, but most importantly, here on the home front. We as Americans deserve a coherent, comprehensive process oriented as well as personnel driven with career intelligence individuals at the helm and within the ranks of each one of these agencies because we have a lot to lose.  We have our young people to lose if we go into wars that have not been thought out and have not been process driven. Our young people deserve better. Our world deserves better because the world is looking to America to still be the ones--although we seem to be abdicating our responsibility, whether it be in war or in the other forms of diplomacy that we engage in--to keep this a safe place. Famines that are going on in Sudan, in Yemen, and in other places, it is the American might, the might of our aid and our support to them, that keeps democracy alive, not just on the ground and in fact, but in the hearts and minds of those who yearn for it in other places.  That is the national security that this America needs to be engaged in, and it is that kind of national security that this Congress needs to be concerned with. We need to get back. We have a week of bills that are dysfunctional in themselves that do not serve the best interests of the American people. This Congress needs to stop scuttling legislation, scuttling bills that their colleagues are trying to put forward. Vote them up or vote them down. Let the American people know where you stand on every issue. We need to stop the voice votes that are going on in committees that allow Members to hide behind what their positions are with their constituents. I know it is not easy, but that is why we are all adults here. We want to put on our big girl pants and be the kind of people who can stand for what we believe.  So let's bring those bills forward. Let's support the infrastructure jobs activity, as well as national security and support for the world abroad. That is what we have to lose if we do not hold this President, this White House, and all of his agencies and his Cabinet accountable for the work that they are doing.

13283,topic-id,670,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill, H.1039, but first and foremost, I want to make sure that we recognize and honor the work and sacrifice that our police and first responders do each and every day.  This week is National Police Week and, frankly, it is an opportunity to honor every week, but in particular this week, those who run toward the gunfire, those who run toward the building on fire every day.  In my own district in Colorado, I hear so many countless stories of heroic acts and going above and beyond the call of duty by those on the front lines of keeping us safe. In one example in Colorado, Officer Ross Maynard responded to a domestic violence situation. The victim's former boyfriend had broken a living room window in the middle of January, leaving the victim and her young daughter exposed to our record cold temperatures. Maynard went above and beyond his duty and covered the window to keep out the elements. He vacuumed the shattered glass from the floor when he found out the victim didn't have a vacuum so that the child didn't receive cuts from the glass.  In example of heroism, dispatcher Sara Demgen calmly helped a man deliver his son when his wife went into labor and they realized they wouldn't be able to make it to the hospital.  It is individuals like these who we should celebrate and support through our work here in Unfortunately, the legislation we are considering today doesn't make anyone safer, and if we passed it, it would bring about a constitutionally dubious process that could interfere with the important work of law enforcement professionals.  Part of the reason this is problematic legislation is because the process this legislation followed--like a lot of stuff that we have to vote on--was not transparent and was not regular order. There was no hearing on this bill. Even if we look back at last year's version of the bill, there was no hearing on that one, either.  Then we look at the rule that we are debating now. Mr.Speaker, a rule means what is the process for amending this bill. What we have here is a shutting down of that process, where they didn't provide an open rule. They allowed only one amendment as part of this bill that had been offered. There was no opportunity on the floor, through what is called an open rule, for Democrats or Republicans to offer good ideas to improve this legislation.  Of the six amendments that were submitted that the Committee on Rules considered yesterday, five of them were killed by the Committee on Rules and not even allowed to be voted on or debated by the House of Now, the number of times I have had to come to this floor and argue against a closed rule or a structured rule is exhausting, and it is contrary to Speaker Ryan's promise that he made for the world to hear that he would bring us back to regular order and give everybody input on legislation that we consider in what is supposed to be the people's  This rule, yet again, is not open. It rules five of the six amendments out of order. The confidence and the trust in the House of Representatives, it is hard to imagine how it could even sink much lower, but it is restrictive processes and rules like this where neither Republicans or Democrats are allowed to even offer amendments or debate amendments to improve the legislation[[Page H4327]]that have led to the record level of distrust in this body.  In a moment, I will look forward to discussing the bill itself, but I just wanted to take this occasion in particular to celebrate our law enforcement professionals on National Police Week and every week.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgH4325-2.txt,1910,1245,2017.0,18.0,May
13284,topic-id,306,"Mr.Speaker, it seems that with each passing day, we learn more about the tangled web of conflicts of interest and secret meetings with Russians in and around the Trump campaign and Trump administration. Last week, President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey while he was overseeing the FBI's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian Government, after reportedly asking Director Comey personally to drop the investigation into former National Security Advisor Flynn's ties to This week, we also learned that President Trump revealed highly classified information provided by an ally to Russian officials.  Without President Trump's tax returns, we have no way of knowing if he himself has financial ties or is financially beholden to Russia or Russian interests, as news reports have suggested. The American people deserve to know whether or not President Trump has conflicts of interest, financial interests, or business dealings with Russia or other foreign governments. It is imperative that we, as the people's representatives, hold the executive branch fully accountable.  Mr.Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, H.305, which would require Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to release their tax returns.  If the President truly has nothing to hide, including business dealings or being economically beholden to Russia, he should freely release his tax returns to reassure the American people that they can have confidence that he is not acting out of conflict of interest but, rather, in our interest as a nation.

13292,topic-id,291,"Mr.Speaker, as they state, in part, in the letter: ``We are deeply troubled by recent legislative and executive actions that support this divisive `law and order' rhetoric and that chip away at our hard-fought efforts to sustain long-term trust between our communities and law enforcement agencies.''  This letter is signed by many current and former police chiefs, sheriffs, and other law enforcement officials.  In the letter that I included in the Record, which will now appear for the world to see, law enforcement professionals say that instead of pushing forward with this bill that we are being asked to consider under a closed and restrictive rule, we should focus on mental health and trauma services for officers to support them, programs and policies for de-escalation and crises intervention training, better staffing for our police agencies and probation officers, programs and policies that incorporate implicit bias training into police training and probation office training, and community-oriented policing. These are the types of policies that Democrats, and myself, would love to put forward during National Police Week to support our law enforcement professionals and to keep our communities safe.  Why aren't we focusing on those kinds of ideas, rather than a solution in search of a problem?  It is National Police Week, and we should be supporting legislation that protects and supports our police, not create a greater schism between our community and police through an unconstitutional bill that puts the lives of our probation officers at risk, and will likely increase recidivism among those on probation.                              {time}  1300  We can do better.

13163,topic-id,807,"Madam President, I would like to address the hearings that concluded just a few hours ago.  After hearing Mr.Comey's testimony today, America is stunned. The cloud hanging over this administration has just gotten a whole lot darker.  I commend both the chairman, Senator Burr, and the vice chairman, Senator Warner, for the way they ran this hearing. The Senate and the American people are better informed as a result of their work. Few committee hearings in the history of the Senate have produced the kind of eye-opening testimony we heard today. In its wake, I would like to make a few points.  First, for weeks, media reports indicated that the President had directly and indirectly pressured the FBI Director to end the FBI's investigation into General Innuendos and intimations swirled around. But we now know much more of the truth. There is now no doubt that Mr.Comey understood the President's request that he let go of the investigation into General Flynn--in a meeting during which it was discussed whether Mr.Comey would keep his job as FBI Director--as a direct effort to prevent that investigation from going further that looks a lot like a quid pro quo.  During questioning from a Republican Senator, Mr.Risch, Mr.Comey told us that he took the President's conversation with him about the FBI investigation into General Flynn as a directive to scuttle that investigation.  It is clear that President Trump's legal defense is to refute Mr.Comey's account. Well, the President threatened Mr.Comey with the release of tapes of their conversations. Presumably that includes the conversation in which President Trump asked Director Comey to ``let go'' of the Flynn investigation. It is awfully curious that no one from the President's team will either confirm or deny the existence of the tapes when the tapes are the only way to prove that Mr.Comey's testimony, which came under oath, is false or misleading. If President Trump disagrees with anything the Director has said today, he should play the tapes for all of America to hear or admit that there were no tapes.  Second, Director Comey's contrasting view of the Clinton email case and the Russia case is telling. Mr.Comey did not wish to see a special counsel in the Clinton case because he looked at the facts and determined there wasn't a case for one. With respect to the Russia probe, the Director examined the facts and felt there was enough potential evidence that a special counsel was warranted. Again, the contrast is telling.  Democrats and Republicans alike and the American people as well should be pleased that the investigation is in the hands of former Director  Third, the hearing raised serious questions about Attorney General Sessions that he and the Justice Department must answer immediately. Senators Wyden and Harris repeatedly asked Director Comey about Attorney General Sessions' involvement in the investigation before he recused himself. Director Comey didn't have direct knowledge of his involvement but made clear that he suspected that the Attorney General needed to recuse himself weeks before he actually did so and that he could not share the reasons for that in an unclassified briefing.  So we need to know the answers to a number of questions regarding the Attorney The Senate Intelligence Committee investigation and Special Counsel Mueller ought to get to the bottom of this matter.  In conclusion, Mr.Comey's testimony has been very enlightening, but there is much work ahead for investigators in Congress and those under the direction of Mr. Thank you.  I yield the floor.

It is a clear example of the way bipartisanship should be here in the House of  North Korea continues to act as a state sponsor of terrorism, test ballistic missiles, conduct cyber warfare, build nuclear weapons, and threaten the United States and our allies.  We need a strategy to confront North An essential part of that strategy is to confront North Korea with economic and political pressure. A key to that would be to get China fully on board and to be willing to threaten China with tariffs if China continued to serve as the lifeline for the North Korean criminal regime. In addition to working with China, we need to start modernizing our own sanctions regime to impose a greater cost on Kim Jong-un.  This bill expands the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act passed by this Congress in 2016 to provide expanded and mandatory and discretionary sanctions on the North Korean Government, particularly involving gold and other precious minerals, jet fuel, coal, iron ore, and textiles.  The bill requires U.financial institutions to ensure that no correspondent accounts are being used by foreign financial institutions to provide financial services to North It does a host of other necessary things, including requiring the State Department to submit to Congress a report detailing their decision on whether to put North Korea back on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, and that we get that report within 90 days.  It seems clear to me that North Korea should be listed as a state sponsor of terror. We took them off the list not because they stopped engaging in international terror, but as a quid pro quo for suspending their own nuclear program, which they didn't suspend.  So why are they still off the list?  There is no doubt that North Korea has engaged in multiple acts of international terrorism, including the murder of the half brother of Kim Jong-un; the cyber attack against Sony Pictures; and although the initial action was taken decades ago, they seized Japanese civilians in order to learn Japanese manners in order to instruct their spies. They continue to hold those Japanese civilians today in a continuing act of terrorism.  Finally, the bill, requires a report from the President of cooperation between North Korea and We would suspect that North Korea, after it builds a certain cache of nuclear weapons, would be willing to sell to Iran not for millions but for billions of dollars fully assembled nuclear weapons or the fissile material to create those.

13176,topic-id,174,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Avon Grove Red Devils men's lacrosse team on their State championship victory.  The Red Devils finished the season with a 23-2 record, beating Philadelphia area powerhouse Conestoga in the PIAA Class 3A title game with a thrilling 5-4 victory.  Sophomore Zach Augustine was one of the heroes, scoring the game-winning goal in double overtime, a moment that he described as ``unbelievable.''  This redeeming victory for them comes 3 years after a heartbreaking loss for the Red Devils in the 2014 State title game. Senior midfielder Doug Jones, a freshman on that 2014 team, said: ``I remember as a freshman saying to myself that I wanted to get back here. We knew we had one goal: to win this. It means the absolute world to us.''  I applaud the commitment displayed by these young men, both to each other and to their community. Congratulations to the Avon Grove Red Devils team, the coaches, their families, and the faculty, staff, and students that made this championship so special.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgH4901-2.txt,99999999999999,LEGISLATIVE SESSION,2017.0,13.0,May

13165,topic-id,912,"Madam President, every week for some months now, I have been coming to the Senate floor and I have been using the opportunity to talk about someone in my State, the great State of Alaska, who has made a difference. We call that person the Alaskan of the These are individuals who are unsung in many ways and who are doing something for their community, for their State, and in many ways are inspiring everybody.  I am a little biased, but I believe I live in the most beautiful State in the country, probably the most beautiful place in the world, full of wonderful people and beautiful landscapes, and we certainly encourage everybody here in the Senate or those who are watching on TV to come to Alaska and experience it themselves, and they will have the trip of a lifetime, guaranteed. We are also blessed to live in a land that provides so much for our physical and spiritual needs. It is a very spiritual place.  Alaskans are hardy people; however, like anyplace in the country, people have tough times. Some people are more fortunate than others. But thankfully we have people all across our State--like we have people all across America--who give of themselves so that those in difficult situations can receive the care they need.  Today I want to take you to Kotzebue, AK, or what we often just refer to as Kotz is about 550 miles northwest of Anchorage, 26 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska's Northwest Arctic About 3,000 people live in It is one of our bigger villages, and it is a hub for dozens of smaller villages that dot this enormous, beautiful region. Like most of Alaska, it is cold in the winter, and it is beautiful now under a never-setting The midnight Sun in Kotz is high in the sky. There are wonderful people there.  Like most places in Alaska, particularly in smaller villages in rural Alaska, community is everything. People take care of each other. People band together to help each other overcome challenges that can exist in the extreme environments we have in  Let me tell my colleagues today about Marty Shoryer, who is one of the very generous residents of Kotzebue and who is our Alaskan of the Born in Kotzebue, Marty is the general manager of Kotzebue Electric Association, where he has worked for more than 24 years. He has been married to his wife Lucy since 1977. They have six children and seven grandchildren. In his free time, he fishes--very common--plays hoops, and loves to cook for his family. He is also involved in[[Page S3354]]the Boys and Girls Club and his Tribal government.  But here is why I want to talk about Marty and why he has been such an inspiration not only in Kotzebue but throughout the On Thanksgiving 2015, Marty got sick, and over the next several weeks, he had to go to the hospital repeatedly. While he was there, he noticed a group of people who would gather around the free coffee that was served at the hospital. He approached one of them, a woman named Jo-Ann, and asked a very simple question: ``Why do you guys hang around here? What are you doing?''  She told him: ``Well, we don't really have another place to go right now.''  This disturbed Marty greatly. At that time of year in Kotzebue, it can get down to 20 and 30 below zero--a difficult place.  ``You guys must be hungry,'' he said to Jo-Ann, and she said that they were. So the next day and the day after that--5 days a week--Marty and Lucy together used their own money and their own lunch hour during the workweek to make sandwiches--a simple act--30 to 40 sandwiches for that group at the hospital. Every day, every person who needs one gets a sandwich, sometimes turkey and cheese, sometimes caribou or sheefish spread. Marty is anxious for the salmon season to start so he can make salmon spread sandwiches. They also get a juice box and dessert. Simple but generous.  Recently, another generous Kotzebue resident, Sophie Foster, began making sandwiches as well, and before you know it, we have a whole community that is doing this, taking this simple example and getting involved. So now some people drop off cinnamon roles or fruit. Others bring back bulk items when they travel to Dozens of people in Kotzebue, AK, are now helping in this effort because of Marty's simple act.  People like Marty and his wife Lucy make my State truly unique and a wonderful place. His generosity--doing something seemingly so simple: making a sandwich for someone who is hungry--has now had a big impact not only in Kotzebue but in Marty didn't know the impact he would have when he began making sandwiches. ``I was just trying to help a few people that day, make them happier.''  Marty's actions have initiated a growing conversation in Kotzebue about how best to take care of people who need help. It has drawn attention to homelessness and hunger--very important issues not only in Alaska but throughout the country. Marty spurred this important conversation in Kotzebue and in our State through his simple actions, and that has inspired all of us.  Congratulations, Marty, for what you are doing, for your simple acts of inspiration, and for being our Alaskan of the  Madam President, I yield the floor.

13272,topic-id,379,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy of a brave Montanan and American, Harold  Harold's story begins in Glendive, MT, where he was born in 1928 to Peter and Alma Harold and his family were well known in the community for their compassionate hearts and unrelenting work ethic. Harold took these Montana values to the U.Army in 1949, where he quickly became a highly decorated soldier, receiving a number of medals and citations.  In late November 1950, Harold joined the Company D, 15th antiaircraft Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry  Two thousand five hundred U.and 700 South Korean soldiers were deployed east of the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea when they were engaged by an overwhelming number of Chinese forces. By early December, the U.Army evacuated approximately 1,500 wounded servicemembers; the remaining soldiers had been either captured or killed in enemy territory.  Because Harold could not be accounted for by his unit at the end of the battle, he was reported missing in action as of December 2, 1950. Harold's name did not appear on any prisoner of war lists, and no returning soldiers reported him as a prisoner of war. The U.Army declared him deceased as of December 31, 1953.  In 1954, a number of remains were recovered from north of the Korean Demilitarized However, Harold's remains were not included and he was declared nonrecoverable. After his death, Harold was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism and leadership.  During a joint recovery operation in 2004, Harold's remains were found in a mass grave on the eastern bank of the Chosin Reservoir in North Thanks to recent technological advancements in forensic science, the U.Department of Defense positively identified one of the individuals as Harold After nearly 66 years, an American hero has been brought home to Montana for a full and proper military burial.  Harold represents the very best that this Nation has to offer with his profound bravery and dedication to service. Like many before him and after him, Harold paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect the freedoms that make the United States the greatest Nation in the world.  To Harold and his family, on behalf of myself, Montana, and a grateful nation, I extend our deepest thanks for Harold's service, sacrifice, and valor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgS3645-2.txt,1829,1230,2017.0,20.0,June

13354,topic-id,335,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise to support the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care  In fiscal year 2015, almost 21,000 youth aged out of foster care, meaning they left foster care without a permanent family connection. Many of them are often poorly prepared for adulthood and lack some of the basic skills they need to be successful adults.  Last year, the House passed the Family First Prevention Services Act, a bill that would improve the lives of children and families by making sure more children can stay safely at home and not enter foster care in the first place, helping to make sure fewer children age out of care. The bill also updated the John Chafee Foster Care Independence Program to allow States to assist older former foster youth up to the age of 23, including providing education and training vouchers, to help those young people who do age out to have a better future. Unfortunately, it did not pass the Senate, so it never became law.  I am glad my good friend, Mr.Faso, introduced the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act to highlight the needs of these older youth, and I know many will benefit from the changes made by his bill.  Specifically, this bill would support older youth leaving foster care by allowing existing funds used for financial housing, counseling, and employment support to support older youth leaving care. It would also allow HHS to redistribute unspent funds if a State has money remaining at the end of the fiscal year so more youth can be helped with existing resources. And through this bill, we will also be able to learn more about youth leaving foster care and their outcomes, which will help us develop better policies in the years ahead.  I am grateful for the opportunity we have today to support this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.

13190,topic-id,689,"Mr.President, what I would like to speak about is a new form of fossil fuel-funded climate denial spin that has just entered the climate debate. They are always up to something, and here is their latest. The Trump administration's two great scientists, Scott Pruitt and Rick Perry, the Frick and Frack of climate denial, have called for a science showdown, where climate denial and climate science can have it out for once and for all--red team versus blue team. ``Fossil fuel man'' Pruitt has even called for the showdown to be peer reviewed. Well, what is comical about that is that climate science has been peer reviewed all along. That is how it gets to be science--by going through and surviving the process of peer review by other scientists.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to Administrator Pruitt from a wide range of scientific organizations pointing out to him this very fact, that climate science is called climate science because it has been through scientific peer review.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 31, 2017.     Scott Pruitt,     Administrator, U.Environmental Protection Agency,          Washington,       Dear Administrator Pruitt: As leaders of professional      scientific societies with our collective membership of      hundreds of thousands of scientists, we are writing in      response to reports that you are working to develop a ``red      team/blue team'' process that challenges climate science.       We write to remind you of the ongoing research, testing,      evaluations, and debates that happen on a regular basis in      every scientific discipline. The peer review process itself      is a constant means of scientists putting forth research      results, getting challenged, and revising them based on      evidence. Indeed, science is a multi-dimensional, competitive      ``red team/blue team'' process whereby scientists and      scientific teams are constantly challenging one another's      findings for robustness. The current scientific understanding      of climate change is based on decades of such work, along      with overarching, carefully evaluated assessments within the      United States and internationally.       As a reflection of that work, 31 scientific societies last      year released a letter, updated from 2009, to reflect the      current scientific consensus on climate change. We urge you      to give its text consideration, along with America's Climate      Choices, the work of our premier United States scientific      body, the National Academy of       Of course, climate science, like all sciences, is an ever-     changing discipline: our knowledge is always advancing.      Robust discussion about data interpretation, methodology, and      findings are part of daily scientific discourse. That is how      science progresses. However, the integrity of the scientific      process cannot thrive when policymakers--regardless of party      affiliation--use policy disagreements as a pretext to      challenge scientific conclusions.       Given your interest in the state of climate science, we      would welcome the opportunity to meet with you to better      understand your perspective and rationale for the proposed      activity; and to discuss climate science, including which      areas are at the frontiers of scientific knowledge and which      are well-established because of thousands of studies from      multiple lines of evidence.

13191,topic-id,886,"Climate denial, on the other hand, avoids peer review as if it were Kryptonite, so this call for peer review of the contest between climate science and climate denial is almost comical, except for the evil intent behind it and, of course, the stakes. How very risky and dangerous continuing to get this climate issue wrong is for our country.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an op-ed written by John Holdren, until recently the President's climate adviser, called ``The perversity of `red-teaming' climate science.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From bostonglobe.com, July 25, 2017]            The Perversity of `Red-Teaming' Climate Science                          (By John Holdren)       EPA administrator Scott Pruitt is reportedly giving serious      consideration to investing the taxpayers' money in a ``red      team-blue team'' effort to determine whether current      scientific understandings about climate change are actually      right. The idea is that a ``red team'' made up of officials      from government agencies with responsibilities related to      climate would try to poke holes in mainstream climate      science, while a similarly constituted ``blue team'' would      have the task of defending the mainstream consensus against      this critique. Supposedly, this process would shed new light      on what is known and what is not about human influence on the      global climate. But the argument that such a process would be      helpful is some combination of naive and disingenuous.       All of science works through the continuous application of      the skeptical scrutiny of key findings by essentially      everybody working in a given field. This happens in part[[Page S4661]]     through the peer-review process that findings must survive      before being published in a scientific journal. It happens      far more widely through the scrutiny of the wider community      of experts in any given field once the findings have been      published. That scrutiny is intense, not least because      scientists make their reputations in substantial part by      providing corrections and refinements to the published      findings of others. This is the essence of the cumulative and      self-correcting nature of the scientific enterprise as a      whole.       Precisely because climate science has policy implications      that appear to challenge the status quo in global energy      supply, moreover, the degree of professional skeptical      scrutiny to which key climate-science findings have been      subjected has far exceeded even the already pervasive and      rigorous norm. Climate science has been repeatedly ``red-     teamed,'' both by groups of avowed contrarians sponsored by      right-wing groups and by the most qualified parts of the      world's scientific community. The right wing's ``red team''      efforts have consistently been characterized by brazen      cherry-picking, misrepresentation of the findings of others,      recycling of long-discredited hypotheses, and invention of      new ones destined to be discredited. Almost none of this      material has survived peer review to be published in the      respectable professional literature.       Of course, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change      itself, which works under the auspices of the UN Framework      Convention on Climate Change, can be regarded as a ``red      team-blue team'' operation, in which every conclusion must      pass muster with a huge team of expert authors and reviewers      from a wide variety of disciplines and nations (including      from Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers inclined to      be skeptical). The IPCC has produced five massive assessments      of climate science (in 1990, 1995, 2001, 2007, and 2013-14),      each more emphatic than the last in its conclusions that      human-produced greenhouses gases are changing global climate      with ongoing and growing impacts on human well-being.       Climate-change science has likewise been reviewed regularly      by committees of the US National Academy of Sciences, the      United Kingdom's Royal Society, the World Meteorological      Organization, the American Geophysical Union, and many other      reputable bodies, all of which have contributed to and      confirmed the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable      scientists on the five key points that really matter for      policy: (1) The Earth's climate is changing in ways not      explainable by the known natural influences; (2) the dominant      cause is the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere      that has resulted from burning coal, oil, and natural gas,      and from land-use change; (3) significant harm to humans and      ecosystems from these changes is already occurring; (4) the      harm will continue to grow for decades because of inertia in      the climate system and society's energy system; and (5) the      future harm will be much smaller if the world's nations take      concerted, aggressive evasive action than if they do not.       What, then, could explain the interest in a new ``red team-     blue team'' effort on climate science organized by the      federal government? Some proponents may believe, naively,      that such a rag-tag process could unearth flaws in mainstream      climate science that the rigorous, decades-long scrutiny of      the global climate-science community, through multiple layers      of formal and informal expert peer review, has somehow      missed. But I suspect that most of the advocates of the      scheme are disingenuous, aiming to get hand-picked non-     experts from federal agencies to dispute the key findings of      mainstream climate science and then assert that the verdict      of this kangaroo court has equal standing with the findings      of the most competent bodies in the national and      international scientific communities. The purpose of that, of      course, would be to create a sense of continuing uncertainty      about the science of climate change, as an underpinning of      the Trump administration's case for not addressing it.

13192,topic-id,2710,"Mr.President, let's go back to the basics here. The basic fact is that the scientific truth of climate change threatens the business model of enormous industries that spew carbon dioxide, and it challenges the ideology of rightwing fanatics who spew hatred of government. That is what the background is to all of this, and there has been a scheme for years to protect the industry's business model and the ideology of its associated cohort of fanatics. That scheme from the industry and the rightwing fanatics has been to attack climate science. They have been at it for years.  If you are a huge polluting industry or a rightwing fanatic, how do you go about attacking science? Well, you can't win a real attack on the science, precisely because the polluter nonsense could not make it through peer review. Peer review is the most basic test to enter scientific debate, but they fail at peer review because their argument is bogus, phony, and it is a front. So the scheme has always been to avoid peer review because it is a test they would fail.  If you are going to fail the peer review test, what do you do? Instead of a direct attack through peer review journals, they attack science from the side. They create a phony parallel science, a simulacrum of science that doesn't have to face peer review. Their phony science doesn't even have to be true. In fact, they don't care whether it is true; indeed, I contend that some of them know it is not true and are engaged in deliberate, knowing fraud. But, in any event, getting to the truth is not the point of this phony parallel science. The goal is political, not scientific.  What they want is for government--us--to let them keep polluting. Polluting with their product makes them big, big money, and they don't want to stop. So the goal is not to enter the scientific debate on scientific terms. This is no quest for truth; this is a quest to influence public opinion. So the polluter nonsense doesn't have to be true; it just has to sound legitimate enough to influence an uninformed public. The goal is to fool the public and mess with politics. That is how they keep the political pressure off having to clean up their act. Their battlefield is the public mind, and their goal is to pollute the public mind with false doubts about the real science.  The climate denial apparatus that Pruitt and Perry serve just needs to create the illusion that there is still scientific doubt, and it just has to create that illusion in the minds of a nonscientific audience--the average voter, people who don't know any better and shouldn't be expected to. To do this, they have set up an elaborate con game to help them foment this illusion that there is a real contest here.  Their first trick, of course, is to hide the hand of the funders who back this scheme behind innocent or respectable-sounding names. If people saw the hand of ExxonMobil or Koch Industries behind this scheme, well, the jig would be up, so they have to back front groups--dozens, indeed, of front groups. The front groups take nice, cozy words like ``heritage'' and ``heartland'' and ``prosperity,'' and they stick them on the front of the front group.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article entitled ``EPA is asking a climate denier think tank for help recruiting its `red team' '' in this effort at the conclusion of my remarks.  This article points out that they are actually recruiting one of these phony front groups, the Heartland Institute, comparing climate scientists to the Unabomber, so you know that is going to be a fair contest between climate science and climate deniers when the group involved is a fossil-funded group that has compared climate scientists to the Of course you want them in the debate, don't you? It is laughable, except for the fact that it is really not.  The other thing these groups do is they go down the shelves of American history and they grab the names of heroes and they slap these great names onto other phony front groups. Even the great GEN George Marshall has had his name slapped on a front group.  I am a big fan of General He is a hero of mine. Winston Churchill called him ``the organizer of victory'' in World War The Marshall plan saved Europe after that war. He won a Nobel Prize, deservedly. But in General Marshall's life of dedicated service to our country, he had his share of sorrows, and one of those sorrows was that he had no children. So today, there are no living children or grandchildren to defend his name. Any rascal can put General Marshall's name on a bogus enterprise, and these rascals did. It is beyond low.  So that is the first trick: Hide the polluters' hand behind an innocent or respectable-sounding name.  The second trick is camouflage. They ape real science by setting up groups with names that sound like scientific organizations. So when the United Nations convenes the real Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, they put up a Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate  They ape scientific activities. If scientific organizations have conferences, they have conferences. If scientific organizations have colloquiums, they have colloquiums. If scientific organizations publish findings, they publish findings. The difference is, it is all phony. None of it is peer reviewed. It is not real science; it is a masquerade designed to give the appearance of science without any of the rigor of peer[[Page S4662]]review and the other attributes of real science.  They even ape the publications of real science. I don't have the chart with me, but there is a publication by the legitimate U.Global Change Research Program that is entitled ``Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States.'' That is for real. It is real science. Then there is a look-alike publication called ``Addendum: Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States,'' which was cooked up by the Koch brothers-backed CATO Institute--same print, same text, same color. It virtually is a masquerade of the real item.  The first thing is to hide industry's hand behind the front group, and the second is to mask propaganda activities in camouflage that resembles actual scientific activity without having to pass any tests of scientific activity.  The last thing is to run the operation like a marketing campaign, since, well, that is what it is. You wouldn't market soap in peer-reviewed scientific journals, would you? First of all, the journals wouldn't publish it. Secondly, that is not your audience anyway. It is the same here. It doesn't do these scoundrels any good to be publishing in peer-reviewed scientific journals, even if they could get their nonsense published there. The people who read scientific journals know better. That is not their audience, and they know that they will lose in front of a scientific audience. They would shrivel up like the Wicked So they want to go right to the public with Madison Avenue-quality salesmanship and glossy messaging, marketing their dressed-up climate denial nonsense like you would market a new soap or spaghetti sauce. Go straight to TV, straight to talk radio, straight into the political debate.  The notion that the climate denial crowd now wants a scientific showdown--some ``high noon'' for climate denial--is ridiculous. First, they do not. We know they do not. They have been dodging away from peer review for years. They want peer review like the Wicked Witch wanted water.  So what are they up to?  Their gambit is yet another climate denial rhetorical trick to misdirect people to the thought that maybe climate science has not been peer reviewed either.  Climate science is nothing but peer reviewed--that is how it gets to be science--but this bit of trickery sets up in the unknowing person's mind the thought that climate science might not be peer reviewed. If our Frick and Frack of climate denial, Pruitt and Perry, had said outright that climate science is not peer reviewed, that would be a flat lie, and they would be caught out. Instead, they performed this rhetorical bank shot just to lay that suggestion out there, knowing perfectly well that it is false. It is a little like the old ``when did you stop beating your wife?'' trick. It lays out a false predicate by insinuation where the fact, itself, could not be properly asserted.  The purpose here, like the purpose of all climate denial schemes, is to buy more time for the polluters. Think how long this imaginary process of preparing for climate denial ``high noon'' will take. Oh, they could spin this out for years.  One thing you can bet is that game day will never come, but in the meantime, they have the craftily embedded lie out there that climate denial and climate science stand on an equal footing and just await peer review to decide between them, and now that lie can just hang out there, leaking its poison into the public debate.  I have to ask: Who thinks this stuff up? They have made a new art form out of propaganda. Think what a schemer you have to be to think this stuff up. That is the kind of people we are dealing with here, and in this bizarro world, Frick and Frack hold high office.  The problem is that there actually is a judge here. A real ``high noon'' will actually come. As the old saying goes, time will tell. When it comes to climate change, the laws of physics and chemistry and biology are at work. The things that CO2 concentrations do in the atmosphere are going to happen no matter what we say or believe about them. The laws of physics do not depend on political beliefs. The chemistry of what happens when seawater is exposed to more and more CO2 is going to happen, and it will follow the laws of chemistry, not our opinions or beliefs.  What we humans say or what we believe or what we have been conned into believing by the climate denial scheme will not matter at all. Our views--our opinions--are not part of the equation. Fill one room with climate deniers and fill another room with climate scientists, and the same chemistry experiment will have the same results in both rooms. Chemistry does not care about our opinions.  The way trees and animals and fish and insects and viruses and bacteria react to new temperatures and new levels of acidity and new environments we have no say in. The fossil fuel industry can cow westerners into silence or even con them into believing the industry's climate denial nonsense, and the bark beetle will not care. It will not even know that the con game is being run. The bark beetle will just keep eating its way up the warming latitudes and altitudes and killing pine forests by the hundreds of square miles.  What science does for us is give us the ability, as humans, to understand the laws of science so that we can predict what will and will not happen. Science provides mankind with headlights so that we can look ahead and see what the future portends, but turning off those headlights by denying the science or trying to distract the driver so that we are not even looking out the windshield will not change what is ahead. Whatever is coming at us is still coming at us. We just will not see it in time to steer around it in order to minimize the collision or slow down and soften the impact. We will not have time because we will have given that time to the polluters. Time is what they want--more time for the polluters to make big money.  All of this lying, all of this science denial is actually, truly, an evil thing, and the cleverer it gets with these bank shot, faux ``high noon'' showdown, tricky lies, actually, the more evil it is. The people who are behind this are doing a very grievous wrong. They are dishonorable, dishonest, and disgraceful. Time will tell us just how wicked they are.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From ThinkProgress, July 25, 2017]EPA Is Asking a Climate Denier Think Tank for Help Recruiting Its `Red                                  Team'                             (By Erin Auel)       The Environmental Protection Agency has asked the Heartland      Institute, a D.C.-based rightwing think tank that denies the      human causes of climate change, to help identify scientists      to join the agency's so-called red team-blue team effort to      ``debate'' the science of climate change, according to the      Washington       The move is part of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's      efforts to undercut established climate science within the      agency. In an interview with Reuters earlier this month,      Pruitt suggested the possibility of creating a red team to      provide ``a robust discussion'' on climate science and      determine whether humans ``are contributing to [warming].''       The Heartland Institute offers a model of what the EPA red      team might look like. Their contrarian Nongovernmental      International Panel on Climate Change--often referred to as a      red team--publishes regular volumes of a report called      ``Climate Change Reconsidered.''       Heartland communications director Jim Lakely told the      Washington Examiner the red team exercises to critique      climate science are necessary ``to critically examine what      has become alarmist dogma rather than a sober evaluation of      climate science for many years.'' But, as many scientists and      experts have noted, the peer review process for scientific      publications already requires and facilitates rigorous      examination.       For years, the Heartland Institute has spread      misinformation about climate change and attacked the      credibility of climate scientists. In 2012, the group      launched a billboard campaign with the photographs of Ted      Kaczynski (the Unabomber), Charles Manson, and Osama bin      Laden, saying those men ``still believe in global warming.''      Heartland's website at the time declared ``the most prominent      advocates of global warming aren't scientists. They are      murderers, tyrants, and madmen.''       More recently, the group announced plans to send a report      titled ``Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming'' to      every K-12 teacher and college professor in The      report incorrectly denies humans' contributions to rising      global temperatures.       Pruitt has adopted much of the misinformation that      Heartland promotes. Since being confirmed, Pruitt has      continued to question the science behind climate change and      repeated climate denier talking points claiming that humans      are not the main contributors to a warming planet.       And Heartland experts have already had an active role in      Trump's administration. Dan[[Page S4663]]     Simmons, currently an assistant to Energy Secretary Rick      Perry, is still listed as an author on Heartland's website.      Myron Ebell, a noted climate denier, led Trump's EPA      transition team and has written several pieces opposing      climate policy for       Heartland has received funding from several fossil fuel      companies, though it no longer publicly discloses its      funders. In 2012, leaked documents from the group showed the      group received contributions from the Charles Koch      Charitable Foundation and the U.Chamber of Commerce, among      others. It has also received funding from ExxonMobil to      support work to refute the human causes of climate change.       Last month, Heartland announced former Kansas congressman      Tim Huelskamp will become president of the organization.      During his political career, Huelskamp's top donor was Koch      Industries, and he received more than $250,000 in campaign      contributions from the oil and gas industry. Koch Industries      and the Koch family foundations have been one of the biggest      funders of organizations that deny humans' role in causing      climate change and oppose policies to reduce greenhouse gas      emissions.       It remains to be seen who will staff the EPA's red team.      NYU professor Steve Koonin, a scientist who formerly worked      with both BP and the Obama administration, is reportedly the      top contender. In 2014, Koonin wrote a Wall Street Journal      op-ed detailing the ways in which climate science is not      settled, which included the extent to which humans are      causing climate change, a now-frequent talking point among      Trump administration officials.       In April, Koonin published another op-ed in the Wall Street      Journal, suggesting that a Red Team/Blue Team would be ``a      step toward resolving . . . differing perceptions of climate      science.''

13372,topic-id,914,"Thank you, Mr.President, and thank you, Mr. Chairman Grassley has been a wonderful colleague in this effort. It is the culmination of years of work, including multiple committee hearings, briefings at home in Rhode Island and elsewhere, and really working the regular order of the Senate to get this done. Chairman Grassley has been both patient and persistent, and I really appreciate his leadership.  I also thank our ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Feinstein, for her work. I thank Senator Rand He would have liked to have seen a stronger bill, but it simply--as would we have, by the way. He held on for a while, hoping we could strengthen it, but it turned out there was objection to that--and he was gracious about yielding--and now we are able to move forward bipartisanly and unanimously.  The history of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act is a noble history. It is because of this law that children aren't locked up in adult prisons any longer. It is because of this law that children don't get placed in solitary confinement for extended periods or shackled when they are arrested for things like running away from home or not coming to school, but it had been a while since this bill was updated.  The last time it was reauthorized was 13 years ago, and we have learned a lot about adolescent development and the best practices for dealing with children in those 13 years. So we are moving forward today.  I look forward to working with my chairman on the broad-based criminal justice reform that he is championing in the committee, but there is no reason we shouldn't go forward with getting juvenile justice right while we move on to other areas.  I particularly want to thank him and recognize the groups involved for the patient work that was done over many years with all sorts of interested groups. We had to make this right. We wanted to minimize conflict. We wanted to maximize what we were able to accomplish, and the result is, we have over 150 organizations that have endorsed this legislation, from the ACLU to the national association that supports probation and parole officers, from Boys Town to the National Association of Counties and the National Center for Victims of  The bill focuses the way it should, on evidence-based and trauma-informed programs that have emerged in the last 13 years. It focuses on protecting juveniles who are held in adult facilities, making sure they are fully separated in sight and sound from adult inmates. It limits the narrow circumstances under which they may be confined in isolation, and it requires data-driven approaches to reduce ethnic and racial disparities.  We recognize that kids now are much more vulnerable to substance abuse issues and that they, too, face mental health challenges, and we try to bring this bill together so States have to provide appropriate treatment and recognition when the cause of what is going on in that child's life is substance abuse or a mental health challenge.  We make it a good deal harder to incarcerate for the status offenses. A status offense is an offense that wouldn't even be an offense if an adult did it. It is only because you are a child that it is even an offense at all--skipping school or running away from home and so forth. There are better ways to deal with those children than incarcerating them, and we steer in this direction, promoting the community-based alternatives to the tension.  For instance, we have community courts in Rhode Island that work really well, where the family is engaged, the child is engaged, and the community is engaged. They really learn a lesson from what they did. They have to do something helpful in order to kind of remediate themselves with their community. It has been very successful. So there are real things that can be done. Of course, separating a child from their family in order to try to improve their situation is usually something that backfires. You need to have the family engaged.  Consistent with Senator Portman's remarks, we also recognize that very often some of the times that children get in trouble is because they have been traumatized. They have been either the victim of violence themselves or witnessed violence in ways that have created trauma and, in many cases, are sadly the victims of child sex trafficking.  So we focus on States identifying and responding to those particular children to make sure, if that is what is behind what is going on, that those needs are met--simple things. We banned the use of shackles on girls once they are pregnant. It shouldn't be asking too much, and it is about time we stopped shackling girls, particularly pregnant girls.  Last, something near and dear to my chairman's heart, it improves the accountability and the oversight of the Federal grants program. I know that has been a goal he has pursued for a long time. The chairman is one of the most determined Members of the Senate when it comes to transparency and accountability, and so I am very pleased to be his partner in that particular piece of the bill.  With that, I yield the floor back to Chairman Grassley so he may take us through the formal steps of passing this law. It is a very happy moment for me, and I extend my appreciation to Chairman  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-08-01-pt1-PgS4649-4.txt,1823,CLIMATE CHANGE,2017.0,1.0,June
13277,topic-id,187,"Mr.Speaker, more than 700,000 high-skilled immigrant workers from India are in the United States today on temporary work visas. These people are working hard every day helping grow our economy and raising their children as Americans right here in our communities.  But under our legal immigration system, they are essentially here as indentured servants, stuck in a cycle of temporary work visas, unable to change jobs or even start their own businesses to create more American jobs. They are stuck because of the arbitrary 7-percent-per-nation cap on employment-based green cards.  Now there is a mother in Greenland whose unborn child will be able to obtain permanent residence in America before someone from India who has already been working here for years. That is absurd, and it is wrong.  My bill, called the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, would fix this problem. It would transition us to a first come, first served, merit-based legal immigration system. It would help these people in need, and it would help create new jobs.  Mr.Speaker, with more than 230 cosponsors, it is time to pass this bill and get this done.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgH6480-3.txt,2021,JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION REAUTHORIZAITON ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,May
13146,topic-id,439,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Korea Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act, H.1644, the KIMS  I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership in guiding this bill through the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the original cosponsors of this bill, Ranking Member Engel and Congressman Sherman, who serves alongside me as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia and the I also thank the chairman and ranking member for accepting my amendment to this bill that targets the ability of leaders like those of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that have been buying North Korean arms for years with impunity, supplying a means of income for the North Korean regime to fund their nuclear program and the regime of terror and provocations.  Mr.Speaker, North Korea's nuclear program has never been a bigger threat, and we need to respond with all the tools at our disposal. After all, the world community is against nuclear proliferation from any country, so the world community should support the United States preventing North Korea's nuclear program. If anything, Pyongyang has dramatically accelerated its belligerent behavior, conducting two nuclear tests and two dozen missile launches last year.  Speaking before the U.Security Council, Secretary Tillerson was right when he said that the threat of a North Korea nuclear attack on Seoul or Tokyo is very real. That is why it is so important that Congress, as we are doing here today, continue to apply pressure on Pyongyang, providing the administration with the tools it needs to deprive the Kim regime of the hard currency it depends on to feed its illicit weapons program.  Importantly, this measure will advance the national security interests of not just the United States and the Korean Peninsula but of the whole Asia-Pacific region and will contribute to regional security by targeting North Korea's abhorrent overseas slave labor, which is estimated at bringing in as much as $230 million each year. There are precious few nonmilitary tools left for managing the security situation on the Korean Financial sanctions are the most important and effective of these tools.  By advancing this legislation, the House will continue its critical work to ensure our country has the necessary authorities and mandates in place to ensure our financial measures are effective. A peaceful outcome on the peninsula depends on inflicting enough pressure on Kim to force him to make the hard but smart choices. This bill will affect him where it hurts--in his bank accounts.  Again, I commend Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their contributions and leadership on this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
