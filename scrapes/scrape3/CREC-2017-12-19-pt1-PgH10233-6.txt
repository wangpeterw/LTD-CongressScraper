                          THE CORKER KICKBACK

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as Republicans rammed through their tax 
gravy train for billionaires, we learned of another carve-out to 
megainvestors in real estate.
  This carve-out allows real estate businesses to take advantage of a 
new tax break, which was parachuted into the Senate bill to swing 
Republican votes, like Senator Bob Corker.
  Drain the swamp?
  The Republicans are laughing all the way to the bank.

  A tax expert at Boston College said: This is a big windfall for real 
estate developers like Donald Trump.
  So let me ask: Where's the windfall for the middle class? Where is 
the guarantee that those investors who make out big time are going to 
invest their money here in the United States of America and stop 
shipping our jobs overseas? Where is the guarantee for better wages?
  We have seen this movie before.
  Cut taxes for the rich and the economy grows?
  Well, that didn't happen under the Bush tax cuts.
  President John Kennedy said: ``If a free society cannot help the many 
who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.''
  Mr. Speaker, this Republican tax scam locks in 83 percent of the 
breaks in favor of the richest among us, but a day of reckoning is 
coming November 2018.
