                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we close out Black History 
Month. Last night at the Oscars, we saw ``Moonlight'' win the Best 
Picture, which was a real milestone for Black filmmakers. We also saw 
Viola Davis, the first African-American woman to win an Oscar, an Emmy, 
and a Tony.
  We have come a long way since the civil rights era. As a kid in 
school, I was intrigued by the period. It is when I first learned about 
standing up, fighting for people, for equality against racial 
discrimination, and injustices. The struggle is real, and it continues 
today.
  I am looking forward this weekend to going with one of my civil 
rights heroes, Congressman John Lewis, on a Faith and Politics trip to 
Selma, Montgomery, and Birmingham. May we learn from history to end the 
hatred, divisions, and the injustices that continue.
