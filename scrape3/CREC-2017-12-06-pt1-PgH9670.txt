                        IMPEACHMENT BEGINS TODAY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Green) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, again, I am honored to be 
accorded the privilege of standing in the well of the Congress of the 
United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, the American poet, Robert Frost, penned a poem with the 
words: ``Two roads diverged in the woods, and I took the one less 
traveled. . . . ''
  Mr. Speaker, in a metaphorical sense today, sometime after noon, 
shortly after 12 p.m., I will take the road less traveled.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that no one take this journey with me. I am 
absolutely convinced that this is a road worth traveling, but I have 
not asked that others travel this road and will not.
  Mr. Speaker, after noon today, I will present Articles of 
Impeachment. There are many who want to know: What is next? What will 
happen after there is a vote?
  Mr. Speaker, I will satiate those concerns after the vote. But I will 
take the road less traveled, and I believe that it will make all the 
difference.
