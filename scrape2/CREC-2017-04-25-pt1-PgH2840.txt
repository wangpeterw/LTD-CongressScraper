  RECOGNIZING THE 17TH ANNUAL MIRACLE MAKERS FASHION SHOW AND LUNCHEON

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Women's 
Committee of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Miami as the members gear up 
to celebrate the 17th annual Miracle Makers Fashion Show and Luncheon 
on April 27.
  Through its mentoring programs, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Miami has 
given our community over 50 years of proven success in providing at-
risk youth with the tools and resources to discover their true 
potential and thrive in their personal, academic, and professional 
lives.
  Thanks to the invaluable dedication of its staff and volunteers, Big 
Brothers Big Sisters of Miami has rightfully earned its reputation as 
the gold standard of mentoring youngsters.
  The upcoming Miracle Makers Fashion Show will highlight some of our 
community's most outstanding miracle makers while bringing attention to 
the positive impact that mentoring has on our youth.
  I encourage all south Floridians who want to give back to our 
community to lend their time and their support to Big Brothers Big 
Sisters of Miami. Together, we can make a brighter future for all.
