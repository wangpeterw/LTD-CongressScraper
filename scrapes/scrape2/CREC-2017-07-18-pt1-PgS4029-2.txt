                                 PRAYER

  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Today's opening prayer will be offered by 
Dr. Hance Dilbeck, senior pastor of Quail Springs Baptist Church, 
Oklahoma City, OK.
  We are very happy to welcome him here.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Lord, You made Heaven and Earth and all that dwell therein. We 
praise You as our Creator. You rule above men and nations as the King 
of Glory, and we praise You as our King.
  Father, we bow before You humbly because we believe that You judge 
men and nations, and we praise You as our judge, and we delight this 
morning that Jesus teaches us to call You our Father.
  And, Father, we give You thanks for the freedom that we have in this 
Nation. We thank You for those who fight and serve to protect those 
freedoms. We thank You for the men and women who serve here in this 
Chamber. We ask that You give them wisdom, that You guide their 
decisions.
  We pray, Father, that You give us grace as a nation and that You give 
the men and women in this Senate grace to seek justice and love mercy 
and to walk humbly with You.
  In Christ's Name we pray. Amen.
