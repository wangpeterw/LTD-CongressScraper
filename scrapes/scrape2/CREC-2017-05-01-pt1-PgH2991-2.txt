                  HONORING MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on May 1 to 
recognize Silver Star Service Banner Day. Today is a day when we honor 
the service and sacrifice of our Active-Duty men and women from all 
branches of the service from all wars. Silver Star Service Banner Day 
started in 2007 and is sponsored by the Silver Star Families of 
America, which is dedicated to supporting and assisting wounded, ill, 
injured, and dying Active-Duty veterans and their families.
  May is also National Military Appreciation Month. All month long, we 
have the opportunity to honor, remember, recognize, and appreciate 
those who serve and have served. Our military men and women continue to 
play a major role in the development of our country documented through 
a history of uncompromising honor, dedication to duty, and genuine love 
of country.
  Personally, I am a proud military dad, as my son Logan continues to 
serve in the United States Army and my daughter-in-law, Carley, is now 
a veteran. Mr. Speaker, we are the home of the free because of the 
brave, and I want to thank all who serve this great Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, only two individuals have ever offered to willingly die 
for you. One was Jesus Christ and the other was the American soldier. 
One died for your soul, the other died for your freedom.
