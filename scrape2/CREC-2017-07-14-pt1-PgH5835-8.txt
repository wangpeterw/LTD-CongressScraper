                    RECOGNIZING RICHARD DeWITT SMITH

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize 
Richard DeWitt Smith, a native of my home State of North Carolina and a 
graduate of our alma mater, North Carolina Central University.
  Tomorrow night, Richard will be honored by the NCCU Alumni 
Association with the prestigious Alumni Founder's Lifetime Achievement 
Award.
  Richard is most deserving of this great honor. Since graduating in 
1981, Richard has been a dedicated alumnus to the university, always 
exemplifying our motto of Truth and Service.

  Richard continues to serve NCCU and its alumni community in numerous 
capacities at the local, State, and national levels. He gives of his 
time, talent, and resources to help students from across the country 
succeed in obtaining a quality education from Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities.
  Richard Smith has been married to Jacqueline Beatty Smith for 28 
years. They met 40 years ago as NCCU students.
  Mr. Speaker, time does not permit me to fully describe Richard's many 
other contributions; but suffice it to say that Richard Smith is most 
deserving of this high honor--the NCCU Alumni Association 2017 Alumni 
Founder's Lifetime Achievement Award.
  I am proud of Richard Smith, and I thank him for his extraordinary 
work. I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating this great 
American hero.
