            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a 
time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the 
Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar 
No. 247, the nomination of John Gibson to be Deputy Chief Management 
Officer of the Department of Defense. I further ask that there be 60 
minutes of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form, 
and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on 
confirmation with no intervening action or debate, and that if 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon 
the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's 
action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
