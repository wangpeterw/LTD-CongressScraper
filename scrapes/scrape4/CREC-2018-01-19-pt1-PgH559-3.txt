       REACH ACROSS THE AISLE TO FIND LONG-TERM FUNDING SOLUTION

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, we are 111 days into the current budget 
year and yet no closer to a budget than we were 4 months ago. We face a 
long to-do list, including funding our military, funding the Children's 
Health Insurance Program and community health centers, protecting 
DREAMers, repealing the medical device tax, supporting disaster relief, 
and the list goes on.
  We simply can't continue kicking the can down the road with 
irresponsible temporary fixes like the ones this House passed last 
night. They hamper rather than help our military and other government 
agencies by forcing them to function in uncertainty, unable to make key 
strategic decisions and investments. This is no way to run our 
government.
  Three times in the past year I crossed the aisle to vote for these 
short-term extensions, but I have seen no willingness to work with 
Democrats, no evidence of progress, and no reason to believe we won't 
be in the exact same position 1 month from now after yet another CR.
  Enough is enough. That is why last night I voted ``no.'' It is not 
too late. I urge my Republican colleagues to reach across the aisle and 
work with Democrats to find a long-term funding solution that addresses 
our country's needs.
  Madam Speaker, I am committed and ready to work with my colleagues as 
long as it takes to achieve that responsible resolution.
