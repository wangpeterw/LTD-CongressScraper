                       GI INTERNSHIP PROGRAM ACT

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, too many of our veterans struggle to find 
a job despite their unique leadership abilities and proven skill sets.
  At the same time, I hear from small businesses that our economy 
skills gap is widening. Manufacturers want to hire, but positions sit 
unfilled because they cannot find qualified workers.
  That is why I am proud to introduce, this week, the GI Internship 
Program Act. The bill brings together these two sides, veterans and our 
small businesses, to bridge the skills gap and expand the job 
opportunities available to those who served our Nation.
  Since 1944, we have committed to providing our returning military men 
and women a quality education, but not every lesson is best learned in 
the classroom. This legislation allows veterans to receive their post-
9/11 GI Bill benefit as a stipend while participating in a qualifying 
6-month to 1-year internship or apprenticeship, at no additional cost 
to taxpayers.
  I am proud to introduce this bipartisan bill with my colleague from 
Florida, Congressman Ted Yoho. I encourage our colleagues to join us in 
support of our veterans and manufacturers on this win-win commonsense 
legislation.
