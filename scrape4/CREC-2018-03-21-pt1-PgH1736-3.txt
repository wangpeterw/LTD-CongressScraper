                   PROTECT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION

  (Mr. WELCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it: through their words 
and actions, President Trump and his allies are doing everything they 
can to destroy the independent investigation of Special Counsel Robert 
Mueller through provocative tweets: a witch hunt;
  Through reckless actions: firing Director Comey and Assistant 
Director McCabe; and
  Through provocative statements: his personal attorney calling for an 
end to the investigation.
  The question, Mr. Speaker, is not what the President wants to do or 
may do. The question is: Will Congress do what it must do, which is 
protect the Mueller investigation?
  A number of us have a bill that would do just that. Our bill would 
require a three-judge panel to approve any dismissal of Mr. Mueller.
  Mr. Speaker, no American is above the law, no Member of Congress is 
above the law, and no member of the executive branch is above the law, 
including President Trump.
  Mr. Speaker, let the House vote on our bill. Make each one of us be 
accountable to our constituents on the rule of law.
  Will we vote to protect the Mueller investigation or will we 
acquiesce to the President's threats and temper tantrums?
  Mr. Speaker, let us vote.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
