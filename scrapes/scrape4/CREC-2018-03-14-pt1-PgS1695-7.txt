                             INFRASTRUCTURE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter, 
this will be a busy day for the Senate. Today, Senator Thune and our 
colleagues on the Commerce Committee will continue their hearings on 
rebuilding America's infrastructure.
  Notably, five Cabinet Secretaries will testify: Secretaries of Labor, 
Commerce, Energy, Agriculture, and Transportation will all share the 
administration's ideas for cutting redtape, streamlining permitting, 
and aligning Federal resources with local needs.
  I am grateful for the Trump administration's commitment to this 
issue, and I hope this week's hearings, along with the ongoing work of 
our colleagues on Environment and Public Works, Appropriations, and 
other committees, will keep building momentum.
  Bipartisan results are achievable this year, starting with billions 
of added funding for infrastructure improvements in the budget 
agreement, and extending to the work of many committees in the months 
ahead.
