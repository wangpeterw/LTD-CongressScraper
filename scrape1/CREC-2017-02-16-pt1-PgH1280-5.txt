                      CERBERUS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, before President Trump and Steve Bannon 
bring in a Wall Street billionaire to delve into our Nation's most 
classified intelligence, the American people have a right to know the 
facts about who he and his firm are.
  If you believe in the United States military, as I do, and not simply 
cashing it out to private guns for hire, then we would best pay 
attention to Stephen Feinberg, CEO of Cerberus, who is to be tasked 
with leading a review of our U.S. intelligence agencies.
  Cerberus also owns DynCorp, which is in a legal dispute over a $10 
billion State Department contract for operations in foreign countries.
  The Director of Homeland Security, retired General Kelly, received 
$166,000 as an adviser to DynCorp prior to his Cabinet appointment. 
Simply put, Cerberus profits off the privatization of war.
  Handing the keys to our intelligence agencies over to Wall Street is 
dangerous. Privatization of our homeland security and Armed Forces 
jeopardizes our national security. It is critical we stand together, 
take action to demand transparency, prevail for the sake of future 
generations, and prevent the siphoning of funds intended for our 
military.
  Before any Wall Street speculator sets foot on our Nation's most 
precious security turf, the American people and our military need 
complete disclosure and divestiture of all Cerberus' and Mr. Feinberg's 
holdings.
