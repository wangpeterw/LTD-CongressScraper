  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the outstanding service of Mrs. Louise Johnson, this year's recipient 
of the Friends of the Fair Award from the Clinton County Fair.
  Mrs. Johnson has dedicated herself to the people and organizations of 
Clinton County for many years, particularly the Clinton County Fair.

co-chair for Open Show for 19 years, and created the Sizzling Senior

serving residents at Haven Skilled Rehabilitation and Nursing, and 
assisting at Lock Haven Hospital.
  Mr. Speaker, the time and dedication Mrs. Johnson has given to her 
community is truly inspiring. I am so proud to congratulate her on this 
well-deserved award.
  I congratulate Mrs. Johnson, and I thank her for all that she has 
given in services to the communities of both Centre and Clinton 
Counties.
