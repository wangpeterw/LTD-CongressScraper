                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Scott Wilson, Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Gracious and loving God, send Your spirit once again to these Halls 
of power, where so many have come to participate in the difficult but 
glorious process of governing by consent of the people. Be especially 
with those blessed with this awesome authority, that they may wield it 
with humility and grace.
  Amid the many voices of our world and our culture, may we strain to 
hear clearly a word from You, the One who desires justice and mercy. 
And may we also be attuned to listen to one another, to hear each other 
with wisdom and understanding.
  To that end, Lord, be with those who are in their home districts, and 
grant them peace as they dialogue with their neighbors, whether they be 
friend or foe. Help us to be strengthened by the good we see in others. 
Help us seek a way that is pleasing to You.
  Amen.
