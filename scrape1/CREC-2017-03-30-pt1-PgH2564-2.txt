            INVESTIGATING RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE ON OUR ELECTION

  (Ms. VELAZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, Russia's efforts to influence our 
election constitutes a direct assault on our democracy. These alarming 
events must be thoroughly investigated. In particular, we must 
determine if any Americans collaborated in these attacks and are 
legally culpable.
  Sadly, the House Intelligence Committee chairman is either unwilling 
or incapable of conducting a fair investigation. How can Mr. Nunes run 
this investigation if he is briefing the President before talking with 
members of his committee? How can he be secretly meeting with so-called 
sources at the White House?
  Madam Speaker, the American people need to know that democracy is 
intact, and that requires a full, fair, and impartial investigation.
  Since December, I have repeatedly called for the Department of 
Justice to appoint a special counsel. I have also cosponsored 
legislation to create a bipartisan commission to investigate.
  The bottom line is this: Chairman Nunes has lost all credibility. He 
must recuse himself. We need a real investigation. Appoint a special 
counsel now.
