                   REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN BAD TAX POLICY

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax plan that provides 
massive, permanent tax cuts to the largest corporations and tax 
increases for millions of middle class Americans is bad tax policy.
  Let's be honest about what it does. This $1.5 trillion tax cut will 
trigger cuts to domestic programs in the amount of $150 billion every 
year, including $25 billion in cuts to Medicare, with 55 million 
Americans who rely on it being put at risk if this bill becomes law.
  Mr. Speaker, it is bad enough that this tax policy favors the largest 
corporations over middle class Americans, but to effect these kinds of 
massive cuts by tricking the American people in order to try to do it 
is shameful.
  We have to defeat this bill, prevent these massive cuts, and protect 
the 55 million Americans on Medicare from a $25 billion cut.
