          COMMENDING JARROD DAVIS FOR HIS EAGLE SCOUT PROJECT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend 
Jarrod Davis, of Blossburg, Pennsylvania, for his Eagle Scout project 
in honor of our Nation's veterans.
  Jarrod, the grandson of a World War II veteran, wanted his Eagle 
Scout project to benefit veterans, so he began working in the spring on 
a reflection project outside the Veterans Center in Charleston 
Township, in Tioga County.
  He collected donations to assist with establishing a flagpole, black 
metal benches, and a monument. At the project's completion, he donated 
the remaining funds to the Veterans Affairs Outreach Fund.
  Jarrod worked with 10 volunteers on the project for 3 months, and he 
spent about 80 hours working on his Eagle Scout project. The flagpole 
and the reflection area were finished on April 21.
  Jarrod, who graduated from North Penn-Liberty High School in June, 
now works at Sullivan Farms in Mainesburg. His project was dedicated 
earlier this month, on the 76th anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day on 
December 7.
  Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of Jarrod, his patriotism, and his respect 
for those who serve. I wholeheartedly commend Jarrod Davis on this 
outstanding project.
