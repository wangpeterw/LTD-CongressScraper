                        OPPOSE OFFSHORE DRILLING

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Trump administration 
announced a proposal to open our Nation's Federal waters to potential 
oil and gas exploration.
  Immediately, leaders and lawmakers from the West Coast to the East 
Coast, and Republicans and Democrats from the leftwing to the rightwing 
came out against such a proposal for offshore oil drilling.
  Being from the central coast of California, I know how important our 
oceans and our coastlines are for our economy, our businesses, our 
communities, and our families. That is why we have long fought to 
protect our coast from drilling with zoning laws and limiting onshore 
oil infrastructure to the designation of the Monterey Bay National 
Marine Sanctuary, and legislation to protect our oceans and coasts.
  I believe that, in Congress, we will work to uphold those laws and 
legacy of protection and preservation, but the Trump administration 
needs to hear from you. So I ask my constituents and all Americans to 
share why they also oppose this proposal for oil drilling off our 
coast. Participate in the public comment period that is now open until 
March 9, for it is your opportunity to speak directly to the 
administration, to stand up for your community, and to protect our 
environment and our future.
