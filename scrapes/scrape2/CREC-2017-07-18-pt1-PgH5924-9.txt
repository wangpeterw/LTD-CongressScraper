      CONGRATULATIONS TO MASJID AL-HAQQ ON THEIR 25TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Masjid Al-Haqq in Newark, New 
Jersey, on its 25th anniversary.
  Founded on June 18, 1992, and headed by Imam Muhammad, Masjid Al-Haqq 
has dedicated 25 years of service to the community, and I want to thank 
them for an outstanding job.
  Masjid Al-Haqq provides the most reputable Muslim journal newspapers 
on a weekly basis in the city of Newark, without fake news, and sends a 
large contingent of Newark Muslims to the Muslim Convention held in 
Chicago each year during Labor Day weekend.
  Every December, the Masjid also holds a ``Time to Reflect'' weekend, 
where the community gathers for workshops and family activities. The 
services they provide impact the lives of many around our community.
  I once again offer my sincere congratulations for a job well done. 
Happy 25th anniversary.
