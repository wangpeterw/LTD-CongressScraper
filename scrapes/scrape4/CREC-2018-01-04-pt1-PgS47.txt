  Mr. CRUZ (for himself, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cotton, Mrs.

                              S. Res. 367

       Whereas on December 28, 2017, citizens began protesting the 
     Government of Iran across the country in the cities and towns 
     of Dorud, Khomaini Shahr, Najafabad, Qahdarijan, Tehran, and 
     Tuyserkan;
       Whereas so far 20 people have been killed and 450 have been 
     arrested since demonstrations first began;
       Whereas the United States is committed to promoting 
     universal human rights, specifically freedom of speech and 
     freedom of assembly;
       Whereas the Government of Iran has provided monetary 
     support to terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and 
     Hamas; and
       Whereas the citizens of Iran deserve the support of the 
     international community in their pursuit of a democratic 
     government that respects human rights and freedoms: Now, 
     therefore be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) condemns the Government of Iran--
       (A) for its funding of terrorist organizations and 
     activities;

       (C) the suppression of communication through interference 
     with internet applications such as Instagram, Facebook, 
     Telegram and Twitter; and
       (2) reaffirms--
       (A) the commitment of the United States to preserving and 
     promoting the freedoms of speech and assembly as universal 
     rights; and
       (B) the support of the United States for the citizens of 
     Iran to establish a freely elected, democratic system.
