     with persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support 
     terrorism) in October 2007 for its support of terrorism.
       (3) The IRGC, not just the IRGC-QF, is responsible for

     ballistic missile program.

     agents, or affiliates of the IRGC.

     subsection are sanctions applicable with respect to a foreign 
     person pursuant to Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 
     note; relating to blocking property and prohibiting 
     transactions with persons who commit, threaten to commit, or 
     support terrorism).
