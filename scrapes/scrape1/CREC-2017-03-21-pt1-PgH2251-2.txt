     LOSING HEALTHCARE COVERAGE UNDER THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Ms. BASS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, since January I have received hundreds of 
messages from constituents who are panicked that they will lose 
healthcare coverage with the Republican plan, where people will pay 
more for less.
  Although the talking points of the Republican plan references access 
to health care, care will only be accessible for people with enough 
money to pay.
  A message I received from Vera Caldas:

       My husband has leukemia, and if it wasn't for the ACA, he 
     would be dead by now. I am living in fear that if he loses 
     ObamaCare, that will mean his death sentence since he won't 
     be able to afford insurance to continue his treatment.

  A message from Lee Portillo:

       The ACA allowed my wife to start her Silicon Valley beach 
     business in Venice, California and still have access to 
     health care. The ACA is pro small entrepreneur and gives us 
     the freedom to work on our own and still have insurance.

  My constituents, like millions across the Nation, are afraid they 
might be one of the 14 million people who will lose coverage if the 
Republican plan is passed.
