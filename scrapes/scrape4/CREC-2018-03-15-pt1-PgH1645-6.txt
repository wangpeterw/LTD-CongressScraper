 THANKING PENN STATE STUDENTS FOR THEIR FIGHT AGAINST PEDIATRIC CANCER

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Penn 
State students for their fight against pediatric cancer.
  THON, a 46-hour dance marathon, took place February 16 through 18, 
and students raised $10,151,663 for the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn 
State Children's Hospital. Four Diamonds ensures that families that are 
battling pediatric cancer are not faced with any costs, allowing them 
to fully focus on the needs of their child.
  THON is the largest student-run student philanthropy in the world, 
but it all began in 1973 by a group of students looking to add 
excitement to a dreary February in central Pennsylvania and for a way 
to give back to the community. Today, THON engages more than 15,000 
students each year and has inspired other university, high school, 
middle school, and elementary school students across the Nation to 
start dance marathons of their own, all in hopes of conquering 
pediatric cancer.

  Mr. Speaker, I am in awe of the power of our Penn State students and 
their care and concern for others, and I thank them for this 
outstanding contribution to the community.
