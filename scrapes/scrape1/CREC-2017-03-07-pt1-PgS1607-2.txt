                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Lord, in whose hands is the life of every living thing, we depend 
upon Your strength and might.
  Manifest Yourself to our Senators, directing their steps and bringing 
them to Your chosen destination. Without Your leading, they will be 
like ships without rudders, but with You directing, they cannot fail to 
fulfill Your purposes. Take them in the direction that will enable them 
to positively affect the lives of the heavy laden, the sorrowful, and 
the suffering.
  Fill their hearts with the deep compassion needed to enable Your 
Kingdom to come and Your will to be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. 
Lord, use them to hasten the coming of Your Kingdom of justice and 
truth.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
