                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, who sends showers to soften the Earth, You are the source of 
life and joy. You have challenged us to number our days, not our weeks, 
months, or years. Give us wisdom to comprehend the brevity and 
uncertainty of our life's journey. Forgive us when we boast about 
tomorrow, forgetting that our times are in Your hands.
  Today, bless our lawmakers and their staffs. Remind them that they 
belong to You and that You will order their steps. As they wrestle with 
complex issues, help them seek Your wisdom and guidance. Lord, empower 
them as stewards of Your bounty, making them faithful in the vocation 
to which You have called them.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
