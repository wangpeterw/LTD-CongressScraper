       (1) The IRGC is subject to sanctions pursuant to Executive

     ballistic missile program.
       (b) In General.--Beginning on the date that is 90 days

     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.

       This title may be cited as the ``Countering Russian 
     Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017''.

 Subtitle A--Sanctions and Other Measures With Respect to the Russian 
                               Federation

     SEC. 211. FINDINGS.

       Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) On March 6, 2014, President Barack Obama issued 
     Executive Order 13660 (79 Fed. Reg. 13493; relating to 
     blocking property of certain persons contributing to the 
     situation in Ukraine), which authorizes the Secretary of the 
     Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to 
     impose sanctions on those determined to be undermining 
     democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine or 
     threatening the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and 
     territorial integrity of Ukraine. President Obama 
     subsequently issued Executive Order 13661 (79 Fed. Reg. 
     15535; relating to blocking property of additional persons 
     contributing to the situation in Ukraine) and Executive Order 
     13662 (79 Fed. Reg. 16169; relating to blocking property of 
     additional persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine) 
     to expand sanctions on certain persons contributing to the 
     situation in Ukraine.
       (2) On December 18, 2014, the Ukraine Freedom Support Act 
     of 2014 was enacted (Public Law 113-272; 22 U.S.C. 8921 et 
     seq.), which includes provisions directing the President to 
     impose sanctions on foreign persons that the President 
     determines to be entities owned or controlled by the 
     Government of the Russian Federation or nationals of the 
     Russian Federation that manufacture, sell, transfer, or 
     otherwise provide certain defense articles into Syria.
       (3) On April 1, 2015, President Obama issued Executive 
     Order 13694 (80 Fed. Reg. 18077; relating to blocking the 
     property of certain persons engaging in significant malicious 
     cyber-enabled activities), which authorizes the Secretary of 
     the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and 
     the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on persons 
     determined to be engaged in malicious cyber-hacking.
       (4) On July 26, 2016, President Obama approved a 
     Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident 
     Coordination, which states, ``certain cyber incidents that 
     have significant impacts on an entity, our national security, 
     or the broader economy require a unique approach to response 
     efforts''.
       (5) On December 29, 2016, President Obama issued an annex 
     to Executive Order 13694, which authorized sanctions on the 
     following entities and individuals:
       (A) The Main Intelligence Directorate (also known as 
     Glavnoe Razvedyvatel'noe Upravlenie or the GRU) in Moscow, 
     Russian Federation.
       (B) The Federal Security Service (also known as Federalnaya 
     Sluzhba Bezopasnosti or the FSB) in Moscow, Russian 
     Federation.
       (C) The Special Technology Center (also known as STLC, Ltd. 
     Special Technology Center St. Petersburg) in St. Petersburg, 
     Russian Federation.
       (D) Zorsecurity (also known as Esage Lab) in Moscow, 
     Russian Federation.
       (E) The autonomous noncommercial organization known as the 
     Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing 
     Systems (also known as ANO PO KSI) in Moscow, Russian 
     Federation.
       (F) Igor Valentinovich Korobov.
       (G) Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov.
       (H) Igor Olegovich Kostyukov.
       (I) Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev.
       (6) On January 6, 2017, an assessment of the United States 
     intelligence community entitled, ``Assessing Russian 
     Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections'' stated, 
     ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence 
     campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential 
     election.'' The assessment warns that ``Moscow will apply 
     lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the 
     U.S. Presidential election to future influence efforts 
     worldwide, including against U.S. allies and their election 
     processes''.

     SEC. 212. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that the President--
       (1) should continue to uphold and seek unity with European 
     and other key partners on sanctions implemented against the 
     Russian Federation, which have been effective and 
     instrumental in countering Russian aggression in Ukraine;
       (2) should engage to the fullest extent possible with 
     partner governments with regard to closing loopholes, 
     including the allowance of extended prepayment for the 
     delivery of goods and commodities and other loopholes, in 
     multilateral and unilateral restrictive measures against the 
     Russian Federation, with the aim of maximizing alignment of 
     those measures; and
       (3) should increase efforts to vigorously enforce 
     compliance with sanctions in place as of the date of the 
     enactment of this Act with respect to the Russian Federation 
     in response to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, cyber 
     intrusions and attacks, and human rights violators in the 
     Russian Federation.

     Subtitle B--Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia

     SEC. 251. FINDINGS.

       Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The Government of the Russian Federation has sought to 
     exert influence throughout Europe and Eurasia, including in 
     the former states of the Soviet Union, by providing resources 
     to political parties, think tanks, and civil society groups 
     that sow distrust in democratic institutions and actors, 
     promote xenophobic and illiberal views, and otherwise 
     undermine European unity. The Government of the Russian 
     Federation has also engaged in well-documented corruption 
     practices as a means toward undermining and buying influence 
     in European and Eurasian countries.
       (2) The Government of the Russian Federation has largely 
     eliminated a once-vibrant Russian-language independent media 
     sector and severely curtails free and independent media 
     within the borders of the Russian Federation. Russian-
     language media organizations that are funded and controlled 
     by the Government of the Russian Federation and disseminate 
     information within and outside of the Russian Federation 
     routinely traffic in anti-Western disinformation, while few 
     independent, fact-based media sources provide objective 
     reporting for Russian-speaking audiences inside or outside of 
     the Russian Federation.
       (3) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to 
     violate its commitments under the Memorandum on Security 
     Assurances in connection with Ukraine's Accession to the 
     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at 
     Budapest December 5, 1994, and the Conference on Security and 
     Co-operation in Europe Final Act, concluded at Helsinki 
     August 1, 1975 (commonly referred to as the ``Helsinki Final 
     Act''), which laid the ground-work for the establishment of 
     the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, of 
     which the Russian Federation is a member, by its illegal 
     annexation of Crimea in 2014, its illegal occupation of South 
     Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia in 2008, and its ongoing 
     destabilizing activities in eastern Ukraine.
       (4) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to 
     ignore the terms of the August 2008 ceasefire agreement 
     relating to Georgia, which requires the withdrawal of Russian 
     Federation troops, free access by humanitarian groups to the 
     regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and monitoring of the 
     conflict areas by the European Union Monitoring Mission.
       (5) The Government of the Russian Federation is failing to 
     comply with the terms of the Minsk Agreement to address the 
     ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, signed in Minsk, 
     Belarus, on February 11, 2015, by the leaders of Ukraine, 
     Russia, France, and Germany, as well as the Minsk Protocol, 
     which was agreed to on September 5, 2014.
       (6) The Government of the Russian Federation is--
       (A) in violation of the Treaty between the United States of 
     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the 
     Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range 
     Missiles, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and entered 
     into force June 1, 1988 (commonly known as the ``INF 
     Treaty''); and
       (B) failing to meet its obligations under the Treaty on 
     Open Skies, done at Helsinki March 24, 1992, and entered into 
     force January 1, 2002 (commonly known as the ``Open Skies 
     Treaty'').

     SEC. 252. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the Government of the Russian Federation bears 
     responsibility for the continuing violence in Eastern 
     Ukraine, including the death on April 24, 2017, of Joseph 
     Stone, a citizen of the United States working as a monitor 
     for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;
       (2) the President should call on the Government of the 
     Russian Federation--
       (A) to withdraw all of its forces from the territories of 
     Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova;
       (B) to return control of the borders of those territories 
     to their respective governments; and
       (C) to cease all efforts to undermine the popularly elected 
     governments of those countries;
       (3) the Government of the Russian Federation has applied, 
     and continues to apply, to the countries and peoples of 
     Georgia and Ukraine, traditional uses of force, intelligence 
     operations, and influence campaigns, which represent clear 
     and present threats to the countries of Europe and Eurasia;
       (4) in response, the countries of Europe and Eurasia should 
     redouble efforts to build resilience within their 
     institutions, political systems, and civil societies;
       (5) the United States supports the institutions that the 
     Government of the Russian Federation seeks to undermine, 
     including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the 
     European Union;
       (6) a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization is critical 
     to maintaining peace and security in Europe and Eurasia;
       (7) the United States should continue to work with the 
     European Union as a partner against aggression by the 
     Government of the Russian Federation, coordinating aid 
     programs, development assistance, and other counter-Russian 
     efforts;
       (8) the United States should encourage the establishment of 
     a commission for media freedom within the Council of Europe, 
     modeled on the Venice Commission regarding rule of law 
     issues, that would be chartered to provide governments with 
     expert recommendations on maintaining legal and regulatory 
     regimes supportive of free and independent media and an 
     informed citizenry able to distinguish between fact-based 
     reporting, opinion, and disinformation;
       (9) in addition to working to strengthen the North Atlantic 
     Treaty Organization and the European Union, the United States 
     should work with the individual countries of Europe and 
     Eurasia--
       (A) to identify vulnerabilities to aggression, 
     disinformation, corruption, and so-called hybrid warfare by 
     the Government of the Russian Federation;
       (B) to establish strategic and technical plans for 
     addressing those vulnerabilities;
       (C) to ensure that the financial systems of those countries 
     are not being used to shield illicit financial activity by 
     officials of the Government of the Russian Federation or 
     individuals in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle who 
     have been enriched through corruption;
       (D) to investigate and prosecute cases of corruption by 
     Russian actors; and
       (E) to work toward full compliance with the Convention on 
     Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in 
     International Business Transactions (commonly referred to as 
     the ``Anti-Bribery Convention'') of the Organization for 
     Economic Co-operation and Development; and
       (10) the President of the United States should use the 
     authority of the President to impose sanctions under--
       (A) the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 
     2012 (title IV of Public Law 112-208; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note); 
     and
       (B) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act 
     (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328; 22 U.S.C. 
     2656 note).

     SEC. 253. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

       The United States, consistent with the principle of ex 
     injuria jus non oritur, supports the policy known as the 
     ``Stimson Doctrine'' and thus does not recognize territorial 
     changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions 
     and occupations of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Eastern 
     Ukraine, and Transnistria.

     assess--
       (A) the potential efficacy of requiring banking regulators 
     to establish a pilot program to provide technical assistance 
     to depository institutions and credit unions that wish to 
     provide account services to money services businesses serving 
     individuals in Somalia;
       (B) whether such a pilot program could be a model for 
     improving the ability of United States persons to make 
     legitimate funds transfers through transparent and easily 
     monitored channels while preserving strict compliance with 
     the Bank Secrecy Act (Public Law 91-508; 84 Stat. 1114) and

     confidential supervisory information, the potential impact of 
     allowing money services businesses to share certain State 
     examination information with depository institutions and 
     credit unions, or whether another appropriate mechanism could 
     be identified to allow a similar exchange of information to 
     give the depository institutions and credit unions a better 
     understanding of whether an individual money services 
     business is adequately meeting its anti-money laundering and 
     counter-terror financing obligations to combat money 
     laundering, the financing of terror, or related illicit 
     finance.

     SEC. 292. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF 
                   ARTICLE 5 OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The principle of collective defense of the North 
     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is immortalized in 
     Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in which members 
     pledge that ``an armed attack against one or more of them in 
     Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against 
     them all''.
       (2) For almost 7 decades, the principle of collective 
     defense has effectively served as a strategic deterrent for 
     the member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
     and provided stability throughout the world, strengthening 
     the security of the United States and all 28 other member 
     nations.
       (3) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in 
     New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, the Alliance agreed 
     to invoke Article 5 for the first time, affirming its 
     commitment to collective defense.
       (4) Countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
     Organization have made historic contributions and sacrifices 
     while combating terrorism in Afghanistan through the 
     International Security Assistance Force and the Resolute 
     Support Mission.
       (5) The recent attacks in the United Kingdom underscore the 
     importance of an international alliance to combat hostile 
     nation states and terrorist groups.
       (6) At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, the member countries 
     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization decided that all 
     countries that are members of NATO would spend an amount 
     equal to 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense 
     by 2024.
       (7) Collective defense unites the 29 members of the North 
     Atlantic Treaty Organization, each committing to protecting 
     and supporting one another from external adversaries, which 
     bolsters the North Atlantic Alliance.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--
       (1) to express the vital importance of Article 5 of the 
     North Atlantic Treaty, the charter of the North Atlantic 
     Treaty Organization, as it continues to serve as a critical 
     deterrent to potential hostile nations and terrorist 
     organizations;
       (2) to remember the first and only invocation of Article 5 
     by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in support of the 
     United States after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
     2001;
       (3) to affirm that the United States remains fully 
     committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and will 
     honor its obligations enshrined in Article 5; and
       (4) to condemn any threat to the sovereignty, territorial 
     integrity, freedom, or democracy of any country that is a 
     member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each 
will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.


                             General Leave

  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their 
remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill represents a very broad, bipartisan House-
Senate agreement that the United States must enforce tougher sanctions 
against North Korea, against Russia, against Iran.
  I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for his determined and excellent work 
on this legislation. This is a very important bill.
  These three regimes in different parts of the world are threatening 
vital U.S. interests and they are destabilizing their neighbors. It is 
well past time that we forcefully respond.
  Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded its neighbor, Ukraine, 
seizing its territory and destabilizing its government. It poses a 
threat to our NATO allies in Europe, as Moscow works to undermine 
democratic values with determination and sophistication, as U.S. 
intelligence agencies have made clear. This former KGB colonel 
attempted to interfere with our own election. Left unchecked, Russia is 
sure to continue its aggression.
  Putin's forces continue to prop up the murderous Assad regime in 
Syria, prolonging a deadly conflict that has driven tens of millions of 
people from their homes, while enabling the use of chemical weapons and 
other systematic human rights abuses against the people of Syria.
  The Russia sanctions in this bill are substantially similar to those 
that overwhelmingly passed the other body. They give the administration 
important economic leverage, they give it diplomatic leverage by 
targeting the things that matter to Vladimir Putin and that matter to 
his allies the most, and that is their corrupt efforts to profit from 
the country's oil wealth and their ability to sell weapons overseas.
  To focus their impact, we clarified several provisions that could 
have inadvertently handed Russian companies control of global energy 
projects and impacted pipelines that our European allies rely on in an 
effort to end their dependence on Russian gas. So this strengthens the 
bill.
  To ensure these economic sanctions remain in place as long as Putin's 
aggression continues, this bill empowers Congress to review and to 
disapprove any sanctions relief. This strong oversight is necessary, it 
is appropriate. After all, it is Congress that the Constitution 
empowers to regulate commerce with foreign nations.
  Mr. Speaker, Russia has found a willing partner in Iran. The regime's 
Iranian Revolutionary Guard are fighting alongside Russian forces in 
Syria. At the same time, Tehran continues to threaten Israel by 
providing funding and advanced rockets and missiles to Hezbollah. 
Hezbollah is its leading terrorist proxy. It continues to hold 
Americans hostage, while developing intercontinental ballistic missiles 
capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
  To strengthen the U.S. response to the threat from Iran, this bill 
includes provisions originally introduced by my counterpart, Senator 
Corker, which increase sanctions on those involved in the regime's 
human rights abuses and its support for terrorism, as well as its 
efforts on the ballistic missile program, which the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard forces control.
  Finally, I am proud that this bill includes the text of H.R. 1644, 
the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act, which we 
passed in May. We passed it here out of the House by a vote of 419-1. 
These provisions, which were strengthened in consultation with the 
other body, expand

[[Page H6262]]

sanctions targeting North Korea's nuclear weapons program, but they 
also go after those around the world who employ North Korean slave 
labor.
  This is a human rights abuse. It is one that operates by having a 
situation where the indentured workers are fed, but the check, instead 
of going to the workers, goes to the regime, and that money then goes 
into the nuclear weapons program. It is estimated that this earns 
hundreds of millions of dollars for the regime in hard currency.
  So with every test, Kim Jong-un's regime comes closer to being able 
to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile that is capable of reaching the 
U.S. mainland. We simply cannot pass up an opportunity to increase 
pressure in response to this threat.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I want to, first 
of all, thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for all the hard 
work that has gone into this legislation so far. I want to especially 
thank our chairman, Ed Royce, who has been my partner on this committee 
for nearly 5 years. We have passed excellent legislation. The 
legislation today just adds to it, and it shows what you can do when 
you work in a bipartisan way, so I want to thank the chairman for all 
his hard work and all his courtesies.
  Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I certainly plan to vote for it, 
but it seems we may be on the floor before we have ironed out all the 
differences with the other body. I hope that is not the case.
  In particular, there have been issues with the North Korea sanctions. 
It was another Royce-Engel bill, which already passed in the House and, 
frankly, should have been taken up by the other body on a separate 
track; instead, it is now put into this bill. I hope we don't face 
further delays when this bill gets back to the other House.

  Our job isn't done, obviously, until we get this thing across the 
finish line; and we need to do that because this bill is critical to 
our national security.
  It does far more than just send a message to leaders in Russia, Iran, 
and North Korea. It exacts a heavy price for their aggressive and 
destabilizing behavior.
  Just like the bill we already passed, this legislation would update 
and expand our sanctions on North Korea, closing loopholes that have 
allowed money to flow to the Kim regime, funding its illegal weapons 
program. It would crack down on the trading partners, banks, and 
shipping vessels that enable the regime, and go after the regime's most 
lucrative enterprises, whether exported goods or the pilfered wages of 
North Korean laborers sent abroad to work.
  With respect to Iran, this bill would go after so many of the things 
Iran's leaders do to drive violence and instability, from Tehran's 
ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism to the regime's 
abhorrent human rights record and efforts to build up its military. I 
have said this again and again, that we need to hold the regime's feet 
to the fire on all these issues. This bill does exactly that.
  Finally, on Russia, this bill is a strong, direct response to 
Vladimir Putin's efforts to undermine American democracy. It imposes 
new sanctions on those who want to do business with Putin's cronies or 
with Russia's military or intelligence. It strengthens existing 
sanctions for Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and armed 
intervention in eastern Ukraine. It pushes back against Russia's 
cybercrimes, including the hacking of our election to help Donald 
Trump--a story which Congress and the special counsel are still trying 
to get to the bottom of--as well as Putin's support for the murderous 
Assad regime in Syria. And it gives Congress a strong oversight role in 
making sure that these Russian sanctions are not lifted prematurely.
  This administration has shown over and over that they are willing to 
cozy up to Putin, but here is the truth: Russia is not our ally. Putin 
wants to harm the United States, splinter our alliances, and undermine 
Western democracy. This Congress will not allow him to succeed, so I am 
glad to support this bipartisan bill.
  I thank the chairman once again. We need to keep working to make sure 
this bill gets to the President's desk.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1445

  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), and I just want to thank him for his 
good work to strengthen the bill, as he will discuss, and for his focus 
on pipelines that primarily carry oil and gas through Russia that 
compete with Russian gas and drives down the price of gas.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of increased 
sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea. I thank Chairman Royce and 
Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their leadership on this issue. I cannot 
overstate the importance of sending a strong message to our adversaries 
that there will be consequences for their bad behavior.
  Back in October of last year, at the height of the Presidential 
campaign, I was briefed by our intelligence community. They told me 
that Russia engaged in a blatant effort to meddle in our domestic 
affairs and, specifically, our democratic process. I was an outspoken 
supporter of the need for a strong response then, and I remain so now.
  However, in the process of making Russia pay an economic cost for 
their bad behavior, we must ensure we are not harming U.S. interests at 
home and abroad.
  I want to thank Chairman Royce for clarifying that Section 232 of 
this bill only applies to Russian energy export pipelines. We should 
not be in the business of sanctioning pipelines that help provide 
energy independence from Russia. Putin uses this as a tool to provide 
political leverage over his neighbors.
  So, again, I want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership in 
working with me on this, I think, clarification to the Senate companion 
and for his leadership in the House on this important issue.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. Cicilline), my colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3364, the 
Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act. I thank my colleagues, 
Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, for all of their work, 
together with the Senate, to reach this important agreement.
  This legislation will ensure that Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and 
those who seek to help them, will suffer consequences for their bad 
behavior. Passage of this legislation is important to hold Iran 
accountable for its support for terrorism, human rights violations, and 
continued defiance of international treaties, including on ballistic 
missiles.
  Today we are taking an important step toward holding the Iranian 
Government, including the IRGC, and anyone who seeks to support them, 
accountable for their bad actions. Anyone who contributes to Iran's 
ballistic missile program, supplies it with weapons, or assists the 
Iranian Government in their vast human rights abuses will be subject to 
sanction.
  It is important to note that these sanctions do not violate the JCPOA 
and, in my view, strengthen the nuclear deal by showing our allies and 
Iran that the United States is serious about continuing to enforce 
violations of international law.
  I am also pleased to see additional sanctions imposed upon Russia and 
North Korea in this legislation. The human suffering that North Korea 
has brought upon its own people is unimaginable. Such a depraved leader 
as Kim Jong-un getting his hands on nuclear weapons that can be used 
against American allies is an outcome that we simply cannot tolerate.
  Finally, Russia engaged in an unprecedented attack against our 
democracy when it interfered in our 2016 election. This is the 
fundamental foundation of our democracy, our election, and we simply 
cannot allow any foreign power to interfere in our electoral process.
  Given our President's complete unwillingness to hold Russia 
accountable for their attack--and let's not mistake it for anything 
else; it was an attack on America--it has become necessary for Congress 
to assert its role in this area and ensure that Russia will be held 
accountable.
  So, again, I thank Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, Leader 
Pelosi, Whip Hoyer, and members of

[[Page H6263]]

the Senate who worked together to get this bill to the floor. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and 
International Organizations.
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. I thank him and Eliot Engel for sponsoring this important 
bill.
  This bill brings together a critical arsenal of stiff and timely 
sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea.
  The administration was absolutely right in early February to put Iran 
on notice regarding its continued testing of ballistic missiles. This 
bill underscores that warning by imposing expanded sanctions against 
Iran's missile program, demonstrating that the United States will not 
sit idly by as Iran augments its ability to militarily blackmail the 
United States, Israel, and our allies.
  It also, as the world's largest sponsor of terrorism, imposes terror 
sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It very 
importantly, as well, authorizes the imposition of sanctions on 
individuals responsible for Iran's human rights abuses.
  The State Department suggests there are as many as 800 political 
prisoners in Iran alone. It also reminds us and draws attention to 
Iran's despicable practice of arresting American citizens to use them 
as bargaining chips.
  On Russia, Mr. Speaker, the Putin government's invasion of Ukraine 
and annexation of Crimea; indiscriminate bombing in Syria; and 
threatening behavior toward our NATO allies, above all, in the Baltics 
makes it--important in respects--the worst actor in the global stage 
today. Putin's government has passed from threats to aggressive actions 
against our friends, allies, and innocent people abroad.
  Let's not forget that in 2008--and I was there in Tbilisi as it was 
happening--the Russians invaded Georgia and annexed South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia.
  As to North Korea, a gulag masquerading as a country, we must cut off 
all economic lifelines to Kim Jong-un, and punish Pyongyang's clients 
and its enablers. A regime that murdered Otto Warmbier and then, of 
course, is working on more missiles and the means to deliver them needs 
to be taken seriously. This legislation does that with very stiff 
sanctions.
  I thank, again, Chairman Royce, Eliot Engel, Majority Leader 
McCarthy, and Steny Hoyer as the principal sponsors of the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3364, the Countering 
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, introduced by my good 
friend, Chairman Ed Royce. I'm proud to be a co-sponsor. This bill 
brings together a critical arsenal of stiff and timely sanctions 
trained at some of the gravest national security threats our country 
faces today.
  The Trump Administration was absolutely right in early February to 
put Iran ``on notice'' regarding its continued testing of ballistic 
missiles. This bill underscores that warning by imposing expanded 
sanctions against Iran's missile program--demonstrating that the United 
States will not sit idly by as Iran augments its ability to blackmail 
Israel and other allies.
  The stakes could hardly be higher. Iran possesses the largest 
ballistic missile program in the region and its medium-range ballistic 
missiles are already able to strike Israel and our allies and 
installations in the Gulf from deep within Iranian territory. Iran's 
growing space launch program--a thinly veiled testing scheme for 
intercontinental ballistic missiles--is cause for greater alarm still.
  Iran is also the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism. By 
requiring the imposition of terror sanctions on the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps, H.R. 3364 treats the IRGC as what it truly 
is: Iran's principal means of exporting terrorism around the world, 
particularly to Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Bahrain.
  The U.S. cannot tolerate this brinksmanship and blackmail. Iran 
dreams of nothing less than regional hegemony and Israel's 
annihilation. There is no room for compromise with such an adversary. 
Now is the time to act: Iran is entrenching its influence in Syria and 
Iraq and insuring these gains with the credibility of its missile 
threat and militant proxies. We must pass this bill to bring maximum 
pressure to bear against a mounting threat.
  Importantly, this bill also authorizes the imposition of sanctions on 
individuals responsible for Iran's horrifying human rights abuses. In 
May, the State Department reported to Congress that: ``The Iranian 
regime's repression of its own people includes reports of over 800 
political prisoners, composed of peaceful civic activists, journalists, 
women's rights activists, religious and ethnic minorities, and 
opposition political figures.''
  This bill would also draw increased attention to Iran's despicable 
practice of arresting American citizens to use them as bargaining 
chips. On Friday, the Trump Administration rightfully called Iran out 
for using these detentions as ``a tool of state policy'' and threatened 
``new and serious'' consequences if this practice continues. We must 
not forget the lives and families of Robert Levinson, Siamak and Baquer 
Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and others that have been torn apart by Iran's 
cynical schemes.
  Mr. Speaker, regarding Russia, the Putin government's invasion of 
Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, indiscriminate bombing in Syria, and 
threatening behavior toward our NATO allies, above all in the Baltics, 
makes it among the worst actors on the global stage today. Putin's 
government has passed from threats to aggressive action against our 
friends, allies and innocent civilians abroad. And it did so long ago, 
when it invaded Georgia in 2008.
  I was there, in Tbilisi, several weeks after that invasion began, to 
work to secure the exit of two young children, constituents of mine, 
trapped behind Russian lines in South Ossetia. I will never forget the 
quiet courage of the Georgian people in Tbilisi--not entirely surprised 
by Putin's invasion--they were too wise for that--uncertain whether the 
Russian army would proceed to Tbilisi, and determined to soldier on in 
defense of their country.
  And then in 2014 the Russian government annexed Crimea and invaded 
eastern Ukraine--each of these incursions was marked by massive human 
rights violations, violence toward anyone suspected of being 
unsympathetic to the Russian imperialist cause, and created massive 
humanitarian crises of displaced persons, which the Russian government 
did nothing to relieve.
  These acts of aggression underscore the seriousness with which we 
must take the Russian government's testing of our limits and our will, 
by buzzing our ships and planes, harassing our diplomats, and 
intimidating our allies--as it does for example with the Zapad 
exercises set to take place in September near the Polish, Lithuanian, 
Latvian, and Estonian borders.
  We know from experience that the best way to maintain the peace and 
keep our country secure is to respond strongly to Russian expansionism 
and intimidation attempts--this sanctions bill does just that.
  The large number of political assassinations that have scarred 
Russian public life since Putin arrived on the scene--the most 
notorious but not the only attack on the rights of Russian citizens for 
which the Putin government is responsible. These brutal crimes only 
underscore the need to respond strongly to Putin's attempts to 
intimidate us and our allies.
  Congress has responded strongly to Putin's aggressions and crimes 
before, for example with the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and 
Accountability Act and the Global Magnitsky legislation, of which I was 
the House chief sponsor, taking the lessons of the earlier act and 
applied them globally, while in its name further memorializing the 
heroic sacrifice of Sergei Magnitsky. The Magnitsky legislation was so 
strongly detested by the Putin government that in early 2013, having 
cosponsored the original Magnitsky legislation, the Russian government 
refused to issue me a visa to visit Russia to work on international 
child adoption issues. A State Department official commented to me at 
the time that as far he knew, I was the first Congressman denied a visa 
since the Brezhnev era.
  So, in addition to enacting this new legislation, I want to join 
Vladimir Kara-Murza's call that the Magnitsky legislation continue to 
be implemented energetically and fully. Kara-Murza is a Russian 
democracy activist who twice was nearly killed by sophisticated poisons 
while visiting Russia--he testified for me at the Helsinki Commission 
after the first poisoning attempt, in October 2015. Many of the Putin 
government's murders are motivated by economic crimes and 
implementation of the Magnitsky legislation should also include U.S. 
government advocacy on behalf of U.S. investors defrauded by Russian 
expropriations--the Yukos oil company is the most notorious case of 
this.
  As to North Korea--a gulag masquerading as a country--we must cut off 
all economic lifelines to Kim Jong un and punish Pyongyang's clients 
and its enablers. A regime that murders Otto Warmbier does not deserve 
respect and should be considered an imminent threat to the US and its 
allies because of its nuclear proliferation.
  We cannot negotiate our way out of these strategic problems. Carrots 
have not worked, we need bigger sticks.
  We know sanctions are working. Thae Yong Ho (Thay Young Ho)--North 
Korea's former

[[Page H6264]]

deputy ambassador to Britain and the highest ranking defector in twenty 
years--said that international sanctions are beginning to squeeze the 
regime. He also said that the spread of information from the outside 
world is having a real impact. So it shouldn't be a surprise that South 
Korea has reported that high-level defections are surging.
  This legislation provides crucial tools and I support them 
wholeheartedly--as I supported them in May of this year.
  The Trump Administration will find that it can use the tools we offer 
today to much greater use than did the last White House. With hundreds 
of thousands of North Korean laborers abroad--sending as much as $2 
billion a year back to the regime in hard currency--we should look at 
targeting this expatriate labor and the governments and corporations 
that employ them.
  Loopholes in our sanctions on North Korea's shipping and financial 
sectors must be closed. And when we discover that foreign banks have 
helped Kim Jong un skirt sanctions--as those in China have repeatedly 
done--we must give those banks and businesses a stark choice: do 
business with Kim Jong un or the U.S.
  Cut off Kim Jong un's economic lifelines, punish those who keep his 
murderous regime afloat, and signal to China and its client state in 
North Korea that the era of ``strategic patience'' is finally over.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly support this critical 
measure at a perilous moment for our country and the rest of the 
planet.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Castro), our colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee and a 
member of the Intelligence Committee.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Engel for 
yielding.
  I also thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on the sanctions 
package. The American people have been waiting some time for the 
sanctions package to finally pass.
  This bill dials up our current sanctions on North Korea, Iran, and 
Russia to hold their governments accountable for their destabilizing 
actions.
  The Russia piece in this package is particularly necessary. Russia 
has flagrantly violated international law by invading Ukraine and 
interfering in American and European elections. These sanctions are a 
clear signal that the United States will hold President Putin and his 
close associates accountable for their actions. They are also a 
declaration that Congress can and will act, even when President Trump 
refuses to do so.
  In addition to these sanctions, Congress must continue to investigate 
to determine the scope of Russia's attack on America's democracy and 
establish which Americans, if any, aided in those efforts.
  Again, I thank Ranking Member Engel, Chairman Royce, and everyone in 
this Congress who has supported these sanctions.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), chairman of the Committee on 
Financial Services.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and 
certainly for his leadership on this very important bill.
  I rise in support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korean Sanctions 
Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to highlight the provisions that are 
the product of the hard work of the Financial Services Committee's 
Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. The inclusion of these 
provisions will undoubtedly assist our government's anti-money 
laundering and counterterrorist financing efforts.
  For instance, this bill includes language directing the President, 
acting through the Secretary of the Treasury, to develop and maintain a 
national strategy for combating the financing of terrorism and related 
forms of illicit financing.
  The opportunistic nature of terrorist groups, combined with the 
emergence of financial technology, creates new challenges for our law 
enforcement community and their efforts to disrupt terror finance.
  The national strategy should also seek to enhance partnerships with 
the private sector that prevent and detect illicit financing, and 
increase efforts to facilitate compliance with our anti-money 
laundering and counterterrorist financing laws.
  I would like to commend Congressman Ted Budd for introducing the 
National Strategy for Combating Terrorists, Underground, and Other 
Illicit Financing Act, which is almost entirely incorporated in section 
2 of the underlying legislation.
  I would also like to recognize Congressman Pearce and Congressman 
Pittenger, the chairman and vice chairman of the Terrorism and Illicit 
Finance Subcommittee of our committee, whose leadership on these issues 
has been instrumental to achieve the legislation that is before us 
today.
  Mr. Speaker, we know that Thomas Jefferson once famously said: ``The 
price of liberty is eternal vigilance.'' And that is indeed true.
  Thanks, in no small part, to the hard work of the Subcommittee on 
Terrorism and Illicit Finance, the bill before us today ensures that we 
remain vigilant to address the evolving threats to our financial 
system. I am proud to support it and I encourage all Members to support 
it.
  Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership today on this bill 
and in our committee.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who was instrumental in putting this bill 
forward, who has been with us every step of the way and so invaluable 
to this finished product, the distinguished Democratic whip.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Engel for yielding. 
And I thank Mr. Royce for his hard work on this bill.
  I have said this before and I will say it again: Mr. Royce, as 
chairman, and Mr. Engel, as ranking member, are an example for, 
frankly, all of us on how to work together productively in a bipartisan 
fashion to reach a result that is good for our country, for our people, 
and indeed for international security.
  I also want to thank Senators Cardin and Corker for their leadership 
and their involvement.
  This legislation is the product of very careful and sometimes 
difficult negotiations on a bipartisan basis. It is a strong, tough, 
and appropriate response to Russia's attempts to meddle in our election 
process, its support for violent separatists in Ukraine, its illegal 
occupation of Crimea, and, yes, its unhelpful activity in Syria.
  It also imposes new sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program, 
which threatens the United States, our Gulf allies, and Israel.
  Russia's power comes from its ability to coerce other nations by its 
energy distribution, in many instances. This bill seeks to make it 
harder for Russia to use that type of coercion, and empower other 
nations to join us in standing up against Russian aggression. These 
sanctions will only be successful, however, if they are truly 
bipartisan and if Congress continues to play its important and 
necessary oversight role.
  Democrats and Republicans are coming together on this bill, Mr. 
Speaker, to ensure that the President cannot alter sanctions toward 
Russia without congressional review. This is critical at a moment when 
our allies are uncertain about where this administration stands with 
respect to Russian aggression.
  I remain open to additional sanctions on Russia's energy sector at a 
later date if the Russian leader and his associates fail to heed the 
message of this bill that their business as usual cannot and must not 
continue.

  Once this bill passes the Senate, as I believe it will, Russia will 
know that sanctions levied because of its malevolent acts will be 
lifted only with the concurrence, either tacitly or expressly, of the 
Congress of the United States. There will be no side deals or turning a 
blind eye to its actions.
  This legislation, Mr. Speaker, will also make it clear that Russia's 
interference in Ukraine comes with consequences, and it puts pressure 
on Iran to end its ballistic missile program.
  In addition, it deters, hopefully, North Korea from pursuing its 
dangerous development of nuclear weapons and vehicles to deliver those 
weapons as close as the western part of this country.
  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to send it to 
the Senate as quickly as possible.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to recognize the good 
work of the Democratic whip, Mr. Steny

[[Page H6265]]

Hoyer, and also the Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, on this 
legislation and to thank them.
  Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. ROYCE of California. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
  Mr. HOYER. Frankly, all four of us--yourself and your leadership, Mr. 
Engel, the majority leader, and I--were privileged to work together in 
a way that, as I said at the beginning, was constructive and that, I 
think, has resulted in a very good product.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the chairman of the 
Rules Committee, for the purpose of a colloquy.

                              {time}  1500

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for yielding 
me this time, and I rise to applaud him for the hard work and the 
responsible actions that the chairman has taken, not only to ensure 
this piece of legislation is prepared, but bettered and ready to go 
back to the Senate.
  I think we have a forceful sanctions bill that is before the House 
today, and one that targets not only Iran and Russia, but also the 
North Korean regime.
  As you know, the bill that was passed by the Senate risked giving 
Russian energy firms a competitive advantage across the globe by 
inadvertently denying American companies access to neutral third-party 
energy markets where there would simply be a small or de minimis 
Russian presence.
  The bill before us today prevents Russia from being able to weaponize 
these sanctions against U.S. energy firms. I want to thank Chairman 
Royce for his hard work on this issue.
  I also want to ensure that we have an understanding of the definition 
of the word ``controlling'' in section 223(d) of H.R. 3364. For 
purposes of clarification and legislative intent, the term 
``controlling'' means the power to direct, determine, or resolve 
fundamental, operational, and financial decisions of an oil project 
through the ownership of a majority of the voting interests of the oil 
project.
  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman, the young chairman, if he 
agrees with that definition.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentleman from California.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Yes. Yes, that is my understanding.
  Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman for not only this 
clarification, but making sure that we are most specific in what we are 
undertaking.
  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that the Shah Deniz Pipeline 
and the Southern Gas Corridor projects will continue to be able to 
bring gas from the Caspian Sea, which is a huge find, to our European 
allies, reducing their dependency on Russian energy.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. That is my understanding.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, and I would 
thank him for his time on this colloquy.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Sherman), one of my senior colleagues on the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, the ranking member of the Terrorism, 
Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee.
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to 
me.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, which is really a 
combination of three bills. First, as to North Korea, it embodies a 
bill passed on this floor in May introduced by Chairman Royce, Ranking 
Member Engel, Mr. Yoho, and myself from the Asia and the Pacific 
Subcommittee. We will expand our sanctions on North Korea's precious 
metals, minerals, jet fuel, coal, and across the board, and especially 
banking sanctions.
  But keep in mind, ultimately, we have got to force China to decide 
whether they are going to support North Korea or whether they are going 
to have access to American markets. We can't let them have both.
  As to Iran, this bill designates the entire Iran Revolutionary Guard 
Corps, as the Quds Force has already been designated, as subject to 
terrorism sanctions, and provides an arms embargo. Let us remember that 
the real face of this regime in Tehran is not their dapper foreign 
minister, but rather it is the hundreds of thousands who have died in 
Syria as a result of Iranian action.
  Speaking of countries that have supported Assad, finally and perhaps 
most importantly, this bill provides sanctions against Russia necessary 
because of its action in the Ukraine and its interference in our 
elections.
  We hit Russia in a very important way by dealing with the technology 
they would need to explore oil. Unfortunately, even under this very 
strong bill, it would take a two-thirds vote for us to block a 
sanctions waiver should our resolution be vetoed.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs' 
Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I also thank 
the ranking member for their work on this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken to our military leaders, and they said 
that the biggest threat to the United States is North Korea. Strategic 
patience is over. It is time for strategic sanctions. This bill will go 
a long way to tighten the screws on little Kim and bring the dictator 
to his knees. We can no longer stand by meekly while North Korea 
terrorizes the world.
  This bill includes my bill that has already passed the House that 
calls on the State Department to reassess if North Korea should be on 
the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Let us not forget that North 
Korea helped supply Syria with chemical weapons. It has given Iran 
ballistic missiles and advice on how to develop its own nukes.
  North Korea and Iran's evil cooperation is even going on as we speak 
today. They are now working together to develop an intercontinental 
ballistic missile that can reach American shores.
  This bill also puts China in the crosshairs. Chinese banks have 
enabled the Korean regime to avoid sanctions and build its illegal 
weapons programs. China even provided the vehicle used to launch North 
Korea's new ICBM.
  China also uses slave labor from North Korea to help North Korea 
avoid sanctions already in place. China needs to understand how its 
support for Kim will not only endanger the United States and South 
Korea, but it also endangers its own security.
  Mr. Speaker, by targeting these rogue nations, we show we will not go 
away quietly in the darkness of silence.
  And that is just the way it is.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Connolly), one of our senior members on the Foreign 
Affairs Committee.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the distinguished 
ranking member, Mr. Engel.
  Mr. Speaker, today, this House comes together on a bipartisan basis 
to address sanctions and the rules on the girding sanctions for North 
Korea, Iran, and, most importantly perhaps, Russia. Importantly, 
because there has been a lot of doubt about whether this Congress would 
ever again speak eloquently and forcefully about Russian behavior.
  Today, we answer that question. Overwhelmingly, we say Russia's 
behavior is unacceptable in many ways, not least of which is the 
incursion of sovereign territory of its neighbors, specifically 
Georgia, Ukraine, including Crimea.
  I vote easily and enthusiastically for the resolution today, but it 
must not be construed, because it references the Minsk agreement, that 
that means that we don't mean to continue sanctions on the Crimean 
invasion. We do.
  Mr. Chabot and I, and I know the chairman and the ranking member of 
our committee, will continue to be vigilant on that until that illegal 
annexation is ended.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend the leadership for bringing this resolution to 
the floor, and I am proud today to be a Member of this body and 
speaking with one voice about Russian behavior and the need for 
sanctioning it.
  Mr. Speaker, this Congress does not trust the President of the United 
States to manage U.S.-Russia relations.
  Case in point--the first major legislative accomplishment of the 
Republican-led Congress in the Trump era will be a sanctions package

[[Page H6266]]

that limits, in every imaginable way, the president's ability to 
appease Putin.
  President Trump and his administration have given the American public 
little reason to trust them on all things Russia.
  The President obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey, 
the law enforcement officer tasked with investigating illegal collusion 
between the Trump campaign and Russia.
  Attorney General Jeff Sessions potentially perjured himself by 
failing to disclose secret meetings with the Russian Ambassador.
  Donald Trump, Jr. obscured a meeting he had with the Trump campaign's 
chairman, the president's son-in-law, and Russian operatives until the 
New York Times forced his hand and he had to publish emails that 
confirmed his collusion with individuals associated with Russian 
intelligence operations.
  And now the president is attempting to intimidate his own Attorney 
General into prosecuting political opponents and upending the Russia 
investigation.
  Today, we will pass this sanctions package, the strongest ever, and 
send a clear message to President Putin that there are consequences to 
invading peaceful neighbors and attacking American democratic 
institutions.
  I reserve an important objection to the fact that this bill allows a 
waiver of Crimea-related sanctions on the condition that the Minsk 
agreement is being implemented.
  Minsk does not mention Crimea, and therefore its implementation 
should have no bearing on the U.S.-led effort to combat the illegal and 
forcible annexation of Crimea sovereign Ukrainian territory.
  However, I will vote for this bill because it sends a powerful and 
unified message to Russia, Iran, and North Korea at time when the 
foreign policy emanating from the White House is unsteady and confused.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce.
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this 
sanctions bill. The governments of Iran, North Korea, and Russia do not 
share American values or interests and are active threats to our 
national security. These regimes will see a united message from the 
Congress of the United States with an overwhelming vote in favor of 
strong sanctions.
  Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea, 
the most dangerous and isolated place on Earth, has tested long-range 
missiles demonstrating a frightening potential to target our West 
Coast. Russia has intolerably involved itself in our Nation's 
democratic electoral process. Its invasion of Crimea and actions in 
Ukraine are totally unacceptable.
  Mr. Speaker, let us act decisively today and put these states on 
notice: violate international law by threatening the United States and 
thereby face the consequences.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of the Financial 
Services Committee.
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
Engel for his leadership and for yielding me time. I thank Chairman 
Royce for his leadership and the way that he has worked with our side 
of the aisle.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korea 
Sanctions Act, legislation that is desperately needed to prevent this 
administration from rolling back sanctions tied to Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine and interference in our election.
  This bill's enhanced sanctions on Russia are important in light of 
the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, not to mention the 
many ties between the Trump administration and the Kremlin.
  In a recent development, the Treasury Department confirmed that 
ExxonMobil violated existing Russian sanctions while under the 
leadership of Rex Tillerson, who is now Donald Trump's Secretary of 
State. Indeed, in 2014, Exxon signed documents related to oil and gas 
projects in Russia with Igor Sechin, president of Rosneft, a Russian 
state-owned oil giant. Sechin was one of the individuals subject to 
sanctions. Exxon was fined a mere $2 million--a slap on the wrist for a 
company that earned $7.8 billion in profits in 2016.
  Russia is continuing its aggression in Ukraine. It is supporting the 
murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. It interfered in the 2016 
U.S. election. That is why we must strengthen the sanctions against 
Russia, and we must block Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump from waiving 
or lifting those sanctions without review.
  Before closing, I would also note that the legislation before us also 
includes several measures championed by Democrats on the Financial 
Services Committee. These provisions will focus the government on 
creating a national strategy to combat the financing of terrorism, 
enhance Treasury's tools for combating money laundering vulnerabilities 
such as the well-known risk in high-end real estate, and help address 
the de-risking trend that is driving fund transfers into the shadows.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), a member of the Committee on 
Financial Services.
  Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3364. 
In particular, I am proud of the bipartisan language in the bill which 
would create a national strategy for combating terrorism and illicit 
finance. The financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit 
finance present a direct threat to our national security and financial 
system.
  It is critical for the government to create and maintain a unified 
strategy to fight financial crime, both to accommodate new and 
developing threats and to help Congress develop legislative and funding 
priorities now and in the future.
  Additionally, a national strategy should seek to enhance 
intergovernmental cooperation, to identify illicit financing trends, 
and to encourage Federal agencies to work with the private financial 
sector to do the same.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill does these things and will go a long way in 
making sure we are keeping pace with the ever-changing terror finance 
landscape.
  I would like to thank Chairman Hensarling for his extraordinary 
conservative leadership on the Financial Services Committee and for 
helping to include this language in the overall bill.
  Additionally, I want to thank the chairman of the Terrorism and 
Illicit Finance Subcommittee, Mr. Pearce, and for his support, and for 
my colleague, Ms. Sinema, for her work on this as well.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Arizona (Ms. Sinema), my friend on the Financial Services Committee.
  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3364. The 
authoritarian regimes in Iran, Russia, and North Korea continue to 
undermine global peace and security and threaten the safety of the 
United States and our allies.
  Russia's coordinated efforts to undermine democracies and free and 
fair elections around the world is particularly troubling and demand a 
strong response.
  I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their bipartisan 
legislation that counters these belligerent regimes and ensures strong 
oversight by Congress and the American people.
  The safety and security of our communities and our country must come 
before partisanship.
  I also thank the chair and ranking member for introducing our 
bipartisan legislation introduced with Congressman Budd to establish a 
whole-of-government strategy to combat the financing of terrorism.
  Current U.S. efforts to counter the financing of terrorism lack 
sufficient coordination, and the U.S. has no unified national strategy 
to guide our counterfinancing efforts. Money is the lifeblood of any 
organization. We must establish a comprehensive and effective strategy 
to deny money to terrorists. This strategy will enhance detection, 
deterrence, and prosecution and ultimately strengthen our broader 
national security goals.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking member for advancing this 
important bipartisan national security bill, and I urge my colleagues 
to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.

                              {time}  1515

  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. Ryan), my friend on the Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the

[[Page H6267]]

ranking member for their leadership on this.
  This clearly is a big issue pressing the country, and I just wanted 
to rise in support of what is happening here today; of taking a firmer 
stance on Russia, Iran, and North Korea; trying to stabilize the 
peninsula; trying to take care of the funding that is coming out of 
Iran to all of these terrorist groups across the country and across the 
world.
  What is happening with these sanctions here in the targeting of 
Russian gas pipelines--their number one export--I think is entirely 
appropriate. The Nord Stream 2, which carries gas from Russia through 
the Baltics to Germany--and I know Germany isn't happy about it, but 
this is something that we have to do.
  The point I want to make is that we have to address this issue in a 
comprehensive way. We must continue to focus on how we get our gas here 
in the United States, our natural gas to Europe, to our allies, so they 
are not so dependent on Russia. We have got to have the sanctions, but 
we also have got to be shipping liquid natural gas to some of these 
allies of ours so they are not so dependent on the Russians, which is 
part and parcel of this entire approach.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a respected member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  I rise in support of today's sanction legislation, which I am so 
happy to find has complied with the Iran nuclear agreement, something I 
worked very hard on, as did many here.
  Experts, the international community, and even some of President 
Trump's own advisers agree that the Iran nuclear agreement is working. 
In June, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran is 
within the limits set by this historic deal. There are serious issues 
left to be addressed with Iran, especially in regards to human rights 
violations and ballistic missiles, which this bill covers.
  The Iran deal took Iran's nuclear weapons off the table and allowed 
us to deal with these remaining challenges. Withdrawing or violating 
the agreement would be an enormous mistake. This bill upholds our 
agreement with Iran while also holding Russia and North Korea 
accountable for their actions.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. Price).
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to stress two 
critical aspects of this legislation.
  First, it would impose tough sanctions on Russia for its serious 
international violations, the seizure of Crimea, its violent incursion 
into Ukraine, its cyber interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Perhaps 
most importantly, in the present context, it would prevent President 
Trump from removing or softening existing sanctions without 
congressional approval.
  Second, the bill addresses Iran's unacceptable behavior in the non-
nuclear realm, such as ballistic missile development, human rights 
violations, financing of terrorism, without violating the nuclear deal 
with Iran.
  The JCPOA celebrated its second anniversary 2 weeks ago. It has given 
the international community 24/7 access to Iran's nuclear sites, 
provided an enforcement mechanism to ensure that Iran's nuclear-related 
activity is solely peaceful, and elongated Iran's breakout time to over 
a year. It has made the world a safer place.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from North Carolina.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the United States 
continues to monitor the JCPOA and Iran's behavior, it is important 
that Congress continue to refrain from actions that would violate the 
deal, threaten the deal, or impose careless sanctions that--under the 
guise of being tough on Iran--would make the United States less safe.
  This legislation meets that test, and I urge its adoption.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  On Vladimir Putin's orders, Russia attacked American democracy last 
year. That makes Russia a threat to this country, just like Iran, just 
like North Korea.
  When the United States faces a real threat, we have an obligation to 
respond. So far, a response to Russia has fallen far short. That ends 
with this legislation.
  Along with Pyongyang and Tehran, Moscow needs to understand that if 
you violate international law, you threaten the security of the United 
States and our allies, there will be consequences.
  Now, I wish we were going to pass this incentive to the President's 
desk today. So after we vote today, leaders in both houses have an 
obligation to clear away any remaining issues and get this bill signed 
into law as soon as possible.
  So long as Russia remains a threat, so long as Iran and North Korea 
defy global norms with their destructive agendas, none of us are off 
the hook.
  I want to also thank the Democratic leader, Ms. Pelosi, for her 
advice and counsel on this bill. Let's pass this bill and keep pressing 
this bill forward.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to again thank my colleagues; 
the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel; our 
counterparts, Senators Corker and Cardin; the majority leader, Mr. 
McCarthy; the minority whip, Mr. Hoyer; as well as the leadership on 
both sides of the aisle in the other body. They deserve credit for 
their efforts.
  Let me also say it is critically important that we stand shoulder to 
shoulder with our European allies encountering Russian aggression. That 
is why, in the bipartisan House-Senate negotiations, we secured 
important changes to improve transatlantic cooperation. So I am 
confident that, under the text of this House bill that we will pass 
today, these concerns have been addressed.
  Let me also say that every time North Korea tests a ballistic missile 
or a nuclear device, it gets closer to having the ability to strike the 
U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon.
  For years, the policies of successive administrations have failed to 
get North Korea to change.
  Why?
  Because diplomatic pressure has been applied only in spurts. It has 
been lifted prematurely for North Korean promises that have never 
materialized.
  So we need leverage, and leverage comes from real sustained pressure. 
That is why I have authored tough new sanctions to crack down on the 
regime, to shut off the regime's access to the hard currency it needs 
to fund its nuclear program, and we have included that in this bill.
  These sanctions passed in this House in May by a vote of 419-1, and 
it is time for the other body to pick them up. By including these North 
Korean sanctions in the legislation, we ensure that our colleagues do 
so.
  We cannot afford any more delay, and that is why I worked with the 
other body to make small changes to the North Korean sanctions in this 
bill, to ensure swift passage in both Houses. I am confident this bill, 
including the North Korean sanctions bill, will soon become law.
  Let me say that congressional engagement in foreign affairs is 
strongest when we all speak with one voice. I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of the bill and join us in sending a clear message to 
Vladimir Putin, to Kim Jong-un, and to the radical regime in Tehran 
that efforts to threaten the United States and to destabilize our 
allies will be met with a united American response.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3364 or 
the bill entitled ``Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act.''
  As a senior member of the Committee on Homeland Security and its 
Subcommittees on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, and Cybersecurity, 
Infrastructure Protection, and Security

[[Page H6268]]

Technologies, I am reminded daily that there are actors and nation-
states that threaten the security of our nation.
  Within the past year, the United States has experienced a series of 
aggressions that threaten not only our nation's security, but also the 
very democratic principles that are the foundation upon which our 
country was built.
  These hostile acts have been orchestrated and perpetrated by our 
long-time adversaries--Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
  Within that short time span, their actions have been so egregious 
that it is inexcusable that this administration has failed to respond 
to these acts of aggression with strength and resolve.
  Mr. Speaker, U.S. intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russian 
hackers launched cyberattacks during one of the most sacred processes 
in our republic--the U.S. presidential election.
  Specifically, we know that Russia was behind the cyber theft of DNC 
documents and that Russian hackers intentionally targeted 21 U.S. state 
election systems during the 2016 presidential campaign.
  This administration refused to acknowledge Russia's tampering in last 
year's election until it became impossible to deny what everyone knows 
to be true.
  Further, Iran's support of groups who actively operate against U.S. 
interests is disturbing even in the face of the implementation of the 
JCPOA in January 2016.
  North Korea is growing increasingly belligerent, launching 17 
missiles since the beginning of this year as it attempts to improve its 
missile capabilities with each launch.
  Although North Korea has launched missiles in the past, never have 
they occurred in such a rapid, unpredictable succession.
  In a show of bipartisanship, our counterparts in the Senate led the 
charge in adopting legislation that would stop Russia, Iran, and North 
Korea from operating with such impunity.
  On June 15, 2017, the Senate passed an amended version of S. 722, the 
``Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017'' that not 
only penalizes Iran but also punishes Russia for its interference in 
the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
  The fact that that legislation was passed 98-2 demonstrated 
congressional willingness to set clear boundaries for what is and is 
not acceptable behavior especially for our adversaries.
  The House must act just as decisively by passing H.R. 3364.
   H.R. 3364 will work to avert and penalize any threat posed by 
adversaries in several ways.
  One of the most important provisions of this act is that it will 
prevent the Trump Administration from repealing existing Obama-era 
Russian sanctions tied to Ukraine and election interference.
  H.R. 3364 will also impose new sanctions on Russia while 
strengthening other sanctions.
  Furthermore, it will require congressional oversight for altering 
sanctions related to Russia.
  With respect to Iran, H.R. 3364 will mandate new sanctions on those 
who support the development of Iran's ballistic missile program.
  H.R. 3364 requires the imposition of sanctions on Iran for human 
rights violations as well as sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps.
  Finally, H.R. 3364 clamps down on North Korea by updating and 
expanding sanctions in direct response to its repeated aggression.
  In addition, H.R. 3364 also makes it more difficult for North Korea 
to secure the funding for its illegal weapon program.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time that this body acts to show that the United 
States will not tolerate and will respond to threats to our homeland, 
our national security.
  That is why I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 3364.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I voted for H.R. 3364, the 
Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Roll no. 413). 
This legislation is an important step forward in punishing Russia for 
its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and for the country's alleged 
interference in the 2016 United States presidential election.
  The bill also updates and expands sanctions on North Korea at a time 
when the country continues to pursue dangerous weapons programs.
  Further, I commend leadership and committee members in the House and 
Senate for ensuring that the Iran sanctions portion of this legislation 
does not violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached 
between Iran, the United States, and five major world powers, including 
Russia and China. While the Iranian ballistic missile program is deeply 
concerning and must be addressed, undermining the nuclear agreement, 
which has forced Iran to remove thousands of centrifuges from service 
and halt all uranium enrichment, would be a mistake of tragic 
proportions.
  The bipartisan support for the bill should be a signal to the 
administration to refrain from taking action that would encourage Iran 
to change course.
  To be sure, Iran has some unsavory hardline people in key positions 
of leadership, but these hardliners just suffered a major defeat in the 
Iranian elections. President Hassan Rouhani has been a voice of and a 
force for moderation--and people voted for him.
  We must proceed with the utmost caution and develop a thoughtful 
approach to ensure we continue to keep Iran away from the nuclear 
threshold, while also countering the regime's nefarious activities.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3364--but with 
reservations.
  I strongly support the section of this bill that provides a role for 
the Congress before any president may waive sanctions or provide relief 
from sanctions against Russia. Russia sought to undermine America's 
2016 election. It attempted to subvert our democracy. It did so 
deliberately, methodically, and ruthlessly, spreading lies and 
misinformation and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems and 
records to steal private information and release it in sensationalistic 
fashion.
  These attacks against our democracy were and are totally unacceptable 
and must be condemned. I remain bewildered that the current president 
of the United States still fails to acknowledge that these actions 
happened and that the Russian government, at the very highest level, is 
responsible--even though there is a consensus among all U.S. domestic 
and international intelligence and law enforcement agencies that this 
is the case.
  Sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration in response to this 
multifaceted operation were lifted by President Trump. This legislation 
rectifies that situation by re-imposing those sanctions and ensuring 
that they cannot be removed without congressional consultation and 
consent.
  In addition, Russia continues to threaten its neighbors, especially 
Ukraine, for which economic and military sanctions are now in place.
  But I am somewhat reluctant in my support for this legislation 
because of the provisions included on Iran. Like all my colleagues, I 
am worried about Iran's continued testing and development of ballistic 
missile technology. It is threatening and provocative to Iran's 
neighbors and the region. I also oppose Iran's support for regional 
militant and terrorist organizations, and for choosing to side with the 
brutal regime of Bashir al-Assad in the Syrian conflict, as did Russia.
  I do support, however, Iran's continuing compliance with the terms of 
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)--or the Iran nuclear 
deal. I worry that the sanctions against Iran included in this bill 
will be used and manipulated to undermine the JCPOA. I am worried that 
we now have a president and an Administration actively seeking to 
abrogate this international nuclear agreement. And I strongly oppose 
any action that would violate, let alone abandon, the JCPOA.
  The Trump Administration--and the White House in particular--seem 
hell-bent on putting us on a path that leads to yet another costly war 
in the Middle East and to a nuclear-armed Iran. This would be a 
calamity of the greatest order, one that would place our friends and 
allies in the region in even greater danger than what they now face. We 
must not go there.
  While I will vote in favor of H.R. 3364, I do so with grave 
misgivings about how President Trump will seek to exploit the sanctions 
against Iran provided in this bill to violate U.S. obligations under 
the JCPOA, which will, in turn, give permission to Iran to develop a 
nuclear weapon, and bring us all to the brink of war in the Middle 
East.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 3364.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

                          ____________________
