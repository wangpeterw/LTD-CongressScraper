                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for February 2018. The report compares current-law 
levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to 
in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018, H. Con. Res. 71. This 
information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine 
whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The 
Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional 
Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of 
the Congressional Budget Act, CBA.
  The enforceable levels included in this report reflect all of the 
numerical adjustments made to the resolution since its passage. The 
information contained in this report captures legislative activity from 
the passage of the budget resolution through February 26, 2018.
  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1-4 of this report.
  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee 
exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays 
under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is 
used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the 
CBA. For this reporting period, 11 of the 16 authorizing committees are 
in compliance with their allocations. As previously reported, the 
Senate Veterans' Affairs, Energy and Natural Resources, and Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees remain in breach of their 
allocations. Since my last report on January 18, 2018, both the Finance 
and Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committees have increased 
spending beyond allowable levels. Through the enactment of both the 
fourth continuing resolution, H.R. 195, P.L. 115-120, and the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18, H.R. 1892, P.L. 115-123, which 
contained packages of healthcare extenders, the Finance Committee 
breached its allocation by $76.9 billion in budget authority and $7.8 
billion in outlays over 10 years. Enactment of the BBA18 also produced 
the Agriculture Committee breach. That law changed the treatment of 
seed cotton, dairy, and livestock under Federal farm programs, 
increasing both budget authority and outlays by $1.2 billion over the 
2018-2027 period.
  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on 
Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This 
information is used to determine points of order related to the 
spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. While no 
full-year appropriations bills have been enacted for fiscal year 2018, 
subcommittees are charged with permanent and advanced appropriations 
that first become available in that year and any full-year standalone 
provisions included in continuing resolutions. This table reflects one 
change from my January report. The continuing resolution portion of the 
BBA18 included full-year authority for the Secretary of Energy to draw 
down and sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, reducing budget 
authority and outlays by $315 million in 2018.
  The budget resolution contains two points of order limiting the use 
of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS. 
Tables 3 and 4 show compliance with fiscal year 2018 limits for overall 
CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This information 
is used for determining points of order under sections 4102 and 4103 of 
H. Con. Res. 71, respectively. Notably, there have not been any full-
year bills enacted thus far for fiscal year 2018 that include CHIMPS.
  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican 
staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget 
totals approved by the Congress.
  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2018, 
which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions 
under CBA section 311. In its report, CBO annualizes the temporary 
effects of the latest continuing resolution, which provides funding 
through March 23, 2018. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, 
the Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the 
committee views current-law levels as being $814.6 billion and $463.7 
billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and 
outlays, respectively. Details on fiscal year 2018 levels can be found 
in CBO's second table.
  Current-law revenues continue to be in excess of the levels assumed 
by the budget resolution. On-budget revenue levels currently exceed 
assumed levels by $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2018, $41.9

[[Page S1281]]

billion over the fiscal year 2018-2022 period, and $98.4 billion over 
the fiscal year 2018-2027 period. Since my last filing both the fourth 
continuing resolution and BBA18 contained provisions that reduced 
revenues compared with current law. The fourth continuing resolution 
included $25.4 billion in on-budget revenue loss over 10 years related 
to delays in several health-related taxes. The BBA18 contained an $11.6 
billion revenue loss largely as a consequence of a package of tax 
extenders. This BBA18 figure omits $1.8 billion in revenue increases 
attributable to language related to Federal Reserve Surplus Funds, 
which are required to be omitted under current scorekeeping rules.
  Social Security outlay levels are consistent with the budget 
resolution's figures for all enforceable periods. Social Security 
revenues, however, are $446 million below levels assumed for fiscal 
year 2018, $1.9 billion greater over the next 5 years, and $28.8 
billion greater than assumed over the next 10 years. These revenue 
effects are attributable to the tax provisions from the fourth 
continuing resolution, BBA18, and the tax reconciliation bill enacted 
in December 2017.
  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate 
pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently 
shows deficit reduction of $24 million in fiscal year 2018, $14 million 
over the fiscal year 2017-2022, and $13 million over fiscal year 2017-
2027 periods. For fiscal year 2018, legislation has been enacted that 
would reduce outlays by $24 million. Over the fiscal year 2017-2022 
period, legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates will decrease 
outlays by $13 million and increase revenues by $1 million. Over the 
fiscal year 2017-2027 period, legislation has been enacted that CBO 
estimates will decrease outlays by $11 million and increase revenues by 
$2 million. Notably absent from these amounts are the direct spending 
and revenue effects from the fourth continuing resolution and BBA18. 
This is due to provisions in those measures that mandated the exclusion 
of those budgetary effects both from the Senate and statutory PAYGO 
scorecards. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 4106 of H. 
Con. Res. 71.
  Also included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's 
budget enforcement activity on the floor since Congress adopted the 
budget resolution. No points of order have been raised on the floor 
since my last filing.
  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.
  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in 
the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                                  Congressional Budget Office,

                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2018.
     Hon. Mike Enzi,
     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,
     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of 
     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2018 budget and is 
     current through February 26, 2018. This report is submitted 
     under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the 
     Congressional Budget Act, as amended.
       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues 
     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of 
     H. Con. Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 
     Fiscal Year 2018.
       Since our last letter dated January 18, 2018, the Congress 
     has cleared and the President has signed the following 
     legislation that has significant effects on budget authority, 
     outlays, and revenues in fiscal year 2018:
       An Act making further continuing appropriations for the 
     fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes 
     (Public Law 115-120); and
       Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123).
           Sincerely,
                                                       Keith Hall,
                                                         Director.
       Enclosure.

c The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) contains seven
  divisions: Division A, Subdivision 2 of Division B, and Divisions C-F
  contain authorizing legislation, of which the budgetary effects of
  Subdivision 2 of Division B were designated as being for emergency
  requirements. Subdivisions 1 and 3 of Division B contain
  appropriations legislation: Subdivision 1 provided supplemental
  appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for disaster relief and designated
  those amounts as being for emergency requirements; Subdivision 3
  provided continuing appropriations until March 23, 2018, while Section
  158 provided authority, for the duration of fiscal year 2018, for the
  Secretary of Energy to draw down and sell crude oil from the Strategic
  Petroleum Reserve. Division G of P.L. 115-123 provided for the
  budgetary treatment of Divisions A-F.
d Pursuant to sections 1001-1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-
  255), certain funding provided to the Department of Health and Human
  Services--in particular the Food and Drug Administration and the
  National Institutes of Health--in 2017 through 2026 shall not count
  for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
  Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) or the Congressional Budget and
  Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Congressional Budget Act) The amounts
  shown m this report do not include $866 million in budget authority
  and $706 million in estimated outlays from such amounts.
e For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act
  in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not
  include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.
  As a result, current level does not include these items.
f Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary
  levels in H. Con. Res. 71, pursuant to various provisions of the
  resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below
  excludes $47,660 million in budget authority, $22,467 million in
  outlays, and $150,003 million in revenues assumed in H. Con. Res. 71
  for discretionary spending not constrained by the budgetary caps
  established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) and
  subsequently amended, including spending that qualifies for
  adjustments pursuant to section 4205 of H. Con. Res. 71.
