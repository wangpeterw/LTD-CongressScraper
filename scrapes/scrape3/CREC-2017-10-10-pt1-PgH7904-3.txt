              HONORING THE LIFE OF ALTO ``BUD'' ADAMS, JR.

  (Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life of Bud Adams, who passed away at his home on Adams Ranch in 
Fort Pierce, Florida, on September 22. He was 91 years old.
  Mr. Adams was a larger-than-life cowboy. He was a fixture in 
Florida's agriculture community, and the patriarch of Adams Ranch, a 4-
generation family operation that spans 80 years and spreads across 
50,000 acres in Florida in four counties.
  After serving in the Navy in World War II, Bud began managing Adams 
Ranch with his father and quickly became a legend among Florida 
cattlemen for innovations like the development of the Braford breed of 
beef cattle, a breed capable of withstanding Florida's hot and rainy 
summers.
  He has also served as the president of the Florida Cattlemen's 
Association and is a member of Florida's Agricultural Hall of Fame.
  He was an avid outdoor photographer and award-winning 
conservationist. He has shown a generation of farmers and ranchers and 
admirers like me that it is possible to work the land while still 
preserving God's beauty.
  Bud is survived by his loving wife, Dot, of 67 years, his three sons, 
his 14 grandchildren, and his nine great-grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, Florida has lost one of its greatest sons, and it was an 
honor for me to serve him here in the House.
