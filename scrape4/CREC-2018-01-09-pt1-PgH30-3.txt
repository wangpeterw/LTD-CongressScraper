              CELEBRATING LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today, on Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day, to commend law enforcement officers 
throughout our Nation who answer the call to serve their communities.
  Law enforcement officers face increasingly difficult circumstances 
while working to serve and protect the public. It is a dangerous job, 
and often it is a thankless job.
  Our officers put on their uniform each day knowing that they can be 
in harm's way at any moment. They answer the call in times of distress. 
They follow the rules, and they wear the badges proudly.
  This day is designated annually, on January 9, to show support to our 
law enforcement leaders in every community, including the Capitol 
Police, who are with us here today.
  Madam Speaker, we must remember that our officers are mothers and 
fathers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives. They are human, and 
they, arguably, have one of the most difficult jobs in America.
  So today, and each day, let's honor our brothers and sisters in blue. 
Let's thank them for the important work that they do to keep us all 
safe.
