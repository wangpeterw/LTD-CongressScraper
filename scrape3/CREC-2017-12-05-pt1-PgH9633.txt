                 CHANGE PALESTINIAN PAY-TO-SLAY POLICY

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Taylor Force 
Act, offered by my colleague from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn). This bill is 
named after Taylor Force, who was killed in Tel Aviv last year by a 
Palestinian terrorist wielding a knife.
  As part of the Palestinian Authority's ``pay-to-slay'' policy in 
which families of terrorists are rewarded for murdering Americans and 
Israelis, relatives of Force's killer now receive a $400 monthly 
stipend. The average monthly income for Palestinians in the West Bank 
is only $150. This policy doubles, or even triples, a family's earnings 
overnight.
  This policy directly encourages terrorism and incentivizes the murder 
of Americans and our allies. Payments to families of terrorists have 
reached $355 million in 2017. The Taylor Force Act ceases any continued 
U.S. aid to Palestinian interests until these so-called martyr payments 
are permanently ceased.
  The U.S. currently sends $300 million in aid to Palestinian 
interests. We shouldn't send a penny more until this heinous policy is 
abolished for good.
