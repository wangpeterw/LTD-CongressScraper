                       18TH NORTHERN HONOR FLIGHT

 Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, today I wish to honor the 
veterans of the Northern Colorado Honor Flight and the organization's 
18th trip to Washington, DC. More than 120 veterans from various wars 
and generations participated in this flight.
  The Northern Colorado Honor Flight recognizes and celebrates the 
bravery, fortitude, and selflessness of our Nation's veterans. Twice a 
year, veterans are able to travel to Washington, DC, and visit the war 
memorials that stand in their honor, free of charge. We are eternally 
indebted to those who have served in our Armed Forces and have 
protected the United States. These veterans have preserved our rights 
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
  Few words are sufficient to show the gratitude and respect we all 
have for the courageous men and women who have fought for our country. 
Of the 123 veterans who participated in the most recent honor flight, 
11 served in WWII, 24 served in the Korean war, and 88 served in the 
Vietnam war.
  Please join me in honoring Cecil Carlisle, Richard Crum, Edgar 
Darrow, Charles Davis, Eugene Doering, Muriel Elijah, Armand Hansen,
