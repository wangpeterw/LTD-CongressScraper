                       AMERICAN PHARMACISTS MONTH

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
month of October 2017 as American Pharmacists Month.
  During this month, I would like to recognize all pharmacists across 
America to ensure that Americans have access to important and often 
lifesaving medications.
  As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I am proud to 
recognize the work that pharmacists are doing to promote a healthy 
America. Every day, pharmacists provide vaccines for a number of 
illnesses and

carefully counsel patients on prescriptions and over-the-counter 
medications to help heal sickness and reduce pain. Pharmacists are also 
considered one of the top two most trusted professions in America.
  During October, as well as throughout the year, I encourage everyone 
to visit your pharmacist, ask questions about your prescriptions, 
receive advice about preventative care, and get to know the person who 
provides your medicine and works to keep you healthy.
  Thank you, fellow pharmacists, for all that you do. Please know that 
your work is appreciated and you are an important part of keeping our 
Nation healthy.
