          CAREER, TECHNICAL, AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, President Trump 
introduced his infrastructure plan, and while it covered many 
conventional infrastructure questions, it also singled out the need to 
modernize career, technical, and vocational education programs.
  At a time when 6 million jobs across the country remain vacant 
because employers can't find workers with the skills they require, it 
is vital that we expand these programs to meet the needs of students, 
workers, and businesses.
  The President's plan highlights the importance of modernizing career, 
technical, and vocational education programs to guarantee that workers 
have the skills necessary to succeed in their chosen career. Last 
month, as well, the President chose to highlight the importance of 
career and technical education to our economy in his State of the Union 
Address.
  Fortunately, the House has already passed Congressman Thompson's and 
my bill to reauthorize Career Technical Education programs. Now, with

the President's support, I am confident that our Senate colleagues will 
act and move this bipartisan legislation further without undue delay.
  Our students need it, our businesses need it, and our economy needs 
it right now.
