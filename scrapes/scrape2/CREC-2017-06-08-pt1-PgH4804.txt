                          TWO IMPORTANT ISSUES

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss two issues and to 
speak on their impact to the American people.
  The first one is the Financial CHOICE Act, which we just debated. I 
oppose it for the very reason that we passed Dodd-Frank. We passed it 
to respond to the greatest recession in 80 years, which saw a financial 
crisis that caused working men and women to lose the greatest amount of 
wealth they have ever lost. Yet, our colleagues here believe that it is 
important to choose large corporate interests over working men and 
women.
  At the same time, today we heard the testimony of Director Comey 
under oath. He gave a list of very troublesome acts and words offered 
by the President of the United States. Shortly thereafter, the 
President's lawyer, who was not under oath, came forward to deny, 
disparage, and suggest that Director Comey was not telling the truth.
  That is clearly an indication that the Judiciary Committee should 
begin an inquiry. That is our jurisdictional duty: to begin an inquiry 
to discern who is telling the truth. The FBI is under our jurisdiction.
  It is time for the House to hold hearings now. The truth must be 
known by the American people.
