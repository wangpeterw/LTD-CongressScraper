           THE 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM ACT IS NEEDED REFORM

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, a wise man said that insanity is doing the 
same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
  The definition of public bankruptcy is not having enough public taxes 
to pay public debts.

[[Page H9267]]

  This means that the current National Flood Insurance Program is both 
insane and bankrupt. It is insane because taxpayers pay when others' 
homes are flooded. They pay again when the same homes are flooded a 
second time and a third time and a fourth time.
  The GAO confirmed that the National Flood Insurance Program has 
created a flood of taxpayer debt; $23 billion in March of 2016. Three 
recent major hurricanes on the Gulf Coast doesn't help.
  Because Texas 22 had record floods when Hurricane Harvey hit in May, 
I was proud to be one of 237 Members to vote for needed reform, the 
21st Century Flood Reform Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Senate colleagues to do the same. Give America 
a Christmas present before Santa Claus comes to town.
