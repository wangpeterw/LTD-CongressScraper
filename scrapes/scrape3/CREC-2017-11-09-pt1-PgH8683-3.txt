                     PROTECTING ELECTORAL INTEGRITY

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, study after study has shown that illegal 
voting is extraordinarily rare and voter fraud is almost nonexistent.
  Instead of spending taxpayer money chasing after mythical claims of 
voter fraud, the Federal Government must address actual threats to our 
electoral system. It is imperative that the Federal Government protect 
the integrity of our elections, but the administration seems interested 
in only chasing voter fraud unicorns.
  The real threats to our democracy are voter suppression, 
cybersecurity, weaknesses, and foreign meddling.
  To protect the integrity of our elections, we must expand voting 
rights for all Americans, we must modernize our voting systems, and we 
must appoint an independent commission to investigate foreign meddling 
in the electoral system before the 2018 Federal election.
