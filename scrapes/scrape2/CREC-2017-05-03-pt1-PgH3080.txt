               REPEAL AND REPLACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I hope that tomorrow the House has the 
opportunity to deliver on the promise that the President made and 
Republicans made to finally repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act 
which is crumbling around us.
  Mr. Speaker, we do everything we said we would do. Maintain coverage 
for preexisting conditions and guarantee it, check. In fact, with the 
MacArthur amendment and the Palmer amendment, we establish high-risk 
pools that will actually bring down the premium costs for people with 
preexisting conditions, as it will for all Americans.
  Guarantee coverage and renewability, check. Coverage for people up to 
age 26 on their parents' plan, check. No discrimination based on 
gender, check.
  And most importantly, in the Medicaid program, we not only preserve 
but strengthen coverage for our elderly, sick, disabled, and pregnant 
women on that plan.
  Mr. Speaker, it is about time we repeal and replace the Affordable 
Care Act.
