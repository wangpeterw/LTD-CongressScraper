                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Capitol Hill United Methodist Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  O God, at the end of this week where we have raised up great men, 
celebrating the life of George Washington and mourning the death of 
Billy Graham, focus us now on the life and death of Jesus, example to 
some and Saviour to others.
  At the start, He was tempted in the wilderness to put himself above 
You. Save us, Lord, from lies about our own power.
  At every opportunity, Jesus found the sick, the lame, and the ones 
overlooked by the religious and political establishments. Send us today 
to those without earthly power but treasured by You.
  At His death, He refused to pick up a weapon, and willfully loved 
those who meant Him harm. God, may we do the same.
  And at the tomb, He rose out of the impossible, empowering a few 
women to share the good news. May we, too, from the highest ranking 
Member to the newest staffer, be authentic messengers of Your love.
  Amen and Amen.
