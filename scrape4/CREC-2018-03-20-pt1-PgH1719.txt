                       BRAIN INJURY AWARENESS DAY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today is Brain Injury 
Awareness Day, and I welcome those who are in Washington today to share 
their stories.
  This issue is near and dear to my heart. For nearly 30 years, this 
was my area of practice and expertise as a therapist and rehabilitation 
services manager. I served as a board member for the Brain Injury 
Association of Pennsylvania and helped form a brain injury support 
group.
  The theme for this year's campaign is Change Your Mind. This public 
awareness campaign strives to destigmatize brain injury; empower those 
who have survived, as well as their caregivers; and promote the many 
types of support available.
  The need to raise awareness is great. More than 2.8 million Americans 
sustain traumatic brain injuries in the United States each year.
  The 13 million Americans living with brain injuries want what we all 
want: to be defined by who they are as people, not by their injury.
  Mr. Speaker, everyone recovers at a different pace, and we should do 
everything in our power to support and encourage brain injury 
survivors. They deserve no less.
