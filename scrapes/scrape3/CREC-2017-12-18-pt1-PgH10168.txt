                       RECOGNIZING JOHN ANDERSON

  (Mr. FERGUSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
distinguished career of John Anderson of Kia Motors. John is retiring 
at the end of this year, after 33 years in the auto industry.
  From General Motors, to Delphi, to Kia, John has seen the ups and 
downs of the auto industry and has more than earned his retirement. 
But, this is a bittersweet moment for many of us in my hometown of West 
Point, Georgia.
  Kia opened a Washington office in conjunction with opening its 
manufacturing plant in 2010. The plant opened when I was mayor and 
Sonny Perdue was Governor. John was on the job then and has been there 
every day as the head of Washington's office since it opened.
  From the beginning of his career at Disney's Epcot Center, when he 
was the General Motors guy explaining the future of the industry, to 
his current role at Kia, John has made the automotive industry better; 
and he has done it with a remarkable touch of humanity and friendship 
along the way.
  John has been a great advocate for my hometown, for my district, and 
for the industry of Kia that now calls it home. As he moves into 
retirement with his wife, Joanna, as they get to spend a little time 
together, we wish him well in his retirement.
