                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Father, teach us how to praise You at all times, constantly 
glorifying Your Name and expressing gratitude for Your prevailing 
providence.
  Lord, thank You for sustaining our lawmakers as they strive to 
fulfill Your purposes for our Nation and world. Set them free from all 
fears, reminding them that You have been their help in the past and 
should be their hope for the years to come.
  Forgive us all for duties unperformed, promptings disobeyed, and 
beckonings ignored.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
