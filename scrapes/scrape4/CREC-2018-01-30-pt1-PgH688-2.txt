                            ECONOMIC REVIVAL

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, today is State of the Union day, and it 
is an opportunity for the Nation to hear from the President on the 
progress we have been making and the challenges that lie ahead.
  One thing I am looking forward to is hearing about how the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act and the regulatory reforms we have seen over the past year 
are causing our economy to roar back to life, creating more jobs and 
putting more money in people's pockets.
  Fifty-five years ago, President Kennedy delivered a State of the 
Union that recognized the power of tax cuts that put money back into 
the private sector. Talking about the economy, President Kennedy said: 
``To achieve these greater gains, one step, above all, is essential . . 
. a substantial reduction and revision in Federal income taxes.''
  I am glad President Trump and Congress have followed President 
Kennedy's and President Reagan's model. The economic revival happening 
today is not only lifting incomes, it is what is going to generate the 
tax revenues that will help us meet the challenges that lie ahead. That 
is something for all Americans to celebrate.
