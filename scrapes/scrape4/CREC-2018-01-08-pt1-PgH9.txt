      HEALTH INSURANCE FOR AMERICANS WORKING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, today there is an estimated 11 million 
Americans working for small businesses who lack employer-sponsored 
health insurance.
  The reality is that families across the country are struggling to 
afford coverage; they are priced out of plans and left with few 
options.
  Last week, President Trump's Department of Labor proposed a rule to 
help these 11 million Americans, a move deserving of ample support.
  The rule would enhance the market leverage of small groups, as well 
as individuals, by giving associations a meaningful role on the same 
playing field large corporations enjoy.
  For example, a farmer will be able to buy insurance through the 
national Farm Bureau plan, or a restaurant manager could let his 
employees buy insurance through the National Restaurant Association.
  Association plans are able to reduce costs by sharing risks in a 
larger pool, allowing flexibility to design plans to meet workers' 
needs, increasing negotiating power to lower prices with providers or 
drug prices.
  It is not a complete fix for ObamaCare, but it is certainly a big 
leap in the right direction, allowing workers that are in small 
businesses to have more choices, better than what they have now.
