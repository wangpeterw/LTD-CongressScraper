                               TAX REFORM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West 
Virginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, everyone remembers the 
excitement of receiving that first paycheck and the feeling of 
accomplishment that hard work brings. We also remember just as vividly 
the disappointment we experienced when we saw just how much of our 
hard-earned money went to taxes.
  It is a rite of passage that we have grown used to, but that doesn't 
mean it is right. Americans deserve to take home more of their pay.
  That is exactly why we need tax reform, tax cuts, and tax 
simplification, and why I am working with President Donald Trump to 
make our tax system work for West Virginia's families.
  Our tax framework would cut taxes for West Virginia's middle class 
families, double the standard deduction for individuals and couples, 
and create jobs by making small businesses and American companies more 
competitive.
  West Virginia's families work hard and have been squeezed by our 
State's economic downturn. Under our tax framework and with the support 
of President Trump, help is on the way.
  We will also make it easier and simpler for Americans--West 
Virginians--to file their taxes. Most families will be able to file 
their taxes just on a postcard, saving them both time and money.
  Our plan for tax reform, our plan for tax cuts, our plan for tax 
simplification will help us build a better America, a better West 
Virginia, one where families have more opportunities, more jobs, and 
more money in their pockets.
