                      SECURING AMERICA'S ELECTIONS

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)

[[Page H1320]]

  

  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security has 
confirmed that 21 State electoral systems were targeted in the 2016 
election, revealing vulnerabilities and jeopardizing the integrity of 
our elections and our democracy as people lose confidence that their 
vote matters and that it will actually and accurately be counted.
  In 2016, DEF CON, the world's largest hacking conference, revealed 
startling vulnerabilities in our election's infrastructure. We must 
take action now to safeguard our electoral infrastructure and ensure 
that each and every American vote is counted accurately.
  I am introducing the Securing America's Elections Act, which will not 
only provide the American people with a voter-verified, reliable, and 
independent paper record of their votes that can be implemented before 
the 2018 elections but will also address the effectiveness and security 
of our electronic voting software.
  We must act now to secure our elections and renew our citizens' faith 
in the integrity of those elections.
