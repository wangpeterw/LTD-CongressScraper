               HONORING DR. BILLY GRAHAM'S 99TH BIRTHDAY

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Dr. Billy 
Graham, a revered national treasure, who celebrates his 99th birthday 
today.
  The world honors Dr. Graham's birthday because of a decision he made 
83 years ago. On November 1, 1934, at a Mordecai Ham tent revival in 
Charlotte, North Carolina, young Billy Graham accepted Jesus as his 
personal Savior and committed his life to telling others about Jesus' 
love and forgiveness. God used that decision to impact countless lives 
around the world.
  While Presidents have sought his counsel over many decades and 
millions have gone forward to accept Jesus Christ at his meetings, Dr. 
Graham is remembered most for honoring and following his Lord and 
master.
  On a personal note, I first met Dr. Graham back in 1971 when I served 
as his caddy at the Byron Nelson Pro-Am, playing with Byron Nelson, Bob 
Hope, and Arnold Palmer. That was a fun time, but I have admired his 
walk with Jesus ever since.
  Happy birthday, Dr. Graham.
