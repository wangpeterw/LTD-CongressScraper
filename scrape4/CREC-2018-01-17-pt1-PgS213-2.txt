                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, whose Kingdom is above all earthly kingdoms, we praise 
Your Holy Name. Forgive us for having left undone the things we ought 
to have done and for doing the things we ought not to have done. 
Deliver us from those forces that obstruct the making of a nation and 
world of justice, peace, and righteousness.
  Lord, give our lawmakers the wisdom, courage, and strength needed for 
our times, providing them with Your sustenance from the wealth of Your 
celestial riches. Equip them to serve You and country with a full 
measure of grace, strength, and wisdom.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
