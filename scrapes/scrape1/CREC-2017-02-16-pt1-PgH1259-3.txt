                               INTEGRITY

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the United States of America is known 
for many things. It is known for its integrity, its honesty, and its 
high moral compass.
  We are well aware that the United States intelligence community is 
united in its assessment that Russia attacked our Nation in 2016, and 
interfered in our elections. In response, President Obama imposed 
sanctions on the Russian Government and personnel entities, including 
intelligence services. He also expelled dozens of Russian officials 
from the United States. Now, we know that General Flynn, in violation 
of many laws, intruded and discussed these issues with the Russian 
Ambassador.
  His departure does not end this investigation. Who knew what, when? 
When did the President know it? The integrity of this country is higher 
and more superior than one individual.
  Why, when other Presidents have used Camp David and the White House 
for international diplomacy most often, did we have, over the past 
weekend, the embarrassment of international and national security 
issues, and personnel being filmed in an ordinary restaurant owned by 
the President?
  Finally, let me say, with the many hundreds of thousands of DACA 
children who need relief, the question is: Can the President attend to 
serious business fighting for these young people and saving lives?
