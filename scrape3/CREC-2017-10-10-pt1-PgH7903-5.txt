     THE VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL TRAVELING WALL VISITS CENTRE COUNTY, 
                              PENNSYLVANIA

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, I had 
the opportunity to participate in both the opening and the closing 
ceremonies for the traveling version of the Vietnam War Memorial Wall. 
The traveling wall was in State College last Thursday through Sunday, 
and it was a truly moving experience for all those who visited.
  The theme for Centre County was ``Welcome Home.'' We all know that in 
many instances, our Vietnam veterans did not receive a warm welcome 
home when they returned from war. This is a scar on our history and one 
that we are working to heal.
  The traveling wall serves as a reminder of the efforts to promote 
liberty and freedom that our Vietnam veterans put forth. It finally 
recognizes their struggles and thanks them for their service after 
years of underappreciation.
  Mr. Speaker, the wall tells the story of so many Americans. They were 
sons and daughters. They were our friends and our neighbors. They are 
American heroes.
  It is never too late to honor our veterans to ensure that they 
receive the recognition that they deserve.
