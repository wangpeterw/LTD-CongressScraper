          CONGRATULATING CONGRESSMAN STIVERS ON HIS PROMOTION

  (Mr. LATTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my Ohio colleagues to 
congratulate our colleague Steve Stivers on this great momentous 
occasion of being promoted to brigadier general.
  I have known my friend since our days in the Ohio General Assembly. I 
remember when he was deployed for his service that he so unselfishly 
gave to his Nation in uniform.
  With Steve, you can go back in history. It was 242 years ago last 
week, on April 18, 1775, that Paul Revere, Dawes, and Prescott rode 
across the countryside and said that the regulars were out.
  It was on the morning of April 19 that men left their shops, left 
their plows, and went to that call. It was that citizen soldier that 
went out there to make sure that this Nation attained the freedom that 
we have today.
  From the National Guard and all of our men and women that are serving 
in uniform across all the services, it is because of them that we have 
the right to stand here today.
  I applaud Congressman Stivers on his promotion to brigadier. And we, 
along with our colleagues in the Senate, congratulate him. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank him very much for his service.
