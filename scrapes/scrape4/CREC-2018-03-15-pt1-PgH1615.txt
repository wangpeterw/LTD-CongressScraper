        HONORING THE NATION'S TEACHERS DURING PUBLIC SCHOOL WEEK

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Lance). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our Nation's 
dedicated teachers during this year's Public School Week.
  When I think back to my teachers in public school, one in particular 
stands out: Ms. Eleanor Ball, my eighth grade English teacher. In 
addition to instilling in me a love and respect for the English 
language, she was a teacher who went above and beyond the call of duty 
and gave each of us youngsters a sense of confidence to face the 
challenges that would lie ahead in our society.
  But who are the Ms. Balls of today? Perhaps they are like Cristina 
Stout, a 4th grade teacher at Leading Creek Elementary School in Gilmer 
County, West Virginia. Ms. Stout is known for her compassion for her 
students. She often buys school supplies and winter coats for kids 
whose families can't afford them. One year she gave up every lunch 
break, every day, so that just one of her students who suffers with a 
sensory issue could eat in her classroom with her and avoid the 
overstimulating cafeteria. Most days, she stays late to tutor students 
who need the extra care, help, and assistance to ensure that they don't 
fall behind.
  These are just two of countless examples of our Nation's teachers 
going above and beyond the call of duty every day across America.
  To Ms. Ball, Ms. Stout, and teachers everywhere, we thank you, from 
the bottom of our hearts.
