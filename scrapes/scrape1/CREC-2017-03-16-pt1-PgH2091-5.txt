                     THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF CRIMEA

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this week marks 3 years since Russia 
violated Ukraine's territorial integrity and illegally stole Crimea.
  In 2014, the people of Ukraine peacefully decided to move closer to 
the European Union and away from the Russian sphere of influence. 
However, the Napoleon of Siberia would have none of it. Russian troops 
invaded the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine. Little green men then invaded 
two more regions in eastern Ukraine.
  The Russian invasions have cost 10,000 Ukrainian lives, but Russia 
has not stopped. Troops are pursuing a slow strategy to take more and 
more territory in eastern Ukraine.
  Russia has invaded a sovereign country and taken over its lands. Mr. 
Speaker, what country is next?
  The American people must stand with Ukraine and against the tyranny 
of the Russian bear. It is time to stand up to Putin. He must pay a 
price for his aggression. Sanctions against and isolation of the bear 
are good places to start.
  And that is just the way it is.
