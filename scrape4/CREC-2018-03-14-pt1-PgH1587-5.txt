                        PALMETTO WOMEN'S CENTER

  (Mr. NORMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
highlight a pro-life pregnancy center in my own district, the Palmetto 
Women's Center.
  The Palmetto Women's Center is focused on uniting hope, health, and 
healing to women as they bring a child into their family. The center 
provides women with pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, Biblical counseling, 
education from nurses, connections within the community for access to 
resources, and much, much more. For example, the center partners with 
the Rock Hill Salvation Army to ensure that soon-to-be mothers can have 
access to maternity clothing and baby supplies.
  The Palmetto Women's Center will be able to reach more women in my 
district as they begin operating in their new mobile unit. This will 
allow the staff of the center to travel throughout the district and 
provide women with the center's free services.
  Palmetto Women's Center is working to lower the number of abortions 
in South Carolina and supporting women as they choose life for their 
children. I

applaud the work that pro-life pregnancy centers are doing, and I will 
continue to be an advocate for them and for life.
