                           HUMAN TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. CULBERSON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, last year, over 7,000 cases of human 
trafficking were reported in the United States. Unfortunately, the city 
with the largest number of cases was our hometown of Houston, Texas.
  Human trafficking is an absolutely despicable and deplorable crime 
that demands swift action.
  As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee, I have spearheaded efforts to make sure that our Federal 
law enforcement officers have all the resources they need to crack down 
on these human traffickers, who are exploiting our children and young 
women coming across our borders.

[[Page H6312]]

  We have to work together to provide justice and relief for these 
victims. That is why Congress has passed 16 bipartisan bills to combat 
this human trafficking epidemic.
  These bills ensure that all law enforcement officers at the State, 
Federal, and local level have the resources they need and the support 
they need to fight this overwhelming crisis.
  I am proud to support these measures, and I will continue to work 
with my colleagues to ensure that we crack down and drop the hammer on 
human traffickers.
