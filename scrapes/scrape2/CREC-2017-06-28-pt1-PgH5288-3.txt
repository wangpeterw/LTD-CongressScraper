                TAX BILL DISGUISED AS A HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I am angry.
  I am angry that Republicans are trying to fool the American people. 
The Republican healthcare bill is nothing more than a tax bill 
disguised as a healthcare bill.
  TrumpCare is an almost $570 billion tax break for health insurance 
companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the extremely wealthy. It is a 
bill that asks working families to pay more for less: less coverage, 
less access, and less care.
  Recently, a concerned constituent called my office after discovering 
that his son would need surgery at birth for a heart defect and then 
subsequent surgeries later on. He wanted to know what he could do to 
stop TrumpCare and protect his son, who would be born with a 
preexisting condition and face thousands of dollars of cost throughout 
his life.
  Mr. Speaker, let's pass healthcare legislation that invests in and 
protects the healthcare of all Americans, holds the healthcare industry 
accountable, and lowers cost.
