                         TAX RELIEF IS UPON US

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last month, Congress 
passed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
  Tax relief is upon us for American workers, families, and job 
creators. Come February, there will be more money in your paycheck.
  Workers are already seeing the benefits of this historic tax cuts 
bill. Businesses across the country are now giving bonuses, pay raises, 
and making new investments that will get our economy back on track.
  Pennsylvania's own AccuWeather provided a year-end bonus to all 
employees due to the strong confidence in the United States and global 
economy now that tax reform passed.
  And AccuWeather isn't alone. Thanks to tax reform, Wells Fargo 
boosted its minimum wage for employees to $15 an hour and targeted $400 
million in nonprofit donations this year. AT&T paid more than 200,000 
U.S. employees $1,000 each and increased its capital spending budget by 
$1 billion. Sinclair Broadcast Group paid $1,000 bonuses to nearly 
9,000 employees.
  These are just some of the many businesses that are rewarding their 
employees, thanks to tax reform, fair and simple.
