           OPERATING UNDER A CONTINUING RESOLUTION IS UNWISE

  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, think back to school. You go to your 
teacher and say: My term paper is not done yet. Can I get an extension?
  Well, okay, as a reasonable teacher, you can give them an excuse 
maybe once. Twice, not very many. Three times, I never knew a teacher 
like that. Four times, no way.
  You are 114 days late with the budget for the government of the 
United States of America, which includes the military and everything 
else that you are carrying on about.
  Let's listen to Secretary Mattis talking about your continuing 
resolutions running the government bit by bit:

       Operating under a continuing resolution is unwise as can 
     be. It makes us rigid. We cannot deal with new and revealing 
     threats.

  We know our enemies are not standing still.
  You are bragging about funding the government for 30 days?
  You have not done your most basic function as a ruling majority of 
the House, the Senate, and the White House, and that is, to give us 
proper funding for the entire government.
  In transportation, we have lost $1.4 billion. That is 21,000 jobs.
  Do your job.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their 
remarks to the Chair.
