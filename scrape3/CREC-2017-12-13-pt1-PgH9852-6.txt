          RECOGNIZING 2017 CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNERS

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three high 
school students from Kennewick, Washington, as the winners of 
Washington's Fourth District 2017 Congressional App Challenge.
  Seth Florman, Damon Fuller, and Kyler Zimmerman spent many hours 
creating and refining an app they named Powerhouse, which enables the 
user to take on the role of businessowner of an energy company. These 
students designed the app to illustrate an energy company's 
responsibilities to the community and to draw attention to the 
challenges energy providers face.
  Thank you to our panel of judges and to the engineers at Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory who will be providing the winners with a 
tour of their great facility.

science and coding, and I am proud to represent central Washington, 
where schools and teachers are dedicated to encouraging students to 
excel in STEM education.
  This year, the Fourth Congressional District's App Challenge had the 
highest number of entries since my office began participating in the 
contest, which is a testament to the creativity of our young people.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Seth, Damon, and 
Kyler on their wining app, Powerhouse, and I look forward to their 
continued educational and professional success.
