                  CRITICAL BILL FOR AMERICAN AVIATION

  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, today, most actions in Congress are viewed 
through a partisan lens, but the 21st Century AIRR Act is a bill with 
significant support from both Republicans and Democrats, as well as a 
number of groups representing a wide array of political ideologies.
  Modernizing air traffic control has historically been a bipartisan 
issue. In fact, 20 years ago, then-President Clinton said: ``The FAA's 
20-year effort to modernize its air traffic control technology simply 
has not been able to keep pace with either the emergence of new 
technology or the growth and demand for air travel. . . . We can 
continue on the current course and continue to experience crowded 
airports, flight delays, and even higher passenger frustration. But if 
we act now to improve our infrastructure, we can ensure that air travel 
in the 21st century is the safest, most cost-effective, most efficient 
in the world.''
  These words are still true today.
  Because we have failed to act decisively, the FAA is struggling to 
give Americans the 21st century air traffic control system they 
deserve. We have the opportunity to change that with the AIRR Act.
  Many former top administration officials from both parties support 
reform as well as a broad coalition of stakeholders.
  Air traffic control reform hasn't been a partisan issue, and it 
shouldn't become one now. I urge all my colleagues to pass this 
critical bill for American aviation.
