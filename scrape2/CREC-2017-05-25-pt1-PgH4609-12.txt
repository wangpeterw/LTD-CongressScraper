           By Mr. LUETKEMEYER:
       H.R. 2706.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       The constitutional authority on which this bill rests is 
     the explicit power of Congress to regulate commerce in and 
     among the states, as enumerate in Article 1, Section 8, 
     Clause 3, the Commerce Clause, of the United States 
     Constitution, and Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1, which 
     grants Congress the ability to make laws necessary to carry 
     out that power. Additionally, Article I, Section 7, Clause 2 
     of the Constitution allows for every bill passed by the House 
     of Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President 
     to be made law; and therefore it implicitly allows Congress 
     to amend any bill that has been passed by both chambers and 
     signed into law by the President.
