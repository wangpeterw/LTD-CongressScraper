       70. The SPEAKER presented a petition of State 
     Representative Luis Arroyo, relative to Illinois House 
     Resolution 164, encouraging the 115th Congress to introduce 
     and pass new legislation on the admission of Puerto Rico as 
     the 51st state; to the Committee on Natural Resources.
       71. Also, a petition of Mr. Gregory D. Watson, a citizen of 
     Austin, TX, relative to urging Congress to propose, pursuant 
     to Article V, an amendment to the United States Constitution 
     that would, in addition to congressional proposal, likewise 
     allow an identically-worded suggested federal constitutional 
     amendment, approved by the legislatures of at least two-
     thirds of the several states, as an alternate means of 
     proposing future amendments and that would further provide 
     for a same-day nationwide referendum as the exclusive method 
     of ratifying any future amendments; thus repealing all 
     references to a national proposing convention, repealing all 
     references to ratifying conventions conducted within the 
     individual states, and repealing all references to state 
     legislative ratification.
