                  CELEBRATING NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 44th 
anniversary of National Agriculture Day, which is celebrated in 
classrooms and communities across the country. This year's theme is 
``Agriculture: Food for Life.''
  Today marks a nationwide effort to tell the true story of American 
agriculture and remind citizens that agriculture is a part of all of 
us. The National Ag Day program encourages every American to understand 
how food and fiber products are produced; appreciate the role 
agriculture plays in providing safe, abundant, and affordable products; 
value the essential role of agriculture in maintaining a strong 
economy; and acknowledge and consider career opportunities in the 
agriculture, food, and fiber industry.
  America's next wave of agriculture leaders are also in Washington 
today: members of the National FFA Organization, 4-H, Agriculture of 
America, and MANRRS. Their advocacy and leadership is critical to the 
future of agriculture.
  Mr. Speaker, our farmers feed and agriculture plays a critical role 
in modern society. I would like to thank all Americans who work in this 
essential industry.
  Happy Ag Day.
