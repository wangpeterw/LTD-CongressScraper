     NEIL ``SUDS'' SUTHERLAND, A DEDICATED FIREFIGHTER FOR 53 YEARS

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding 
constituent and volunteer firefighter from the 22nd District, Neil 
Sutherland, otherwise known as ``Suds.''
  Neil has been a member of the Stittville Fire Department since 1965 
and fire chief since 1998. Throughout his 53 years of dedicated fire 
service, Chief Sutherland has led the Stittville Fire Department to 
become one of the most well-respected departments in the State.
  Stittville Fire Department is also one of the busiest fire 
departments in our region, handling over 220 calls a month. Incredibly, 
Chief Suds Sutherland has responded to 90 percent of those calls.
  Chief Sutherland is also an active player on the Stittville Volunteer 
softball team, the undefeated league champions for the past 3 years.
  Recently, Chief Sutherland was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On 
Saturday, I had the honor of joining our community and the Sutherland 
family at a beautiful ceremony benefiting Chief Sutherland and his 
dedication and service to our community.
  Tragically, medical research shows that firefighters have a much 
greater risk of contracting cancer due to increased exposure to smoke 
and toxins.
  Chief Sutherland's enduring spirit and unwavering commitment to 
community is an inspiration to us all. I ask everyone to join me in 
sending our thoughts and our prayers to Chief Sutherland, otherwise 
lovingly known as ``Suds,'' and his family during his courageous battle 
to beat cancer.
