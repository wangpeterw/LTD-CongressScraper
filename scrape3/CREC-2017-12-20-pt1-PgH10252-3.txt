                HONORING THE LIFE OF EVELYN WRIGHT MOORE

  (Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, December 15, Brazoria 
County lost one of its great community leaders, Ms. Evelyn Wright 
Moore.
  Evelyn dedicated her entire life to early childhood development and 
education. In 1975, in fact, she started her career as the Brazoria 
County Head Start coordinator; and, after a very short 8 years with 
that organization, she was running the show and continued running that 
show for the rest of her life. Evelyn made sure her students were 
receiving the support that would allow them to thrive in that 
community.
  Brazoria County Head Start now enrolls just over 490 students, thanks 
to her. That program was championed by Evelyn's passion and her devout 
dedication to those same students.
  She and I met many times over the years, both in Brazoria and here in 
Washington, D.C., and I will greatly miss our conversations. The legacy 
of Evelyn's servant heart will long be remembered and cherished.
  Evelyn, my dear friend, you are now safe in the arms of Jesus.
