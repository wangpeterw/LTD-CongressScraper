                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Beautiful Savior, You have been our dwelling place in all 
generations, and we are sustained by Your steadfast love. Today, 
surround our Senators with the shield of Your favor, as they labor to 
keep our Nation strong.
  Lord, teach them to be obedient to Your commands, doing Your good 
will as Your presence fills them with joy. May they be quick to listen, 
slow to speak, and slow to anger. Manifest Your power throughout their 
labors, so that this Nation will be exalted by righteousness.
  May Your angels guard us in all our ways.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
