           HONOR FLIGHT NORTHERN COLORADO'S 20TH FLIGHT TO DC

 Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the 
veterans of Honor Flight Northern Colorado who have made their 20th 
trip to Washington, DC, to visit memorials that stand in their honor. 
This group consists of veterans from various wars and generations, but 
all are linked by their service to our country.
  Founded in 2005, the Honor Flight program was originally formed to 
honor veterans that had served in World War II. The program has 
expanded and now welcomes veterans from across the country to fly to 
Washington, DC, free of charge, so that they can visit the national 
memorials dedicated to their service. These veterans have preserved our 
rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Few words 
sufficiently express the gratitude and respect we all have for these 
brave men and women. Of the 123 veterans on the most recent Honor 
Flight, 9 served in World War II, 25 served in Korea, and 89 served in 
Vietnam.
  Please join me in honoring Carl Curtis, Eugene Doty, Ben Gutfelder, 
Fred Heinze, James Ingram, Elwood Johnsen, George Kunz, Stuart Mundt,
