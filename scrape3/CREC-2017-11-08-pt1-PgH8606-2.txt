    HONORING MORGAN SCARBRO FOR HER WORK WITH VETERANS AND MILITARY 
                                FAMILIES

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable 
student in my district with a heart for helping veterans, our military, 
and their families. Morgan Scarbro is a 14-year-old from Eaton Rapids 
who created a nonprofit called Morgan's HUGS.
  Since the age of five, Morgan has been giving back to veterans. If 
there is a veteran in need, Morgan springs into action. She organizes 
donation drives and collects items like hygiene products, food, 
clothing, and more. When Morgan competes in beauty pageants, she 
encourages her fellow contestants to donate as well.
  Morgan helps in so many other ways, too, including visiting veterans 
in nursing homes and putting her own Christmas on hold to give presents 
to military families.
  Morgan's dad is a disabled veteran, and she has seen, firsthand, the 
sacrifices made by the men and women who serve our country. We owe them 
an immeasurable debt.
  As Veterans Day approaches, may we follow Morgan's example and do 
everything we can to take care of our Nation's heroes.
