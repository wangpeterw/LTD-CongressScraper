Mr.

[[Page H1022]]

Daniel DeLoach of Savannah, Georgia, who passed away on Sunday, January 
29, from complications of Proteus disease. He was 30 years old.
  Mr. DeLoach was born in Savannah to Mike and Julia DeLoach. His 
parents and his siblings, Michael and Kathleen, were his greatest 
source of support as he battled his disease.
  Though his debilitating condition required more than 100 surgeries in 
his lifetime, Mr. DeLoach wasn't known for his disease; he was known 
for his zest for life. Mr. DeLoach never regretted having the disease. 
Instead, he brightened every room he entered and never ceased to have a 
positive outlook on life. This outlook led him to accomplish some 
amazing feats while battling the illness.
  In 2005, he graduated from the Benedictine Military School in 
Savannah and went on to attend the Savannah College of Art and Design, 
where he earned a degree in industrial design. With his education and 
personal experience, it was Mr. DeLoach's goal to improve the care of 
patients and teach others how to best interact with them.
  Daniel continues to be an inspiration to all of us who were lucky 
enough to meet him, and his story bears repeating so it may inspire 
many others for years to come.
