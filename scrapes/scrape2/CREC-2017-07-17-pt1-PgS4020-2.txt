                         REMEMBERING DAVID DUFF

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember David Duff, a 
well-respected coal operator from Perry County, KY. David passed away 
on July 3 in Snowmass, CO, at the age of 67. He will be remembered by 
many for his kindness and generosity, especially toward the elderly, 
children, and our Nation's veterans.
  David owned Pine Branch Coal Company, employing hundreds of miners in 
eastern Kentucky and serving as a leader in the industry. He was dearly 
loved by many in his community, as was shown by the many signs posted 
along the road leading to his home in the days after his passing.
  Elaine and I send our condolences to David's wife, Susan, their 
children Lori and Ryan, their grandchildren, and all of their family 
and friends. We hope that their memories of David will help them 
through this time of grief.
