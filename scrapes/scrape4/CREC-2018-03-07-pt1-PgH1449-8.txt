           FEARS OF A TRADE WAR ARE BEING GREATLY EXAGGERATED

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, in his column yesterday, Pat 
Buchanan wrote that, through most of its history, the Republican Party 
was the high tariff party, favoring tariffs rather than income taxes. 
He wrote that those tariffs helped the U.S. to become the strongest 
industrial power in the world.
  In the 1950s and 1960s, 53 percent of American jobs were industrial 
based, many of them white collar. Now only around 10 percent are in 
manufacturing, and many thousands of college graduates are working as 
waiters and waitresses or in other low-paying jobs and living with 
their parents.
  Fears of a trade war are being greatly exaggerated. We have been in a 
trade war for many years, and we have been losing. With only 4 percent 
of the world's population, we buy almost 23 percent of the world's 
goods.
  Every country wants into our markets, and we have tremendous leverage 
on trade that we haven't been using. President Trump's proposed tariffs 
apply only to two products. I commend him for his effort to try to 
protect American jobs.
