     crisis, he has worked to keep America united and strong. . . 
     our country is better for his courage, his determination, and 
     his willingness to go the long course to lead America.''.

  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise also to talk about my dear friend 
and mentor, Bob Dole. Senator Dole just celebrated his 94th birthday, 
and I think it is obviously right and proper to honor his contributions 
to our Nation.

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 

  Let me tell you a little bit about Bob Dole. He comes from Russell, 
KS. You can't get any more Kansas than Russell. Growing up during the 
Great Depression, Bob Dole learned the values of hard work and 
discipline, which is the mark of a Kansas upbringing and the heart of 
what I call Kansas values.
  In 1941, Bob Dole enrolled at the University of Kansas as a premed 
student. During his time at KU, he played for the basketball, football, 
and track teams. Being a K-State alum, I don't always hold that against 
him, but his collegiate studies were interrupted by World War II. And 
when he answered the call to duty, he joined the U.S. Army. During a 
military offensive in Italy, he was very seriously wounded while trying 
to save a fellow soldier. Despite his grave injuries, Bob recovered and 
was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star with an Oak Leaf 
Cluster for his service. He is indeed a warrior and a hero.

  After the war, Bob returned to Kansas, studied the law, and was 
elected to the Kansas House of Representatives. He soon moved to the 
U.S. House of Representatives and served two Kansas districts from 1961 
to 1969, including my old district, if I can refer to it in that way, 
``The Big First.''
  In 1969, Bob Dole was elected to the U.S. Senate and served until 
1996. Now, over the course of this period, he served as chairman of the 
Republican National Committee, chairman of the Finance Committee, 
Senate minority leader, and then Senate majority leader.
  During his time in Washington, Senator Dole was known for his ability 
to work across the aisle and embrace practical bipartisanship on the 
issues, such as tax reform, Social Security, and many other pressing 
issues. I would call this the Kansas approach to legislating. He has 
been a lifelong advocate for the disabled and was a key figure in the 
passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act back in 1990.
  After his appointment as majority leader, Bob Dole set the record as 
the Nation's longest serving Republican leader in the Senate of the 
United States. Several Presidents of the United States have especially 
honored Bob for his hard work and leadership in the public sector. For 
example, President Reagan awarded Bob Dole the Presidential Citizens 
Medal in 1989.
  President Reagan stated:

       Whether on the battlefield or Capitol Hill, Senator Dole 
     has served America heroically. Serving as Senate Majority 
     Leader during one of the most productive Congresses of recent 
     time, he has also been a friend to veterans, farmers, and 
     Americans from every walk of life. Bob Dole has stood for 
     integrity, straight talk and achievement throughout his years 
     of distinguished public service.

  So said our former President, Ronald Reagan.
  As I said, they are Kansas values.
  Likewise, in 1997, President Clinton awarded Senator Dole with the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom saying:

       Son of the soil, citizen, soldier and legislator, Bob Dole 
     understands the American people, their struggles, their 
     triumphs and their dreams. . . . In times of conflict and 
     crisis, he has worked to keep America united and strong. . . 
     . Our country is better for his courage, his determination, 
     and his willingness to go the long course to lead America.

  So said our former President, Bill Clinton.
  Senator Dole remains active today, serving as the national chairman 
of the World War II Memorial Campaign, a memorial that simply would not 
be in existence today had it not been for his perseverance, leadership, 
and cochair of the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund.
  In 2007 President George W. Bush appointed Bob to cochair the 
President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded 
Warriors, which inspected and reformed the system of medical care 
received by U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.
  He remains the strongest advocate for veterans, having volunteered on 
a weekly basis for more than a decade on behalf of the national Honor 
Flight Network.
  As a person who has gone to the World War II Memorial, along with Bob 
Dole, I know I greet the veterans at the bus. They immediately get off 
the bus. Whether they are from Kansas or any other State, they are very 
proud to come to see their memorial. The first question they ask is 
this: Where is Bob? Is Bob here? Then, they flock to him like a mother 
hen. Maybe, that is not the best example, but it certainly shows the 
pride and the desire of our veterans to meet the man who did so much 
for their memorial.
  I am also proud that he serves today as the finance chairman of the 
campaign for the national Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial, leading the 
private fundraising effort to memorialize President Dwight David 
Eisenhower, our favorite son in Kansas, here in Washington, something 
near and dear to both of us. I am privileged to be the chairman of the 
Eisenhower Memorial Commission.
  It is abundantly clear that throughout his long service to our 
country, Bob Dole has embodied the American spirit of leadership and 
determination, and he serves as one of the most prolific role models 
both in and outside of politics.
  I am reminded of the time when I was stationed at Quantico as a young 
marine and my dad, Wes Roberts, who was

[[Page S4806]]

a friend and adviser to Bob, said: I want to take you up to the Hill to 
meet Congressman Bob Dole. I consider him to have the highest potential 
to be whatever he wants with regard to public service.
  So I went up to the Hill, and I met this handsome young man. He 
didn't sit on his hands very long in terms of what he wanted to 
accomplish. I first met him then, and, then, as a staffer for my 
predecessor, the Honorable Keith Sebelius, a congressman from ``The Big 
First'' and, then, as a Member of the House for 16 years.
  I tell the story that most people in the House thought that whatever 
I proposed or whatever I was for, Bob Dole was for me. Well, about 50 
percent of that was true, but I never told them about the other 50 
percent. So I was really able to get a lot done.
  Bob, thank you for that.
  I am so proud--so proud--to call him friend. I am proud to serve his 
State. I am equally proud today that each Senator--each and every 
Senator and colleagues on both sides of the aisle--have joined me in 
honoring Senator Bob Dole with a Congressional Gold Medal--all 100. It 
didn't take very long.
  I yield the floor
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                          ____________________
