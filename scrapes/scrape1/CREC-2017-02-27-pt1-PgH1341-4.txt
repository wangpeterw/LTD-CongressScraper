                  MOURNING THE LOSS OF AMERICAN LIVES

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I first start out by mourning the loss 
of two Indo-Americans in Kansas, friends of all of us. As I left India 
last week, you can imagine the horror of hearing of this incident by a 
Trump sympathizer. We must stop the spread of hate. I want to say to 
them, this community, and the people of India that we in America will 
stand by them, and we will stand against hate.
  I, too, want to add my mourning for a second time for the loss of the 
Navy SEAL who died in Yemen on January 28. I came to the floor some 
weeks ago to acknowledge my shock and concern about the precipitousness 
of this effort by the Trump administration in the first days of his 
administration.
  I join in asking for a full investigation, the whys, the wheres, the 
necessity of doing this operation within days of the beginning of the 
White House term. We don't take operations with our precious military 
souls lightly. It is important to be thoughtful and deliberative. 
Certainly it is important to be ready. It is also important not to 
signal what you are doing. I understand that.
  But I can't understand what happened and the tragic loss of this 
great Navy SEAL leader. We need answers, and we need them quick from 
the White House. Give them answers now. Investigate now.
