3293,topic-id,334,"Mr.President, joining my colleague here on the floor, I agree with all of the comments the Senator from Arizona has made. They are interesting because as to the history of the State of the Senator from Arizona and his family history, Judge Gorsuch has a similar history, to the point that his great-grandfather built a hotel in Wyoming called the Wolf Hotel, in Saratoga, I found a picture of that hotel from 1878, which was 12 years before Wyoming became a I got that picture from the American history museum at the University of Wyoming and got a copy of the picture and gave it to Judge  In front of the hotel in 1878, there was a stagecoach with six horses lined up ahead of it. The Wolf Hotel was a halfway stop on the stagecoach line between a couple of communities in They were about 40 miles apart. So that is the heritage from which Judge Gorsuch comes.  I think that western heritage is important. But I think that additionally important is what the Senator referred to--his judicial temperament, being such a mainstream member of the judiciary, and this general belief inherent within him that the role of a judge is to apply the law, not to legislate from the bench.  We have seen so much legislating from the bench. I think you just don't get that if you take somebody from the Rocky Mountain West who has this view of the Nation and an understanding of the rule of law and the  So I think we are going to see that when the Senate Judiciary Committee begins its hearings next week on Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme I visited with him, reviewed his writings, and then compared it to what I saw when I visited with Justice Scalia when he came to The Senator from Arizona mentioned the picture of the two working together, fishing together.

It can be very punishing, as we have seen over the last 8 years with regulations that have come out of agencies--sometimes, I believe, in defiance of the law, sometimes reversed by the Supreme  That is why I think it is critical to have Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, because he is someone who realizes that the Constitution is a legal document--not a living document, not built for flexibility, but really a rigid legal document. That is where I believe he stands. That is what his writings indicate. It is the sort of thing we have seen from him. I visited with him, and other Members have. These are the things we read about.  With regard to his writings over the years, this is a judge who has faithfully applied the law--applied the law, focusing on the He has not been afraid to rule against the government or for unpopular parties when the law demands it because he is going to go right back to the law.

3091,topic-id,258,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Smith, for yielding me time to speak on this important legislation.  It has become increasingly apparent with every major weather event that our forecasting services are desperately in need of a major overhaul. I am happy to support legislation that will do just that.  H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, will put our country's weather forecasting back on track to provide citizens with lifesaving predictions and warnings.  I specifically point to this bill's innovative language on weather technology planning. H.353 calls on NOAA to evaluate the combination of observing systems it needs to meet weather forecasting requirements. It also requires the agency to conduct experiments on different observing systems to evaluate their costs and benefits.  Such reforms will grant NOAA more flexibility to develop new technologies while scrapping older approaches that do not bring enough value to our forecasts. We need to better assess our observing system resources instead of continuing to rely on outdated methods.  This bill will help push NOAA to consider new approaches, including those from the private sector. For its part, the growing private sector has signaled it is ready and willing to work with NOAA to bring better weather forecasting to our citizens, and we should welcome this development.  I am confident that H.353 will create the kind of meaningful change that we want to see at This bill will better protect American lives and property with more accurate weather forecasting. I applaud the sponsors. I encourage all Members to support this bill.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2653-2.txt,99999999999999,ADVANCED NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2017,2017.0,4.0,March
3116,topic-id,377,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his support.  I rise today in support of critical legislation to support public safety and first responders, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, H.437.  My bill will help secure medical countermeasures for first responders, ensuring we are prepared for any type of emergency. For instance, last year, in Florida, we faced the outbreak of the Zika virus.  The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act means that reliable grant funding would be available to conduct medical preparedness activities such as planning, training, and purchasing protective equipment to combat Zika or other public health threats going forward nationwide. When the worst occurs, our first responders are there for us on the front lines.  I consistently find myself in awe of these brave men and women and the sacrifices they make on the public's behalf. They are heroes. The least we can do is make sure they have the tools they need to do their jobs and keep us safe. That is what my bill seeks to accomplish. We want to keep them safe as well, Mr. The legislation authorizes grant funds for the stockpiling of countermeasures, including medical kits, protective gear, ventilators, and more. This should give us all peace of mind to know this vital equipment will be there in case of a crisis.  Importantly, the grant fund used in H.437 already exists. The bill does not require new or additional funding. Also significant, this bill has received strong bipartisan support.  I thank my colleagues, Representatives Susan Brooks and Peter King, for being original cosponsors of H.437.  I was inspired to write this legislation during my time as subcommittee chairman on the Homeland Security Committee after a series of hearings with folks from the emergency response community. They expressed the urgent need for stockpiling these medical countermeasures and for providing first responders the assurance that grant funding may be used to support them now and in the future. They need certainty, Mr. I am proud to have the support of the Emergency Services Coalition for Medical Preparedness and the International Association of Fire Chiefs on this issue. The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act is going to make a difference to protect the public and protect our protectors. I strongly urge passage today.

Our community along the coast is prone to experiencing hurricanes and tropical storms on a regular basis. Flood insurance is a must where we live.  But right now, the National Flood Insurance Program bases its flood insurance rates on maps that can be 50 years or older. Many are completely out of date and often inaccurate. It is also one of the reasons that NFIP is over $23 billion in debt.  The Flood Insurance Integrity Act will require an open and transparent annual review of flood maps. It sounds good.  Americans who need flood insurance should be able to trust that their flood insurance premiums accurately reflect their flood risk. It is the least we can do.

3209,topic-id,596,"Mr.President, in the minutes remaining before this vote, I want to briefly call attention to an impending constitutional crisis we are facing in this Chamber and in this country as a result of recent revelations coming to our attention, literally within the last 24 hours, about contacts between now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, our former colleague, and the Russian  Nearly 2 months ago, my Judiciary colleagues and I were told by then-Senator Sessions--and the Presiding Officer is on the Judiciary We were told in no uncertain terms that he ``did not have communications with the Russians,'' and we took him at his word.  Last night, we learned that Senator Sessions' statement was inaccurate. These inaccurate, possibly intentionally false, statements misled us. They misled me, personally, and I feel they failed to provide the whole truth about his communications with and ties to the Russians, likely on behalf of the Trump campaign. These contacts were in the midst of an unprecedented attack on our democracy, an act of cyber warfare against our democratic institution that not only violated our law but subverted our electoral process.  The potentially false statements on this topic by then-Senator Sessions were not only deeply relevant and critically important in their own right, but they leave us with the question: What else is missing or misleading in that testimony, and the consequential questions about his fitness to lead the Department of Justice must be answered.  Unless Attorney General Sessions can provide a credible explanation, his resignation will be necessary. Senator Sessions' false statements heighten my deep concern about credible allegations that the Trump campaign, the transition team, and the administration officials have colluded with the Russian Government, not only in actions prior to the election but possibly since then in what may amount to a coverup. Unless the whole truth is uncovered--and if there is a coverup, truly the adage will be fulfilled that the coverup is as bad as the crime. The only way to deter Russian aggression and continued cyber attacks on our democracy is to uncover the truth and deter this kind of aggression in the future.  At the time of his meetings with the Russian Ambassador, Senator Sessions was chairman of the Trump campaign's National Security Advisory Ambassador Kislyak is, of course, the same individual whose repeated covert contacts with former LTG Michael Flynn, President Trump failed to disclose both to the American public and to his own Vice General Flynn's failure to make those disclosures led to his own termination as National Security  Contacts between these two men would raise concerns under any circumstances, but Senator Sessions' decision to, in effect, conceal them makes them even more troubling. I use that word with regret because I sat in the committee hearing as he answered those questions, and, personally, I can reach no other conclusion than to say he must have intended to conceal them and hide them from us as committee members.  The Attorney General, who is the most important law enforcement official in our country, must be held to an even higher standard. The sudden disclosure that he met repeatedly with the Russian Ambassador after denying under oath any such contact, gives us all the more reason--indeed compelling evidence--that a special counsel is necessary, and necessary now, to investigate Russian ties and contacts with the Trump campaign.  I have called for such a special counsel or prosecutor for weeks now and led a letter with more than 10 of my colleagues asking that Attorney General Sessions designate such a special prosecutor.

3192,topic-id,1568,"Mr.President, I want to talk a few minutes about the challenges so many of our Cabinet members face trying to restore our infrastructure, to maintain our park system, and to create the public-private partnerships the President mentioned earlier this week in his vision for infrastructure reform.  Certainly Governor Perry, whose nomination we are debating right now, will have many opportunities in Energy to do that, in the research components of Energy and the partnership components that can be there.  We just confirmed a new Secretary of Interior, Ryan One of our great assets as a nation is the Federal park system. We are now entering the second hundred years of that Federal park system, and that second hundred years is going to be defined by partnerships in ways the first hundred years weren't.  The park system is a great way to enjoy the blessings we have and the rich geography, the scenic beauty--some of these parks really reflect the great challenges people faced as they settled the country--and also there are historic parks that reflect the history. Sometimes our parks do both of those things.  I think all of my colleagues are aware of the Gateway Arch in Louis, one of the most visited national parks, the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial there celebrating President Jefferson, celebrating the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and really celebrating that long movement as people moved west--eventually really west and really northwest, Mr.President, where you live in But the Gateway Arch is visited often. It opened in 1967, and so now we are 50 years into that particular part of our system. The original park itself needed a lot of restoration, but 50 years later, you look at that park and you look at how it has been used and decide how it could be better used.  What most of my colleagues probably aren't aware of is that right now, it is the biggest investment the National Park Service is making in the system at this moment, trying to connect the Gateway Arch to the Old Courthouse in Louis, the Federal courthouse where the Dred Scott case was tried--they are trying to connect that park to[[Page S1553]]the rest of the city in ways that--when it was built, it was separated by an interstate highway, so you would go see the park, but you wouldn't get to the rest of the national park side there very often.  Rethinking that is important, but what is maybe even more important is this is the biggest park project in the history of the country where private donors provided more of the money than the government did. This is not easily done. If for 100 years you have been doing something one way, it is not easy to immediately begin to say: We are going to do it another way from now on.  If you are in charge, like Secretary Jewell was put in charge of this project--and by the way, I think she has done a good job, as has her regional director, understanding that if you are going to do things differently, they have to be different.  It would be great if the city and private donors--the city even voted a tax just for this project, to provide millions of dollars that the project would be spending. Of course, I think initially the Park Service would think: Isn't that great? We now get this money from private donors, and we now get this money from a city tax, in addition to a portion of the money we are still getting appropriated by the Congress, and we will just spend it the way we have always spent it, as if we had no partners. But that didn't work out very well at all. The partners in the project actually wanted to be partners in the project.  As we look at the next hundred years of this great National Park System, I think we have to understand that for that to work and for that to work in a new way, we have to treat it differently. We are seeing that in We are seeing the three different groups come together in ways that have provided the funding. But, frankly, they also need to be at the table when you talk about how you are going to spend the funding.  We changed the law in Congress just a couple of years ago so that private money, if it is being held by the Federal Government, as it has been on that project, if there is any interest to be earned, if there is any benefit from that money, it also goes to the project rather than going into general revenue.  The goal here would be to do everything we can, if we are going to have a different park system for the next hundred years, to really encourage the next group of people to step up and say: We want to provide--as in the case in Louis, MO--more than half of the money, but we would like to have some input on how that is going to be used and how this is going to meet the needs of the community.  But also everybody who visits there, as they connect with the community uniquely in that Louis park--Missouri has a great park system. I think we are rated as one of the top four park systems in the country, our State system. In fact, right now we are looking at one of those State parks at Genevieve, which was a part of our State that was first settled by French settlers. The number of buildings there dating right back to the turn of the 19th century--1801, 1804--is reflective of how French settlers built buildings, which is different from how other settlers did.  There is a lot to learn about how we come together as a people in so many of our parks, as well. So when Secretary Zinke takes that job, one of the new opportunities is to build on what is already started in places like Louis and figure out how we can have those kinds of partnerships when the President talks about infrastructure expansion and how we are going to look for new ways to do that. As you look at new ways to do that, you have to really be willing to think of how you approach this in a way that encourages partners to be part of it.  Clearly, infrastructure--one of the great benefits of where we are located is where we are located. We have an ocean on two sides. We have a river that runs up the middle of the country, that connects the country in unique ways to all the water travel of the world. We have these coasts on each side that are beneficial to this if we connect ourselves in the right ways.  So the President's view that the road system, the airport system, the port system all need to work in a way that links us up to be better competitors and links us up in a way that allows us to create economic opportunities and better jobs for families is important.  So that kind of partnership, the partnership the park system is in--I think we are seeing the mold established, the model established for how that would work in Louis right now at the In the next couple of years, that project will be completed. It will be different than it was 50 years ago because people want to see things differently than they did 50 years ago.  With Secretary Perry, who should be confirmed today--I think clearly will be confirmed today--his opportunities at Energy to look for partners who add to what we can do there in ways we haven't thought of before--just like we use research money now, take that research money in health research and research money in ag research to bring other people into this discussion that creates opportunities for who we can be.  As we move slowly and in a way that has really made it difficult to take advantage of this new administration, we are apparently going to be able to confirm two nominees to the Cabinet today. But we are still way behind, by any measure, the history of the country in working with a new administration to let them take responsibility. There are going to be 500, 1,000 nominees--I think there are about 1,000 Deputy Secretaries and Under Secretaries who come once we are done with the I hope we can all find a way to get this done, with an understanding that whether or not you agree with the election, the election was held and the new administration has the responsibility for government. It is the job of the Senate and the Senate alone to be sure that those Cabinet officers and the people who support those Cabinet officers and departments are put in place early, as well.  Looking at the park system, looking at partnership, and looking at how important it is that we are willing to do things in a different way is something we ought to be thinking about in this week that we confirm the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Interior, and, later today, the Secretary of  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, which also includes the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research  The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act is a product of hard work and negotiation over the past two I want to thank[[Page H2664]]Congressman Frank Lucas, Chairman Lamar Smith, and former Environment Subcommittee Chairs Jim Bridenstine and Chris Stewart, who were great partners in getting us here today.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible for important work at the cutting edge of science and public service. Weather forecasting is one of the most critical tasks for our country. At a time when budget uncertainty jeopardizes some of the most fundamental services NOAA provides to our Nation, it is imperative that we support legislation like H.353 to give the agency the resources and flexibility needed to fulfill its mission.  The northwest Oregon communities I represent and communities across the country rely on timely and accurate weather forecasts to decide when to harvest their crops, when to go to sea to fish, how to navigate the roads safely when there is freezing rain or snow and to prepare for possible flood conditions.  The National Weather Service provides excellent forecasting products to support our economy, but with the increasing frequency and severity of severe weather events, there can be and should be improvements in our forecasting capabilities and delivery. Improvements in forecasts can provide more lead time to allow communities to prepare, especially in severe weather events. More effective communication of forecast information to the public and those in harm's way can reduce the loss of life and property.  This bill connects the research side of NOAA--the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research--more effectively to the forecasting needs of the National Weather Service, cultivating a research-to-operations pipeline that is essential for the continued improvement of our weather forecasting enterprise. The bill contains several provisions that will improve interactions and information sharing between NOAA's researchers and the National Weather It improves communication between NOAA and the broader research and private weather communities. The bill also formally establishes the pilot program currently operating at NOAA to engage in contracts with the commercial sector for weather forecasting data.  Even the best forecasts will not adequately serve the public's needs unless there are effective communication systems in place. H.353 directs NOAA to do more research, listen to experts, and improve its risk communication techniques.  The bill also establishes interagency coordination through the Office of Science and Technology Policy across multiple agencies outside NOAA that share responsibilities for weather research and forecast communications. This is essential, and it highlights the important role the Office of Science and Technology Policy and NOAA share to help speed the adoption of best tools and practices across the various agencies of the Federal  The legislation before us today also includes the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act, legislation I have introduced over the past three The Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act seeks to improve our country's understanding of the threat posed by tsunami events by improving forecasting and notification systems, developing supportive technologies, and supporting local community outreach preparedness and response plans. This bill helps to address the risk faced by communities on both coasts and in the Gulf of Mexico by improving our mitigation and research program and enhancing community outreach and planning.  Many, if not most, of my colleagues represent districts that have experienced some kind of natural disaster. The threat of a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami is real because of the Cascadia Subduction West Coast Members take this threat very seriously.  I have heard from coastal communities, people who fish, the tourism and maritime industries, marine and public safety officials, sheriffs, emergency managers, small-business owners, older Americans, and students who are concerned that their communities are not prepared for a tsunami.  Students at Seaside High School, a coastal community in my district, engaged in a year-long project to educate Oregonians about the threat a tsunami has on lives and property. Three of the four public schools in Seaside are still located inside the tsunami inundation zone. The high school students have practiced their evacuation route, and they know that, in the projected time between a major earthquake and the devastating wave of a tsunami, they couldn't make it to higher ground. That is unacceptable.  The University of Oregon and Oregon State University are working on seismic warning systems and tsunami preparedness to help make sure that our communities are prepared and have the best research available to give the most warning time possible, and this bill compliments their work.  I am proud to have worked on this legislation which is so important to the people of northwest Oregon and all coastal communities, but I do remain very concerned that the funding level is below current spending. This cut would have serious consequences. The operation and maintenance funding for the buoy network we rely on to detect tsunami could decrease, adding hours of delay in appropriately warning coastal communities.  Tsunami warning centers in Alaska and Hawaii are likely to see a reduction in staff, resulting in gaps in coverage and creating greater risks because of time delays in sending out accurate warnings and, in some instances, not being able to provide adequate warning at all.  Tsunami are among the most deadly natural disasters. In the past two decades, tsunami have caused the deaths of roughly a quarter million people around the world. These disasters also have profound economic consequences. The 2001 tsunami in Japan caused more than $200 billion in economic losses.  We are fortunate, in the United States, to have been spared these catastrophes so far.                              {time}  1445  But our coastlines, from the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, are very susceptible to the same kind of disasters we have seen in Indonesia and in It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.  Tsunami program activities protect coastal Oregonians just as hurricane forecasting protects coastal Floridians, Carolinians, and others up and down the East Coast of the United It is important that we reauthorize these lifesaving activities, and just as important to provide the necessary funding to support them.  I will work tirelessly with my colleagues to make sure this program receives the full funding it needs to serve our communities and save lives and property.

He understands that we need to improve our ability to collect against our adversaries, and Dan will be a forceful advocate for intelligence collection but, again, never jeopardizing that line of what is legal and what is not.  Dan's legislative experience also translates to his understanding and his appreciation of the need for transparency with the appropriate oversight committees and, more importantly, with the Congress and the American people.

The American people deserve for us to do a good job of digging into the backgrounds of the various nominees so that the people know who exactly the President has chosen to run these important government agencies. We are going to continue this process both for Cabinet-level nominees and also those nominated to serve in sub-Cabinet positions.  I am here today to speak about the nominee to serve as Secretary of Energy--Governor Rick Perry of Most people probably remember Governor Perry for his famous quip during a Presidential debate during which he announced he wanted to get rid of three agencies, but could not remember that the Department of Energy was one of them.  So he became famous for forgetting that he wanted to abolish the Department of In some ways, this allowed everyone to focus on exactly how important the Department of Energy is to our The Department's vital missions not only help us with the R&D of the future, but also with our national security. The national laboratories that are overseen by the Department drive our leadership in a global economy. They are based on innovation and play a vital role across the Nation for people who rely on affordable and efficient energy to heat their homes, run their appliances, and connect to the internet.[[Page S1554]]  The Department of Energy safeguards our nuclear arsenal. It also is responsible for cleaning up the waste generated by our nuclear weapons complex facilities that helped us win World War II and the cold war. The Department also plays a key role in protecting our energy infrastructure from cyber attacks. It also makes important contributions to our understanding of climate science, enabling the collection and management of data needed to understand our changing environment and is a major driver of innovation.  Before Mr.Perry was even nominated, the transition team was already targeting Department of Energy climate scientists. The transition team sought a list of those Department employees and contractors that had worked on climate change issues during the Obama This came across as an attempt to try to shut down those climate scientists and target them in a Trump  Silencing scientists is outrageous. We need an Energy Secretary who is not only going to protect the scientists who work at DOE no matter what their responsibility is but who is also going to make sure we use that important data for research and for mitigating the impacts of climate change on our coastal communities and pristine areas. Climate change is already producing significant impacts in the State of Washington and throughout the We need scientists working on this issue to get our States and local governments the best data and information possible.  As I previously mentioned, the Department of Energy is also an important driver of innovation. There is so much happening in the areas of smart buildings and modernizing our grid and resiliency and energy efficiency.  The thing that concerned me most about Governor Perry was his unwillingness to commit wholeheartedly to preserving the Electricity Office and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within the We need these offices and their R&D so that the U.can continue to create jobs in our growing energy economy.  Continued aggressive research and development is necessary if we are going to become more energy efficient and consumers are going to have access to reliable and affordable electricity. We need a Secretary who is going to emphatically push the Trump administration in the proper direction. That is exactly what we wanted to hear from Governor Perry in the Energy committee. Four members of the committee asked about his commitment to these programs. Unfortunately, the nominee dodged the questions. I followed up with Governor Perry after his confirmation hearing, and he still failed to provide a commitment to fight for these important programs. So I regret that I will not be able to support this nominee.  We need to make sure that the United States will continue to support the R&D, the scientists, the investments in electric grid modernization, and the investments in cyber security that are going to help make our Nation safe and our economy strong. I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination, and I hope that we can move forward on making sure that we have an aggressive energy strategy for the future.

3196,topic-id,1882,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague for coming to the floor and for her statement on this important issue. She and I are partners in making sure that Hanford waste is cleaned up. We so much want to continue to make progress on this important issue for our Having dealt[[Page S1555]]with previous Energy Secretaries, we know that it is always a fight to make sure that Hanford gets the priority it deserves, so I thank her for that.  I want to resume my comments about the key functions the Department of Energy performs and why it is vitally important that the agency succeeds in its missions, rather than be dismantled by a President who may not understand the significance of the work the Department does.  I am speaking specifically about the Department of Energy's programs to enhance our energy efficiency, promote renewable energy innovation, mobilize, modernize and bolster the security of our electricity grid, and continue to make significant advancements in science. I have spoken to Governor Perry on a couple of occasions, but, as I mentioned earlier, I failed to hear him commit to these essential DOE programs.  Our Nation's energy sector is undergoing an unbelievable transformation from fossil fuels. These changes are giving consumers more choice and lower energy bills and producing a more robust job-creation environment.  There are now 2.2 million Americans who work in the energy efficiency industry alone. In fact, energy efficiency accounted for 14 percent of all new jobs created in this country last year. That is an incredible number. We need to continue making investments in smart cars and smart buildings and homes of the future and how they are going to be integrated to reduce energy use and lower bills.  We just had a hearing this morning in the Commerce Committee and talked about broadband and white space and the continued development of the mobile economy and how we need to continue to take advantage of those advancements, particularly in rural communities.  The solar power workforce is also growing at a rapid rate. Last year, 1 out of every 50 new jobs in the United States was from solar power. The solar industry now employs more people than the oil and gas extraction or coal mining industries. These are important economic sectors.  In the last administration, the Energy Department's Quadrennial Energy Review estimated that 1.5 million new energy jobs will need to be filled, many of which will be in emerging energy technologies that will help define our clean energy economy. There are approximately 60,000 people in my home State of Washington who are employed in the clean energy sector. In fact, clean energy employment is growing twice as fast as the overall job rate in the State of  We have made too much progress, we have come too far in continuing to advance these important technologies to reverse course now. These advancements are going to help drive more savings and efficiency for consumers and businesses so they can be competitive. We must have leadership at the Department of Energy making sure that progress continues.  I take Governor Perry at his word that he has now been fully briefed and he no longer believes the Department of Energy should be abolished. But his testimony raised questions about whether he will fight to protect the Department's essential programs from ideologues in a Trump administration that want to defund and eliminate these programs.  To better understand these challenges, let's briefly review the history. Just before the President was elected, the transition team's energy group sent a memo outlining 14 energy and environmental initiatives the new administration would be pushing. The memo pointed out that the Trump administration was going to eliminate and rescind and relax several Obama administration initiatives that are important to energy efficiency, important to reducing greenhouse gases, and require agencies to take the costs associated with climate into account. Shortly afterwards, the transition team sent an unprecedented questionnaire to the Energy Department, targeting scientists and civil servants who worked on these issues and asked the Obama administration to identify them.  The morning of Governor Perry's hearing, we awoke to news that the President's team was working on a proposal to eliminate the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of So all those jobs I previously mentioned that are key in my State, key in the United States, and, I guarantee you, key to the U.economy's competitiveness in the future, would be at risk. Driving down the cost of electricity and keeping our businesses competitive is key to our Nation's economic strategy. I know that as a Senator who comes from a State with very affordable electricity. It has built our economy over and over and over and over again.  If you think about how our manufacturers have to compete in a global economy and look at where some of the manufacturing has gone or where our competition exists, these issues of cost-effective and efficient energy are key to our competitiveness as a nation.  We have seen in the State of California unbelievable results from energy efficiency. It is far cheaper to save a kilowatt of energy than it is to produce one, and this key factor is what has made California the leader in our Nation in energy efficiency and helped California businesses to be competitive. So we do not want to eliminate the Office of Energy Efficiency or the Office of  As I said earlier, we tried to get Governor Perry to take a solid stance on these issues and commit wholeheartedly to fighting any attempt to do away with these important offices, but he failed to make a commitment.  During the President's very first hour in office, the administration announced it was going to eliminate the Obama administration's climate action plan. This plan even included a program started by President George H.Bush--the Global Climate Research Initiative to assess and predict the impacts of climate change in the future.  This is not a partisan issue. President George Bush called on Congress to enact energy efficiency legislation, which he subsequently signed into law, and based on bipartisan energy legislation passed in 2005 and 2007, we improved lighting efficiency by 70 percent and increased fuel efficiency standards for automobiles. So I don't understand why the Trump administration is apparently so hostile to energy efficiency.  The Energy Department's energy efficiency programs are expected to save American consumers $2 trillion on their utility bills by 2030 and reduce carbon emissions by 7.3 billion tons over the same period. That is equivalent to taking 1.6 billion cars off the road. The fact that businesses could save $2 trillion by reducing their utility bills in the future is something we should all be passionate about. Our manufacturing base needs to remain competitive.  In addition, the Bush administration worked to get the United States and China--the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters--to work together on clean energy solutions. President Bush also chose in his State of the Union Address to be an advocate for energy efficiency, electric vehicles, biofuels, R&D, and a clean energy economy. I now appreciate even more now how much he advocated for those programs. It seems strange now to see a new Republican administration that seems so single-mindedly against these important energy advancements that are going to help our economy.  The Department of Energy also plays an essential role in protecting the electric grid from cyber and physical attacks. The Office of Electricity plays a very key role for our Nation, and, as we know, there is a full-throated debate about what cyber security attacks can do to the United States of  These issues about how some regime could undermine our U.democracy are critical. We need to address it, and we need to be aggressive as a nation about it.  The Office of Electricity plays a key role, and we want the Department of Energy to be aggressive in asserting its leadership on cyber security. If you are not committed to the Office of Electricity, if you are not committed to these vital programs, how are you going to be committed to protecting us on cyber security?  It should not have been difficult for Governor Perry to speak more urgently about these programs or to say he disagreed with the administration's reported desire to cut them. For instance, he spoke eloquently about energy diversification and pointed us to his record as But, as I looked[[Page S1556]]back at his record, I noticed that he tried to add 11 new coal plants, 8 of which were subsequently canceled after a court overturned his executive order expediting the coal permitting process. This is the kind of leadership we cannot afford at the Department of That is not about holding on to the past; we need a plan for the future.  Finally, I want to mention President Trump's recent Executive order regarding the National Security While it is within the discretion of the President to structure his National Security Council as he sees fit, the Secretary of Energy is a member of the National Security Council by virtue of statute. The President's Executive order removed the Secretary of Energy from the principals committee and what under the Obama administration was called the senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United  I can guarantee you that energy is an issue of national security. We need leadership out of the Department of Energy to be strategic on electricity, transmission, and cyber security.  The Department of Energy's technical expertise is vast and is not limited to the implementation of the Iran deal. The Department plays a key role on nuclear security issues.  I take the Governor at his word that he will come to Hanford, that he will look for funding to make sure that cleanup happens, and I take him at his word that he does want to work with Members of  Unfortunately, his unwillingness to commit to critical offices at the Department that are responsible for important scientific research, giving our government and our communities more data and information about climate science, making the investments we need in our electricity grid of the future, is something that concerns me about his nomination. I cannot support Governor  I know so much will get boiled down to this sound bite of him being the nominee of an agency that he said he wanted to abolish and then, at the same time, could not even remember the agency. I guarantee you, the Energy Department is a vital, functioning program not just for today's energy needs, but as the quadrennial review said, for our future energy needs.  So we could have an Energy Secretary who is going to help us with the transformation, protecting us on cyber security, making sure our businesses reap the benefits of greater energy efficiency, and, when it comes to the electricity grid of the future, making sure we plan for those 1.5 million jobs that are going to be needed. But those aren't the commitments we have had from Governor  I hope my colleagues will recognize that this nomination is not the direction the Department of Energy needs to go in and oppose Governor Perry for the Department of  Madam President, I yield the floor.

3200,topic-id,1007,"Madam President, I will vote against confirming former Texas Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of There are too many policies he promoted while he was governor that cause concern. He refuses to accept scientific consensus regarding human causes of climate change. His support for clean energy and energy efficiency seems tenuous, at best, and he is in lock-step with the Trump administration's desire to boost fossil fuel production at the expense of human health and the environment.  Governor Perry, while campaigning for the Republican nomination for President in 2012, proposed abolishing the agency he has now been nominated to run. I appreciate his candor and honesty in repudiating that position and acknowledging that he really didn't understand the Department of Energy's mission at the time. He has served our Nation and Texas as an Air Force pilot, a member of the Texas House of Representatives, the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, and the Lieutenant Governor and Governor of  A key part of DOE's mission has been to promote clean and advanced energy technologies, via grants for research and development, and through the work of 17 national laboratories. In response to growing global demand for clean energy solutions, DOE under the leadership of Secretaries Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz launched initiatives to expand the global reach of DOE's clean and advanced energy missions.  In 2009, then-Energy Secretary Chu announced that he would host the first Clean Energy Ministerial, CEM, to bring together ministers with responsibility for clean energy technologies from the world's major economies and ministers from a select number of smaller countries that are leading in various areas of clean energy.  The CEM is a high-level global forum to promote policies and programs that advance clean energy technology, to share lessons learned and best practices, and to encourage the transition to a global clean energy economy. Previous CEMs have yielded remarkable national pledges from both the United States and foreign governments to develop and deploy clean energy technologies which in the aggregate have played a significant role in improving the global market competitiveness of clean and renewable energy technologies.  DOE also serves as the linchpin of the U.pledge to Mission Innovation, a global initiative involving 20 nations aimed at doubling public clean energy research and development.  The program, spearheaded by President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande with private sector support from Bill Gates via the Breakthrough Energy The current U.Government investment portfolio of more than $5 billion spans the full range of research and development activities--from basic research to demonstration activities, RD&The U.Government investment portfolio includes programs at 11 agencies, with the largest investment at These programs address a broad suite of low carbon technologies, including end-use energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, electric grid technologies, carbon capture and storage, advanced transportation systems, and fuels.  At DOE, these programs are implemented through a number of mechanisms including cost-shared projects with the private sector research and development activities at the National Laboratories, grants to universities, and support for collaborative research centers targeted to key energy technology frontiers. The next planned phase for Mission Innovation, as envisioned by former Energy Secretary Moniz, was developing an international clean energy consortia, based on the principle of sharing institutional and technological resources to deploy shared energy solutions across international boundaries. The goal was to bring countries of all sizes together to develop, produce, and deploy clean energy solutions, with our 17 National Research Laboratories at the center of this results-oriented partnership.  Unfortunately, all of this investment and America's ability to lead and profit from the clean energy revolution is in jeopardy. There is no credible reason to believe that former Governor Perry or President Trump appreciate the U.interest in growing clean energy research and cooperation. President Trump deliberately ignores the significant growth of solar energy in the U.Human health, the environment, and America's global competitiveness will suffer as a result of this backwards ideological outlook on U.energy research, development, and production.  There were significant investments in wind energy in west Texas while Mr.Perry was Governor, but he also tried to fast-track 11 new coal-fired power plants in the State, a plan the courts ultimately scrapped.  During Mr.Perry's two unsuccessful runs for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016, he consistently recited popular tropes coined by climate change denialists. For instance, in his book, ``Fed Up'' former Governor Perry called the science behind climate change a ``contrived, phony mess.'' During his 2012 campaign, former Governor Perry accused climate scientists of manipulating data in order to receive funding for their projects. While he was Governor, his administration deleted all references to climate change from a report about sea level rise in Galveston  I am also concerned that, during the Perry administration, Texas dropped from 11th down to 27th in the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy's ranking of State energy efficiency policies. Under his watch, Texas filed suit in 2012 challenging the U.Environmental Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases significantly endanger public health.  Under his watch, Texas sued EPA a dozen times between 2008 and 2011.  According to press reports, the Trump administration may eliminate several DOE offices, including the Office of Electricity and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable  Former Governor Perry was asked about these reports during his confirmation hearing but didn't commit to fighting for the offices or the vital programs they administer.  Former Governor Perry was also an active member of the Outer Continental Shelf Governors Coalition, While the OCSGC supports offshore wind development, its primary purpose is to promote oil and gas production on OCS lands, including the mid-Atlantic, and expand revenue sharing for interested So States to the south of Maryland may push for OCS oil and gas production and reap increased benefits from it at the expense of all taxpayers.

But I am greatly concerned about the current state of the organization that General McMaster is being asked to run and that the way in which the President and his senior advisers appear to be running it is creating great risk for our  The President's first National Security Advisor, who lasted less than a month in office, had failed to register as a foreign agent, a job that he held throughout the Presidential campaign and into the transition--so much for America first.  The initial Executive order structuring the National Security Council system for the new administration deliberately omitted the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Director of National Intelligence from the Principals Committee--in other words, a National Security Council without the insight and guidance of our intelligence community or military.  Every administration can structure the White House as it sees fit, but national security without intelligence or military advice is, frankly, mind-boggling.  At the same time, the NSC was to include Steve Bannon, the President's political adviser. Although previous White Houses have had staff from outside the NSC sit in on NSC meetings on occasion and as appropriate, never before has an administration suggested that the NSC's work of safeguarding our Nation be subordinate to the political goals of safeguarding a President's political position and public opinion ratings.  Alongside the NSC, this White House has established a so-called Strategic Initiatives Group under Mr.Bannon, which is reportedly undertaking strategic reviews of U.policy on sensitive issues--including U.S.-Russia relations. Running a shadow NSC with crossing lines of jurisdiction and authority seems like a recipe for disaster.  So all of this has created an environment of dysfunction and an organization in severe distress. It is one thing to run a family real estate company this way, but this is our national security that is at stake.  If there is a crisis tonight--on the Korean Peninsula, with Russia, in the Middle East or Persian Gulf--it is far from clear that the NSC is in a position to provide our senior policymakers with the options they need and the decision-space necessary to safeguard America in a dangerous and unpredictable world.

Those are our friends, our neighbors, our family members who no longer will have health coverage.  In addition, it provides an enormous tax break for the wealthiest people in this country. In fact, the total value of these tax breaks over the decade is $600 billion to the richest individuals and the biggest corporations. It is the largest transfer of wealth for working families to the very rich in our Nation's history.  To accommodate this tax break, to give this huge tax benefit to the richest Americans and the largest corporations, they achieve this by stealing health care from millions of families all across this country and by cutting billions of dollars from Medicaid and As the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) said, the 400 richest families will each enjoy a $7 million tax cut; and the way they paid for that is they take away health care from millions of  There is also the impact on our economy. There is a new analysis from the Center for American Progress, and they conclude that TrumpCare will destroy 1.8 million jobs.  We are all focused on: How do we get people back to work? How do we create good-paying jobs?  This is a job killer. TrumpCare will cost 1.8 million jobs, a loss of an ability to provide for yourself, for your family, and for your future.  As you said, people will be paying more money for less quality care. Deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses will skyrocket, leaving sick people unable to afford the care they need.  Particularly, as you mentioned, there will be an age tax because older Americans will pay more. Their premiums will go up at an even faster pace because they are allowed to charge even more based on their age.  Young people are also hurt. Young people are hit with a millennial tax. They put a 30 percent premium surcharge on those reenrolling after a lapse in coverage, which is often the case, particularly with young people where people may have lost a job and be out of work. So they are going to be penalized with a 30 percent premium.  The impact of the Republican proposal, this TrumpCare proposal, on women is devastating. In addition to new restrictions on comprehensive health care for women, this Republican bill, TrumpCare, defunds Planned Parenthood and will make it much more difficult for women to access essential preventative care and affordable contraception.  As I mentioned, the middle-aged American--the age tax--will pay more. For example, a 64-year-old individual with an income of $26,000 in the individual market will pay $12,900 more in their premiums each year. That is almost half their income under the Republican plan. So it is going to really get those who are above 55 but haven't yet hit the age to receive Medicare especially hard.  Also, TrumpCare hurts our seniors by weakening Medicaid and It shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years. It steals $880 billion from Medicaid, which, as you mentioned, is the principal source of long-term care for seniors.  Also, it does damage to the protection for people who have preexisting conditions, because someone who has a lapse in coverage will be subjected to a 30 percent premium on top of their base premium. So there is another penalty for people who have preexisting conditions.  If you take all of this together, it is worse coverage, worse care, higher costs, huge tax cut for the richest people in this country--for drug companies, for insurance companies, To pay for their tax cut, we take away insurance from the most vulnerable and working people in this country.  We have all received both emails and phone calls and had conversations with those whom we have the privilege of representing, and they have shared with us these heart-wrenching stories of what it would mean to lose their health care.  In my State, I am proud to say that, with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, we have the highest rate of coverage that we have ever had in our State's history. Ninety-seven percent of Rhode Islanders have access to quality, affordable health care. It is great. It makes a difference in the lives and quality of the lives of everyone.  I want to share with the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) an email that I got from a constituent, just recently, from Lincoln, Rhode Brenda said:       If all goes well, I am literally going into surgery for hip      replacement on March 16 of this year. Though hip replacement      is seen as elective, the pain I deal with now interferes with      my quality of life. Without it, I will end up in a wheelchair      in a few years once I can't handle the persistent pain.       Without the ACA, I would not be able to have this      operation. I do not own a home for collateral and have a 19-     year-old car. I work full-time in a hotel for $12 an hour. I      have not had a raise in 4 years. We have no benefits at all,      including health care. We have no paid time off at all for      sick days, personal days, or vacation.       I am not confident enough to move to another job with my      current physical limitations, which have reached a point      where it interferes with every activity, including sleeping.       My doctors, who are aware that I get my medical through the      ACA, have been helpful and diligent about getting me in soon,      knowing there is a major threat for those whose only way for      medical coverage is through the My condition may not be      life-threatening, but left untreated, it would limit where I      can live, if and where I can work, and, most likely, leave me      on permanent disability or Social Security, which most people      can't live on.       I am only 52. I still have several functional, productive      years ahead of me, and I receive a subsidy to help make my      coverage affordable.  Brenda is just one example of someone whose life is literally being preserved. Her quality of life is being protected because she has access to health care. She can have the surgery she needs. She can eliminate the pain she is suffering and lead a productive life.  There are millions and millions of Americans who have the same kinds of stories, who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act, who will be deeply harmed when that insurance is ripped away if Republicans get their way and pass  I want to end by just saying thank you again to the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) and to also mention that he referenced, in his remarks, the process that has produced this very, very troubling piece of legislation, unlike the process that produced the Affordable Care Act that occurred over many, many months and many hearings, where 121 Republican amendments were accepted into the bill and it still didn't earn a single Republican vote. Yet, through TrumpCare, over 100 Democratic amendments were offered in three committees of jurisdiction and not a single Democratic amendment was accepted.[[Page H2283]]  So even efforts to try to improve a terrible bill were rejected in the committee process, and that is because they are intent on making sure they deliver this big tax cut to the special interests who sent them here to Washington, and they are going to try to do it on the backs of the hardworking people of this country. We have to continue to stand up and fight and do everything we can to prevent it from happening.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2280.txt,2055,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,21.0,January
3156,topic-id,310,"Mr.Speaker, there are so many people that I have heard from in my own district, and I know colleagues have heard the same thing when we talk about these numbers: 24 million people will lose their insurance and billions of dollars in tax breaks for the richest people in this country. Behind every one of these numbers is a real person whose life will be destroyed or devastated because they don't have access to quality, affordable health care.  This is the richest, most powerful country in the world. We are well on the way to having a system in which everyone can afford and have access to quality, affordable health care. We made huge progress in the Affordable Care It is not perfect. We have always been willing to say: How do we make it better? How do we build on the success of it?  The notion, in the midst of this progress, that we would deprive or pass a piece of legislation, this TrumpCare, that will take away insurance from 24 million people, that will raise premiums, raise out-of-pocket costs, undermine Medicaid and Medicare, and also give a big tax cut to the richest people in this country is just so wrong.                              {time}  1800  I just think it is very important, as we speak about this, to remember, behind every one of these numbers is a story of a real person, a real family, just like the woman you described, just like Brenda in Lincoln, Rhode Island, whose lives are going to be really hurt and who are going to face devastating consequences because they don't have access to basic quality health care, which is a right in this country every American should have access to.

But today commemorates the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence, when Texas declared itself a republic and independent from the Nation of  Here in the Senate, we remember the sacrifice of those who came before us and laid the foundation for our State by reading a letter written by William Barret Travis, a defender of the That tradition goes back to 1961, when then-Senator John Tower started that tradition. I am told my colleague Senator Cruz will read that letter in full later today, perhaps around 12:30, carrying on this great tradition. So today I wish to express my gratitude for these Texas patriots, many of whom would later serve in the U.Congress, including Sam Houston, whose Senate seat I am honored to now occupy.  Sam Houston came from his farm outside Huntsville, TX, in 1846. It took[[Page S1551]]him about 3 weeks to get to Washington, Of course, he didn't have a modern mode of transportation, but I always marvel at the fact that it now takes me about 3 hours to get home, where it took old Sam 3 weeks just to make a one-way trip.                           U.S.-Mexico Border  Mr.President, on another matter, last week I had the great privilege of hosting a number of my congressional colleagues at the Texas border. At a time when so many people are talking about the border of the United States and Mexico, I thought it was important to bring colleagues who were willing to come to learn and listen about the impact of trade, border security, and our relationship with Mexico on my State and on the United Of course, this border is so important on all of those issues--security, trade, the economy. It is important to see where they intersect. I am glad they had a chance to come to listen and learn last week.  We did receive a number of very important and useful briefings from Customs officials, Border Patrol agents, and other Federal partners in three major areas along the border, including the Rio Grande We were in McAllen, TX, Laredo, and Del I think what my colleagues discovered--if they didn't already know it--is how varied each part of the border is. This is not just true in It is true in San It is true in It is true in New When anybody suggests that we can attain a goal that we all share, which is border security, by just one solution, I think it is important to examine that conclusion and to test it because, frankly, I think what the Border Patrol will tell you is that what we need is infrastructure, yes. We need technology, yes. Then we need people.  That is the formula--personnel, technology, and infrastructure. In my own view, border security is a question of political will. The previous administration did not have that political will. I believe this administration does, and it has been long overdue. I welcome that.  We are going to be working with our State and local officials to make sure that they have the resources they need in order to get the job done. At the same time, I think what we were able to demonstrate to some of our friends from out of State is that we have an important trading relationship with As a matter of fact, 5 million American jobs depend on binational trade with  We went to one of the largest land ports in the country. I think, maybe, it is the largest port of the country--Laredo, TX--where some 15,000 trucks enter the United States every day. It is a huge influx of cargo and, fortunately, businesses all up and down and along the border have worked with the law enforcement agencies, with Customs and Border Protection to make sure that we can expedite the flow of legal trade into the United At the same time, we police for the entry of illegal drugs and for people illegally entering the United States without proper authority.  One reason why my State has done pretty well relative to the rest of the country in terms of our economy is because of our business-friendly attitude. We believe in lower taxes, reasonable regulation, and a welcoming attitude when it comes to people who make investments and who want to come to our State and start businesses or grow businesses.  We all know that roughly 70 percent of job growth in this country comes not from the Fortune 500 companies but from those small and medium-sized businesses. We work very hard to be a business-friendly Why? It is not just because we care about businesses but because we care about the workers who work at those employers.  As one of my former colleagues likes to say, you can't claim to be worker-friendly if you are hostile to the businesses that employ them. That is an inconsistent approach. You need to be consistent.  In addition to the issue of illegal entry into the United States by individuals who come without regard to our immigration laws, we also have a tremendous influx of illegal drugs into the United I think one of the things I was reminded of that we all should be cognizant of is that when we focus on the illegal drug activity in Mexico, Central America, or South America, we need to look in the mirror as a nation because the only way those cartels exist and make the money they make and commit the mayhem and violence they commit is because of demand in the United  I was very encouraged to hear Secretary John Kelly--former Marine John He is still a marine, always a marine, but now he has taken off the uniform and assumed the responsibility of Secretary of the Department of Homeland He previously served as the commanding general in the Southern Command, as the Presiding Officer knows, which covers the combatant command from south of Mexico down to Central America and South So he is very familiar with the region. He made the point, before his confirmation hearing, that there is one thing he would like to see the United States do--effect a major societal and cultural change to deal with the demand for illegal drugs, which fuels all of the cartels and the transnational criminal organizations which plague our security situation along the border and in our neighbors to the south.  I want to say that I am appreciative of our colleagues who joined us on the trip--Senators Tillis and Heller, Congressman Rouzer from North Carolina, and my colleagues from Texas, Congressmen John Carter and Mike  I also wanted to say how much I appreciate Speaker Ryan coming to Texas and the Rio Grande Valley last Wednesday for, unfortunately, a short period of time, but we are all grateful that he came at all--I think, at the invitation of people like Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the House of I think it is going to take all of our efforts working together to effect and implement the President's vision of border security, a goal we all share.  I think what we all were reminded of is that it is more complex than some people assume, and it is going to take a combination of approaches, including personnel. We need to plus-up the Border Patrol because it doesn't do you any good if you identify somebody illegally bringing a shipment of drugs or illegally entering the United States if you don't have a Border Patrol agent to stop them. Also, the very useful border infrastructure--fencing and walls, for example, in the Hidalgo County area--were actually implemented as a way to improve their levee system when the Rio Grande river floods. They have actually created a dual-use structure that actually satisfies the Border Patrol's need for physical infrastructure along with levee improvements in a win-win situation.  I believe that consulting with local officials and local stakeholders, we at the Federal level can come up with more of those win-win solutions. The point is that we have learned a lot, particularly in our military, about how to use technology to keep us safe--whether it is unmanned aerial vehicles or ground sensors or radars. Actually, they have several new aerostats, or balloons, up in the sky that are basically the eyes in the sky, or radar, which do a tremendous job helping to identify people illegally entering the United States and equipping the Border Patrol and law enforcement authorities with the sort of early notice they need in order to interdict people illegally entering the country.  I will close by saying that one of the always surprising things I learn when I go to the Rio Grande Valley and talk to the Border Patrol is this. I ask them: How many different countries are represented by the people whom you detain illegally entering the United States? Obviously, the majority of them come from our neighbors to the south, not as much from Mexico as you might suspect anymore, because the Mexican economy is doing better and people are finding more opportunities there. But right now, the majority of the flow of people illegally entering the United States is from Central  Unfortunately, the tragic situation there where mothers and fathers worry about their children--whether they are going to be killed by gangs or whether they are going to be forced to join gangs--and somehow make the very painful and difficult choice of turning their children over to human smugglers to try to make their way up the backbone of Mexico and into the[[Page S1552]]United States, to be deposited on our doorstop in the United  Last week when the congressional delegation was in McAllen, we went through the processing area where some of these immigrants from Central America were being processed. I asked a young boy there, who was in the process of being processed--through my regional director, because he spoke only Spanish--how old he was, and he said he was 6 years old. He wasn't unaccompanied in that trip from Central America, but his mother and father thought it was important enough to get him out of that ravaged part of the world, where the prospects are not very good, and to turn him over to a human smuggler to make his way up into the United States, only to find himself at a Border Patrol processing unit in McAllen,  My point is that I also met a young man from India, and I asked him: How much did it cost you to get to the United States from India?  He said: About $6,000.  I said: How did you get here?  He said: I took a plane from  He went through Moscow, he said, and ended up in Central America, where he worked his way up with the help of human smugglers into the United  I mention that only to point out that we have a vulnerability there where anybody determined enough or with enough money can find their way into the United We generally assume these people are economic migrants--in other words, looking for opportunity. We all understand that. Those same vulnerabilities create potential danger for our Nation and our local communities when people with unknown motives exploit those same vulnerabilities to come into the United  The last point I will make, again, to emphasize the global nature of illegal immigration into the United States is this. We saw that the Border Patrol has several rescue beacons in Brooks County, This is about 70 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. What happens is that the human smugglers will transport people into the United States and across the river. They will put them in stash houses, really in terrible conditions. As a matter of fact, we went to one of these stash houses. They found 18 migrants in the stash house waiting to be transported up the highway into the heartland of  One of the checkpoints there is at Falfurrias, about 70 miles away from the border. What happens is that the smugglers will have people packed into a van or some vehicle, and before they get to the checkpoint, they will tell the immigrants to get out. If it is hot, they will give them a gallon jug--a milk jug--full of water and they will say: I will see you on the other side. They go around the checkpoint, out through the very difficult ranchland, and meet up on the north side, and then are transported off.  In Brooks County, TX, we went by a cemetery where a number of unknown and unnamed migrants have been buried because they have died due to exposure. Some of these immigrants coming from Central America come up through You can imagine the conditions they have been exposed to, and in the heat of the summer, they have been kicked out of a car and told ``meet us on the north side,'' with a gallon jug of water, and some of them don't make it. Of course the smugglers don't care about people. You are just a commodity. You are just a paycheck. So they will leave stragglers behind. Many of the ranchers said they found as many as 100 different dead bodies on their property over an unspecified period of time.  But there is a rescue beacon that the Border Patrol has down there that is in three languages. It is in English, Spanish, and You might ask, why in the world would you need Chinese written on a rescue beacon where somebody thinks ``OK, I am not going to make it; I need help'' and goes and presses the button on the rescue beacon--that you need English, Spanish, and Well, because they have had Chinese immigrants come through that border region, as well, like the young man from India whom I mentioned earlier. And we have had people from Cuba and from literally all around the world, including some nations that are hosts to terrorist organizations.  This is not only an economic situation. This is not only a law enforcement problem when it comes to drug interdiction. It is a humanitarian crisis, as well. But it is also a national security issue, I think all the leaders of the intelligence community will concede, given the fact that people from 60 different countries have been detained coming across the southwestern border just in the last year by the McAllen sector of the Border  We have a lot of work to do. I hope we will be able to work with the President and this administration and in a bipartisan way to come up with the tools we need in order to secure our border. We need to enforce our immigration laws. Of course, 40 percent of illegal immigration in this country occurs not from people entering the country illegally, it is from people entering legally and overstaying their visa. We may not catch up with them until they commit a serious crime and they are arrested by local law enforcement. I think this is what causes so many people to be angry at the Federal Government for not enforcing our laws. And many of our colleagues, me included, would like to do more to fix our broken immigration system generally, but until we regain the public's confidence that we are actually serious about securing our border and enforcing our laws, I don't believe we can have that conversation. I don't believe we are going to be successful, which I would like to see us be.  I think the first thing we need to do is to work with the administration in order to accomplish the goal of securing the border. Again, in the matter of political will, we know how to do it. We just need to have the desire to get it done. And then once we have regained the public's confidence that the Federal Government is once again living up to its responsibilities, then I think we can have that more expansive conversation about what our immigration system should look like.

3275,topic-id,1220,"Mr.President, I thank my friend, the Senator from Virginia, who is the vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, for his remarks.  I, too, support the nomination of Dan Coats to serve as the next Director of National Intelligence and succeed James Clapper, who has been in the intelligence business for 50-plus years. He has big shoes to fill, but I have every confidence Dan Coats can do that.  One of the things I hope he looks at is that post-9/11, when the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created, we basically created another layer in the intelligence community. As the Presiding Officer and other Members know, the DNI--the Office of the Director of National Intelligence--has grown by leaps and bounds. I just hope he takes a good, hard look at the layers we have created, perhaps at the duplicative functions that do not necessarily make our intelligence any better but that do create more problems in managing what is a very important office to our national security and certainly to the intelligence community.                             Sunshine Week  Mr.President, on another matter, in spite of the snow yesterday, I recognize the fact that this is Sunshine Sunshine Week is a movement that was created to highlight the need for more transparent and open government. Justice Brandeis is also often quoted when one talks about transparency in government and its importance to a functioning democracy when he said that sunlight is the best disinfectant.  As a conservative, I would much rather have people change their behavior in their knowing that their actions are going to be public rather than to pass new laws and new regulations. To me, knowing that the public is going to be aware of what one is doing causes people, typically, to be on their best behavior. I think that is the reason I support Justice Brandeis' comment that sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe that is true.  I have done my best to keep that sentiment in mind to create legislation that presses our democracy toward more openness in the Federal Government, not less. That is because I believe our country grows stronger when operating under the principle that an open government is the basic requirement for a healthy democracy. Of course, when voters know and understand what their government is doing, they are in the best position to change its direction if they disagree with it or to reaffirm that direction by casting their votes as informed members of the electorate.  Democracy can only work when the public knows what government is doing and can hold it accountable, so I am glad that at this time of year, we can look back at the successful efforts we have made to promote transparency while looking ahead to do more.  Last Congress, I introduced the Freedom of Information Act Improvement It is a law that strengthens the existing Freedom of Information Act, which is the country's chief open government law, by requiring Federal agencies to operate under a presumption of openness when considering whether to release government information in their custody.  We passed it last summer, and President Obama signed it into law. This important new law accomplishes some of the most sweeping and meaningful reforms in its history to the Freedom of Information Act, and it is already making a direct impact by helping the public access more information.  Because of the Freedom of Information Act Improvement Act, last October, the CIA released a portion of its official history of the Bay of Pigs invasion, which has been kept classified for decades. This is a critical part of our Nation's history that is worth knowing, and I believe it is no longer necessary to keep it under wraps in order to protect America's national security.  This serves as an example of what we are trying to accomplish with this law and others like it so as to build upon the idea the Founding Fathers recognized hundreds of years ago; that a truly democratic system depends on an informed citizenry to hold its leaders accountable. That is an idea everyone in this Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, can agree upon.  I am thankful to the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr.Leahy, for working with me on the Freedom of Information Act Improvement Act and making it a priority. As a matter of fact, Senator Leahy has been my partner on a number of our efforts in this important area over the years that we have both been in the  I also appreciate Chairman Grassley's leadership, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for stewarding this bill through the committee, and I appreciate Leader McConnell for making sure this was a priority for this  In looking ahead, I will continue working with Chairman Grassley to make sure the Federal agencies are implementing this law in a timely manner, and I look forward to doing more to strengthen greater government transparency measures in the future.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Finally, Mr.President, next week, the Judiciary Committee will take up the nomination of Neil Gorsuch for the U.Supreme Court so he may fill the seat that was vacated by the death of Justice That process, of course, begins with hearings to consider his qualifications and his credentials, but heading into next week, we already know a lot about his record.  He has been praised by people across the political spectrum--from liberals to conservatives--as a highly qualified and exceptional judge with impeccable integrity. He served with great distinction on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, based out of Denver, for the last 10 years, after having been confirmed by this Chamber unanimously. His hometown newspaper, the Denver Post, encouraged the President to nominate Judge Gorsuch before his nomination was even announced. This, of course, was the same newspaper that endorsed Hillary Clinton for Clearly, Judge Gorsuch has won the respect of those across the political spectrum and on both sides of the aisle. Last week, the American Bar Association announced its unanimous decision to grant Judge Gorsuch the highest rating available; that of ``well qualified'' as a nominee to serve on the Supreme Court of the United  I should point out that both the minority leader and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee--the senior Senator from Vermont--have called the American Bar Association's rating system the ``gold standard'' when it comes to assessing the qualifications of judicial nominees.  Judge Gorsuch will also bring decades of experience on the bench, as I mentioned a moment ago. He has also served in private practice, as an attorney with the Justice Department, and, of course, as a Federal judge.  It is time to move forward with the President's nominee to fill the seat that was left open by the death of the late Justice Scalia, and I believe Judge Gorsuch is just the man to fill it. I look forward to hearing from him next week as we consider his nomination to this important position.  I express my gratitude to Chairman Grassley and the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, for their efforts thus far in putting these hearings together, and I look forward to working with the rest of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to consider the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, starting next Monday, March 20.

3333,topic-id,1767,"Mr.President, today the Senate Finance Committee has considered the nomination of Mr.Robert Lighthizer to be the country's next Trade This position serves as a vital role in our country's economic policy by negotiating trade agreements on behalf of the American people and making sure they are enforced according to their terms.  President Trump has made clear that his administration will be devoted to getting the very best trade deals possible for the American people. For Texas, my State--the Nation's top exporting State--trade is incredibly important. Many of our jobs and industries rely on trade agreements, like NAFTA, so that our goods and services can find new markets and more customers. As a matter of fact, 5 million American jobs depend on binational trade with Mexico alone, which gives us a sense of how important trade is to our economy at large.  I am happy to support Mr.Lighthizer for this important post. He has served in the Senate as a staffer on the Senate Finance Committee for the former chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bob Dole, and as the Deputy U.Trade Representative during the Reagan administration as well. In his nearly three decades in the private sector, Mr.Lighthizer has represented a number of U.commercial interests through trade enforcement cases, while also focusing on opening up foreign markets to American ranchers, farmers, and small businesses. I look forward to working with him to improve existing trade deals and to cut better ones for the benefit of the American people.                        American Health Care Act  Mr.President, last week the House of Representatives unveiled a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare with one that provides more options for the American people at a price they can afford. This was in direct response to what has been an ObamaCare disaster--one that led to skyrocketing healthcare costs, insurers leaving markets left and right, and a big government solution to a complicated problem that fails to actually deliver on its promises.  We have all heard it a hundred times if we have heard it once. President Obama said: If you like your policy, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; and a family of four would see a decrease in their premium costs by $2,500. Obviously, that did not prove to be the case.  There is really no denying that ObamaCare isn't working, and the status quo is unacceptable. Under ObamaCare, tens of millions are uninsured--almost 30 million people now in America, which, to me, is one of the most supreme ironies of It was sold to us on the premise that everyone would have insurance. Yet 30 million people are uninsured, and 20 million of those 30 million are either people who have paid a penalty because they haven't bought the government-[[Page S1795]]approved healthcare and thus are not complying with the individual mandate or they are people who claimed a hardship exemption, saying they simply can't afford to buy the policy that the government mandates they purchase, so the government has supplied them an exemption. So 30 million are uninsured under ObamaCare, and 20 million of those 30 million have either paid the penalty or have been otherwise excused from complying with the mandate.  We know that under ObamaCare, tens of millions are uninsured, premiums have skyrocketed, and mandates have crushed job creators.  I remember several conversations with employers--restaurant owners and one gentleman in an architectural firm--saying: When does the employer mandate kick in? In other words, when do you get penalized for not complying with the ObamaCare requirements?  He said: I am going to hire fewer people because I don't want to come within the ambit of that employer mandate.  Then I remember one restaurant in East Texas where a single mom basically was laid off of her full-time job and forced to work two part-time jobs to make up for that lost pay because her employer couldn't comply with the employer mandate under ObamaCare, so what he decided to do was lay off his full-time workers and hire people on a part-time basis. ObamaCare is riddled with stories like that, which demonstrate its flaws.  Consider that a 24-year-old individual in Texas could spend up to 30 percent of their gross income just paying for their healthcare premiums and their out-of-pocket costs--hardly affordable healthcare. We really should have called it the un-Affordable Care We have begun the first step to repeal and replace it.  Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office offered us a glimpse into the impact the legislation would have. But I hasten to add that this is just the first step out of multiple steps, and there is additional work to be done, first of all, by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has enormous discretion in terms of how to administer healthcare policy at the national level and the authority to delegate a lot of that responsibility, along with the money that goes with it, back to the States where it historically has been done, to offer people lower cost health insurance that suits their needs--not a government mandate--and offers them more choices.  There is a number of additional things in the Congressional Budget Office report yesterday which are important to consider.  First, the CBO estimates the American Health Care Act would lower premiums by 10 percent over time. We know ObamaCare raised premiums for many families across the country; they skyrocketed to an unaffordable level. So this is a start in the right direction, but I hasten again to add that it is just a start.  The Congressional Budget Office also confirmed that the American Health Care Act is a fiscally conservative bill that puts forward responsible solutions to our Nation's healthcare woes. CBO estimates that we could reduce the Federal deficit by $337 billion by passing the American Health Care  It also reforms Many of our most vulnerable population get their healthcare through This bill provides a way of sending that money and authority back to the States and lets them manage the growth of the Medicaid Program according to a Consumer Price So people who are on Medicaid now, including those in the expansion States, can stay on Medicaid, but ultimately the responsibility is going to be sent back to the States, along with the money to pay for it, and grow--not to cut it, but to grow--according to a Consumer Price Index, which makes sense. That change alone saves taxpayers another $880 billion--$880 billion. This is the most significant entitlement reform in certainly a generation.  The bill repeals ObamaCare's job-killing taxes like the individual employer mandate and the medical device tax, which has moved jobs offshore to places like Costa Rica because of its impact on innovation. We also repeal the payroll tax, the tax on investments, and the tax on prescription drugs. The fact is, middle-income Americans and our job creators will find massive tax relief as a result of this legislation--to the tune of more than $800 billion.  Put simply, the American Health Care Act dismantles, repeals, and stops ObamaCare in its tracks.  I should point out that the CBO doesn't take into account other steps Congress and the administration will take in order to make our Nation's healthcare system a vibrant marketplace where more options and better quality healthcare exist.  I might say that a lot of the news yesterday on the CBO report had to do with the reduction in the number of people who would actually buy health insurance under this new legislation, but the reason for the change is in large part, as the Congressional Budget Office said, that when you don't punish people through a penalty for not buying government-approved health insurance, as ObamaCare did, people may well decide in their own economic self-interest not to purchase that government policy, particularly when their choices are so limited.  I believe this is a first step in unraveling this convoluted puzzle called ObamaCare and getting our Nation's healthcare back on track. The American people have demanded better than Families are forced to pay for insurance they can't afford that provides subpar care, and they are tired of being forced to pay a penalty because they don't want to opt into a government program that fails to deliver on its most basic promises.  Let me just say this in closing: I know some of our friends across the aisle have a dim view of this proposal. They say the CBO score demonstrates that not enough people will be covered by this alternative to But my question to them is, What are you going to do about the current meltdown in ObamaCare that is forcing people into insurance they don't want and denying them any real choice, where the premiums are skyrocketing, and where the deductibles are so high you are effectively denied the benefit of any health insurance coverage? What are they going to do about that? I would simply say that if they don't like the alternative we have offered, I invite them to join us in trying to solve this problem.  One of the lessons of ObamaCare is that partisan healthcare legislation isn't very durable and doesn't survive. I hope at some point the fever will break, and Democrats and Republicans alike will find a way to work in the best interests of our constituents, the people we serve--the American people.  We can't afford another one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare. The American Health Care Act will provide the first important steps of relief from this unworkable, unsustainable system that was created based on false promises made to the American people. At the end of the day, our goal is to deliver more access, more options, and better quality care for families across the country. I look forward to getting it done soon.  In the House, the Budget Committee will take up the healthcare bill, which passed the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, and then it will move to the floor of the House where I presume it will be open to some amendments. Then it will come to the Senate where, under the Senate rules, it will also be open to amendments.  If people have a better idea, I hope they will join us in trying to come up with the very best solutions possible. But to simply hang back and sort of enjoy the difficulty of trying to reform this broken ObamaCare system for partisan reasons, to me, seems to be beneath the dignity of what we are sent here to do by our constituents.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from Rhode  ",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,1692,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,14.0,April

It is cut in half.  I have a marvelous, wonderful district that I take great pride in representing. It is one of the largest agricultural areas in the country. It has significant wealth, but, sadly, it has significant poverty. It is the combination of those two that make it a place where immigrants have come for decades--immigrants past and immigrants present--to make a better life for themselves.  Mr.Speaker, 19,000 individuals in my district have received financial assistance and have been able to purchase coverage through the Covered California marketplace, and 121,000 individuals in my district are now covered by the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.  The cuts that are proposed in this Republican proposal would devastate those individuals not only in my district, but in Congressman Garamendi's district and throughout the valley. My Republican colleagues, the five of us from Modesto down to Bakersfield, almost 500,000 people today have insurance coverage that did not have it 6 years ago.  Let me give you some real examples. Tom lives in Fresno, He is 57 years old. In 2015, due to a major heart attack, he had to leave his job of 29 years. Tom's health insurance, though, did not lapse because, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, he gained affordable health coverage insurance through the Covered California marketplace. In addition, his family wrote to my office saying that they cannot envision his recovery being a success had it not been for the  Another one of my constituents, John, who lives in Fresno, told my office that without the ACA, he and his wife would not have been able to afford cancer surgery for his wife. She is now cancer-free. And we know how expensive that can be.  Austin, one of those Americans who volunteered to serve his Nation, a Vietnam veteran who lives in my district, told my office that his wife was paying $830 a month before the Affordable Care Now she can afford health care at $400 a month--cut in half.  Not every story with the ACA is a success story. It is not perfect. There are problems with the act. We should be working on it.  I remember, Congressman Garamendi, when you were the insurance commissioner of California, and one of the areas that you developed a lot of expertise and experience on was how to deal with the insurance industry. Certainly there are improvements that can be made. There are small-business owners in my district who say that the ACA raises costs and does not provide enough insurance options for themselves or their employees. So we need to work together to fix the provisions in the law that drive up the costs and weaken the insurance marketplace.  This month, the American Health Care Act was introduced to repeal and replace the ACA by our Republican colleagues. I do not believe the American Health Care Act is a serious solution to fixing the problems we have in the The legislation we know would provide less financial help to low-income families and seniors whom we both represent. The American Health Care Act would dramatically change the way we finance Medicaid by shifting from an open-ended reimbursement system to a person allotment or block grant which will cap the amount of money in California that receive Medicaid, and that is dramatic and devastating.  This would force California to choose how to allocate increasingly a smaller number of Medicaid dollars and would decrease the care available to Medicaid beneficiaries which Congressman Garamendi and I care deeply about. Thousands of individuals in the San Joaquin Valley would be impacted.  Additionally, the legislation will not mandate individuals to purchase health insurance. Instead, insurers would be able to attach a 30 percent surcharge--think about that--on individuals who have a lapse in coverage. I don't think that is going to play well in Peoria or in So this will provide a disincentive for young and healthy people to buy insurance. It is important to note that in order for the insurance marketplace to work, there needs to be healthy people in the system to help pay for sick people. When the Speaker said that healthy people are subsidizing sick people, well, I am not an insurance expert, but isn't that the way insurance works? Good drivers pay for poor drivers, right? If you don't have a pool, a balanced pool, it doesn't work.  One last point I want to make: passing the Affordable Care Act, I was here in 2010, and it wasn't pretty. It took 1 year, dozens of committee hearings in several committees, multiple versions of the bill in the House and the Senate, and various revisions of it. We tried to get the Republicans involved. We tried to get them to participate, and we took amendments that they gave. But at some point, they decided that, no, they were going to go it alone or force us to go it alone. I think they are making the same mistake that possibly we made 6 years ago. I think that is sad because I think the American public wants us to work together.  Less than 1 month after introducing their repeal-and-replace bill, which will be before us this week--and, clearly, the replace is still a work in progress--the House is going to pass a bill on a party line vote on Thursday maybe without an updated CBO score. I thought we were going to have transparency, the light of day, know what taxpayers are paying, what they are getting, and what they are not getting. I guess not on The CBO scores are how Congress and the public analyzes how legislation would impact States and citizens. But we are not working to get that vital information.  This last week I hosted a healthcare workshop to hear from all of my hospitals, healthcare providers, clinics, doctors, and nurses to ask what they thought of the Affordable Care Act and what we can do to fix the law. What they told me is there are a lot of things we can do to fix the current law to make it better. But they said the healthcare act that is being offered as a repeal and replace is not a solution to providing the much-needed health care we need in the San Joaquin Valley, that we need in California, and that we need in our country.  At the end of the day, Mr.Speaker, we know that working together is how you get things done. On a bipartisan basis, we can make a difference, but not the way we are going. So I think that the gentleman from California's efforts and my efforts as we continue to try to urge common sense to prevail is what we need to do. I will, unfortunately, not be able to vote for this measure on Thursday because it really[[Page H2286]]is going to negatively impact hundreds and thousands of people in the San Joaquin Valley that will lose their coverage as a result of this repeal and replace.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his passion and his efforts.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2280.txt,1774,MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS ALLOWABLE USE ACT,2017.0,21.0,April
3138,topic-id,707,"Mr.Speaker, there is no better sign of a healthy economy than a healthy real estate market. We know this in this country from bitter experience since the real estate and financial collapse of 2008.  In my State in Connecticut, we are barely at a place now where home sales and home equity has even come in a positive direction and climbing back towards what existed back in 2008 when the collapse occurred.  Listening to the President's speech on Friday where he very powerfully talked about the forgotten American, middle class individuals and working people who really felt that they were left behind in terms of the work that happens in this city, he clearly touched a nerve that propelled him to the White As I said, it was probably the most powerful part of his message that he delivered on  I mention that because it was astonishing that within an hour after taking the oath, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back a rate reduction for mortgage insurance for homeowners. What that means is that for many homeowners--particularly first-time home buyers--they need to have mortgage insurance in order to qualify for a mortgage. That ensures that if there is a default, that the mortgage will be paid off. It de-risks the loan so that, again, particularly people who are first-time home buyers can actually buy a house. The Federal Housing Administration, FHA, runs this mortgage insurance program.  Again, there was a rate reduction that was slated to go into effect on January 27, from 0.85 percent down to 0.6 percent. President Trump canceled that reduction.  So what does that mean?  The National Association of Realtors, which is hardly a partisan group, has, in the wake of that order, released numbers that about 750,000 to 800,000 homeowners are going to be adversely affected by losing those savings that are just going to go to the government, by the way. Those mortgage premiums basically are paid into the government. And right now there is a surplus in that account, which is why the rate reduction was slated to go into effect. There is no reason for the government to be overcharging for mortgage insurance, given the healthy balance that exists in that mortgage insurance account.  They also calculate that 30,000 to 40,000 home buyers will not buy a home in 2017 because of that order that was issued on Again, these are people who--$500 to $1,000, which is going to come out of their pocket in terms of higher payments because of this executive order--are basically going to be priced out of buying a home. The home builders, the realtors, the people who are closest to the market and clearly are not partisan--I mean, I know a lot of these guys in my district, and they are staunch Republicans in many cases--are dumbfounded at the fact that that order, of all things, within the first hours of the new administration, would be a priority for, again, the new Trump administration.  We have work to do in terms of getting this economy turned around, but if you look at home ownership, home construction, buying a house, having a healthy real estate market, that is absolutely the sweet spot of trying to succeed in this country. We do not need to be overcharging Americans for mortgage insurance, which, again, is the gateway for home ownership, particularly at that lower end of the market. Because every time someone buys a house for $200,000 or $250,000 in Connecticut, which is towards the lower end, or even lower in other parts of the country, that frees up existing homeowners either to buy up or to retire or get a condo. When those people are locked out--which raising these mortgage insurance premiums are going to effectively do--we are just stifling the real estate market from recovering. That is a bad start in terms of an administration that says it is about growing America's economy.  I will pledge to my constituents that I am going to do everything I can to reverse that unwise order and help the folks who are out there doing the hard work of selling houses, building houses, hiring people, to accomplish their goal because when they succeed, America succeeds.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH564.txt,1836,MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS ALLOWABLE USE ACT,2017.0,23.0,February

3296,topic-id,1971,"Mr.President, I want to thank my esteemed colleague from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, for his comments. He shared many of the same views I have.  As I think about the job I do as a Senator--perhaps one of the most important jobs we have as Senators is approving a Supreme Court An Associate Justice of the Supreme Court can serve an average of 27 years. We think about Justice Scalia; he served 30 years. Neil Gorsuch is 49 years old. God willing, he probably will serve 30 years or more, perhaps. Think about that. My wife and I have four children. They are going through the college years and so forth. They are in their early and midtwenties. They will likely be grandparents when Judge Gorsuch wraps up his career on the Supreme Court, assuming he is approved. That is why a decision like this about whom to vote for, whom to stand behind, whom to stand with is so important. It is not just for today, it is for our children and our grandchildren.  The people want a Supreme Court Justice who does not legislate from the bench. The people want a Supreme Court Justice who upholds the rule of law and follows the The people want a Supreme Court Justice with a record of constitutional jurisprudence and legal restraint to match what we saw from Justice Antonin The people want a Supreme Court Justice with the academic credentials, who is well prepared to serve the American people on our highest Court, to wrestle with some of the most complicated issues that the High Court wrestles with.  When President Trump announced that he was appointing Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Court, the American people knew he was truly a supreme pick. He has a brilliant legal mind. He understands the role a judge plays in our judicial system--to interpret the law and not to legislate from the bench. In fact, on the night he was announced, when President Trump revealed his pick, I was at the White House, and I heard Judge Gorsuch say: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.'' That is the humility of a great judge.  Judge Gorsuch has impeccable legal qualifications that demonstrate he will be the type of Justice every American deserves to have on the highest He graduated from Harvard Law He was a Harry Truman Scholar, graduated with honors in 1991. He earned his law degree and then attended Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar and received his doctorate degree in 2004 from  As we say out West, and as a Montanan, I have to say I am thrilled to see somebody from Colorado be nominated for the Supreme We say out West: Go get a good education and then get over it. And he brings that kind of humility to the bench. He understands that he is beneath the law, he is subject to the law. He is there to interpret the law, not to make the law.  He clerked for Justice Byron He clerked for Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court of the United In fact, in 2006, Judge Gorsuch was nominated by then-President Bush to the Tenth Circuit in Denver, He was confirmed without any opposition, including the support of 11 current Democratic In fact, some of those Democrats included Harvard Law classmate Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and the current minority leader, Chuck During his time as a judge on the Tenth Circuit, he has built a solid reputation as a respected jurist with a very distinguished record.  One thing about serving on the Tenth Circuit Court for 10 years: You can run, but you can't hide. He has left a track record. It is an impressive track record. It is a consistent record of defending the Constitution, including respecting the separation of powers and respecting federalism and the Bill of Rights to protect every American from government overreach and government abuse.

We spoke about the Second We spoke about protecting life and upholding our civil liberties.

Our Founding Fathers were not thinking about deer hunting or elk hunting when they were discussing the Second It was about liberty. It was about freedom. These are western values. Judge Gorsuch's background and record strongly suggest that he recognizes and adheres to these values. He will uphold the law. He will rightfully check the administration and Congress when their actions are not done under the law, like President Obama's EPA power plan or the WOTUS rule.

In fact, I came to the House of Representatives in the election of 1984, and I had the honor of knowing Dan Coats beginning at that time.  As is well known, Dan Coats left the Senate and became our Ambassador to Germany, where he did an outstanding job. He came back to the U.Senate and served in this body with distinction and honor. Now he goes on to serve as the Director of National  I could argue that a dedicated, experienced, knowledgeable, and courageous Director of National Intelligence[[Page S1824]]is now needed more than at any time that I can remember in the last many years.  With divisions within the intelligence community, there are challenges to the credibility of the intelligence community along the lines that I have never seen. There are questions about the activities of the intelligence community. For example, the President of the United States alleges that Trump Tower was ``wiretapped,'' in his words, by the previous administration, and we see the former Director of National Intelligence both before the Congress and on national television stating that those allegations are not true.  There are probably more questions and more controversy surrounding our intelligence services than at any time since anyone can remember, since So this is a perfect time, in my view, for Dan Coats to assume the highest responsibilities of our Director of National He has the respect and indeed affection of Members on both sides of the aisle because of his successful efforts at working in a bipartisan fashion. He served on the Intelligence He served on that committee in a very dedicated and knowledgeable fashion.  I hope my colleagues will unanimously vote in favor of our former colleague. Both sides of the aisle know him, and we know him well. I wish I had some of his qualities of congeniality and pleasantry. He has always been respectful of other views. Even in the fiercest debates that we might have, he has always been respectful of those who disagree. So he comes to the job with the much needed credibility that will make him immediately effective.  Let's be frank. The intelligence communities are probably under greater attack in a whole variety of ways, both on whether the American people trust them to do the job that they are doing or whether they have become a partisan organization. I think that with the respect and appreciation and affection that those of us who had the privilege of knowing him--on both sides of the aisle--and knowing what an honorable and decent person he is, he will not only serve as an effective Director of National Intelligence, but he will serve to restore credibility.  God knows we need credibility at this time, as we see the Russians trying to affect the outcome of our election, as we see today the Russians trying to affect the French election and possibly the German election, as we see unprecedented cyber attacks--more than at any time in the past. With the challenge of cyber alone, where our adversaries or our potential adversaries are equal to or even, in some cases, more capable of exercising their abilities and capabilities in the cyber realm, then we are in a very difficult and challenging struggle.  That is why I think that many times in history, not only does the man make the job but the job makes the man. I am confident, in the case of Senator Dan Coats, that will be the case.  I thank the Democratic leader for allowing this vote to take place so Dan Coats can get to work immediately.  I urge my colleagues to offer their support with their vote for this nomination of a great and good and gentle man who has again volunteered to serve his Nation, for which all of us should be appreciative, and I am sure we are.

What it means is that through offering Medicaid to those in low-income categories, offering help to pay premiums for those in middle-income categories, and offering choices in the insurance exchange, we have really changed health insurance in America in 6 years.  Now Americans realize that when they take a look at their actual health insurance policy, it is worth something. It may be hard to remember--but we should--that only 6 years ago, if you happened to have a child with a preexisting condition and you were not lucky enough to have your insurance through your employer and you went out on the open market, you were in for a rough ride. Many health insurance companies would not insure a family with a child who had a history of diabetes or surviving cancer. We changed that. We said that no health insurance company in America can discriminate against a person or family because of a preexisting medical condition. Is there one of us who lives in a family which doesn't have a relative, a close relative, with a preexisting condition? That was an important reform that was part of the Affordable Care Act,  We also came to realize they were selling health insurance to people with some fine print that made a difference--lifetime limits on coverage. Well, I have $1 million coverage. That sounds great, until the next diagnosis or the next accident. Now, $1 million doesn't seem like such a large amount of money, and God forbid you end up with a chronic illness.  One of my constituents came by to visit me 2 weeks ago. She was a guest of one of the Members of Congress during the President's speech to the joint session. She was diagnosed a few years ago with an unusual disease, one that is life-threatening at any given moment. She told me that in the past 3 years, she has spent more than $700,000 on medication--$700,000--and that will be a burden she faces for the rest of her life.  If her health insurance had a limit on how much it paid, there would reach a point where she couldn't buy the medicine she needs to save her life. We did away with that, and we said: You can't discriminate against people by putting these limits. We also said: When it comes to charging premiums, you can't discriminate against a person applying for health insurance solely because they happen to be a woman.  There has been a lot of controversy over that in the House in their debate over the last week or so, but what we said basically is that when it comes to insurance risk, put everyone in together, make this a bigger pool of people seeking health insurance so insurance can be profitable and affordable at the same time.  We also said: When it comes to the premiums charged on health insurance--and I call attention to all of us over the age of 50--we said you cannot discriminate in premiums you charge in health insurance. There can't be a disparity of more than 3 to 1 for the most expensive health insurance policy to the least expensive. We also said, in addition to that, if you have a child, son or daughter, graduating college and looking for a job but has no healthcare benefits, keep them on your family plan until they reach the age of 26. I have been through that. Most families have.  I had a recent college graduate, no longer with student health insurance, and I said: Jennifer, do you have health insurance?  Dad, I feel just great.  No father wants to hear that answer. So we changed the law.  When it came to Medicare, under the Affordable Care Act, we said: We are going to eliminate the gap in coverage for prescription drugs for seniors. They used to call it the doughnut hole. It made no sense. It was something only Congress could dream up. We closed it and said: We are going to give seamless coverage to Medicare prescription drugs. That was part of the Affordable Care  We put in incentives for people providing medical care to find ways to give us good quality care and reduce the cost. What was the net result? The slowest growth in hospitalization premiums for employer-based healthcare that we have seen in modern times.  When they put this new model for healthcare against the Medicare Program--that is a program for seniors and disabled--guess what. It bought 10 years of solvency for That[[Page S1785]]meant a program that is critically important for 60 million Americans had 10 more years of solvency.  Did this program have problems? Of course it did. When you take on the healthcare system of America, you are not going to get it completely right the first time. I believed--and many others did--that as important and valuable as that vote was, we had to be prepared to return to this program to make sure we addressed problems as they would arise.  For example, there is nothing in the Affordable Care Act of substance when it comes to controlling the price of pharmaceuticals--prescription drugs.  Well, I can tell you what has happened. Blue Cross Blue Shield in Chicago came to see me, and the CEO said: Blue Cross Blue Shield is now paying more for prescription drugs than we are paying for inpatient hospital care. The cost of drugs has gone through the roof. The net result of that, of course, is the cost of healthcare goes up too. The Affordable Care Act should have addressed that but did not.  We also had to find a way to make sure there was health insurance available all around the United Some companies jumped in; some jumped out. Many of us believe we should have a single-payer plan available in every part of America so you could choose for your family a Medicare-type plan if you wish. Otherwise, you would go to a private health insurance company, if you wish. It is your choice.  The Republicans opposed the Affordable Care In the House, they voted against it 57, 58 times--I lose count. Then came the day when they had the majority in the Senate, in the House, and in the White House--the answer to their prayers. Now, once and for all, they can get rid of the Affordable Care They have the votes, but then there was a problem.  People across America started asking: If you repeal it, what will happen next? Will I still be able to get health insurance? Will I be protected if I have a preexisting condition? Will there be limits on what the policy covers?  Well, they hadn't quite thought that far ahead to look for the substitute, to look for the replacement. So they went to work in a matter of 5 or 6 weeks and created what is now being considered by the House of Representatives--the Republican replacement plan.  The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan office that takes a look at our bills and legislation and puts a score on them. How much is it going to cost? What is it going to do?  We waited for Congressional Budget Office scores over and over again when we wrote the Affordable Care They would come in and say: Nope, you have to go back to the drawing board. You have to change this and change that.  Well, just this week, they came out with the score on the Republican replacement plan, the one to replace the Affordable Care They took a look at it, and here is what they told us.  To start off with, the Republican replacement plan throws people off health insurance coverage. How many? Remember when President Trump said the GOP healthcare bill would have ``insurance for everybody''? Under TrumpCare, the new Republican plan, TrumpCare, 14 million people would lose their health coverage next year. By 2026, 24 million people will have lost their healthcare coverage.  Is this what we were looking for in the replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act, to say to 24 million Americans, you will no longer have health insurance coverage? Think about the outcome of that. Think about someone with a chronically ill child or someone who faces a chronic illness themself with no health insurance.  Think about a working person who has no health insurance where they work. At least they had coverage through Medicaid and perhaps through the insurance exchange with a subsidy. Now they are losing it.  Think about those same people without health insurance. They will still get sick and will still go to the hospital but will be unable to pay. Incidentally, their bills they can't pay, we pay. Those bills are passed on to everyone else.  So the first plank of the Republican TrumpCare, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is to eliminate health insurance for 24 million In addition, the Republican TrumpCare plan significantly raises premium costs on seniors.  According to the official Congressional Budget Office estimate, the bill will ``substantially raise premiums for older people.'' How does that happen? Well, in addition to cutting back on the financial assistance for seniors to buy health insurance, TrumpCare would allow insurance companies to charge older people significantly more than the Affordable Care Remember the limit, the 3-to-1 limit on premiums that we built into the Affordable Care Act? TrumpCare says: No, make that 5 to 1. So it means, if you are over the age of 50, buying health insurance, your premiums can go up dramatically, according to the Congressional Budget  There is another thing too. As we take more and more people off of health insurance coverage, it really, in a way, dampens the incentive for affordable healthcare so the costs are not contained as they are today, and the solvency of Medicare--which we said was 10 years more, remember that--they reduce it by 4 years.  What the Republican TrumpCare plan has done is it threatens the solvency of Is that what we were looking for on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act? I don't think so.  TrumpCare also raises costs for lower and middle-income families. By repealing the cost-sharing subsidies and lowering the bar on health plans, the Congressional Budget Office says that lower and middle-class families shopping in the individual market should expect to see--and I quote from the report--``substantially increasing out-of-pocket costs.''  The bill also defunds Planned Parenthood, which was to be expected. We expected it in many bills. According to the Congressional Budget Office, defunding of Planned Parenthood would ``affect services that help women avert pregnancies . . . most likely residing in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations.'' The Congressional Budget Office projects that 15 percent of those people--again, these are lower income women in medically underserved areas of America--would lose access to care.  Also, TrumpCare, at the same time it does this--eliminates health insurance for 24 million, raises the premium costs, and defunds Planned For good measure, TrumpCare also provides tax cuts to the wealthiest people in Is that what we were looking for? Was that part of the bargain? Those making over $1 million a year in income will get a $50,000 tax cut from the TrumpCare bill. The wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent get a tax cut of nearly $200,000.  Finally, while cutting taxes for the very rich, TrumpCare also slashes $880 billion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years. Medicaid is a vital healthcare program. Most people think about Medicaid--oh, that is health insurance for the poor. It is. But who are the poor? Overwhelmingly in numbers, they are children and their moms who are in low-income groups. That is the biggest number, but the biggest expense for Medicaid isn't kids and their moms. It is grandma and grandpa. It is our families and parents who are in an assisted care home who have Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to get by.  These cuts by the Republicans and TrumpCare to Medicaid will be felt by families across the board. In addition, it means that those who represent States like mine and the Presiding Officer's, with rural populations that have small hospitals that depend on patients paying something when they come through the door--many of them are paying through Medicaid, and if Medicaid is reduced, the payments to the hospitals are reduced.  That is why the Illinois Hospital Association warns us against The Illinois Hospital Association says it will threaten the hospitals of my They will not be receiving the Medicaid reimbursement. They believe that up to 90,000 jobs at these hospitals will be lost in I will tell you, as a downstater, those are some of the best paying jobs in the community. Many of my small towns trying to keep businesses or attract businesses brag up their hospital, as they should, and now TrumpCare threatens the future of these hospitals.[[Page S1786]]  Medicaid is a vital healthcare program for 65 million Americans--seniors, persons with disabilities, children, and low-income families nationwide, 3 million of them in my TrumpCare would devastate the program. By 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 14 million fewer people would have  The Affordable Care Act took a lot of good steps toward improving healthcare for seniors. Before the Affordable Care Act, the number of uninsured adults ages 50 to 64 rose substantially--growing from 3.7 million in 2000 to 8.9 million in 2010. Insurance companies were rejecting more than one in five applications from individuals between the ages of 50 and 64.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the rate of uninsured adults ages 50 to 64 dropped 47.4 percent, from 11.6 percent to 6.1 percent. The largest reduction in the uninsured rate occurred in the States that chose to expand  The Affordable Care Act also prohibited insurers from denying coverage, as I said earlier, to people with preexisting conditions. It limited how much insurers can charge older enrollees, closed the doughnut hole, and made important preventive services available for free, such as colonoscopies and annual checkups.  Let's look at what the TrumpCare program--the Republican program--does to seniors. It allows insurers to charge older people significantly more than younger people, it reduces tax credits to seniors who pay their premiums, and it would devastate the Medicaid Program, which helps to pay for two out of every three seniors in nursing home care.  There is another thing I want to make a note of. Many years ago in the Senate, back at that corner desk, sat a Senator from Minnesota named Paul Wellstone, a Over here on the aisle sat Pete Domenici of New Mexico, a For years they argued that we should include in every health insurance plan in America coverage for mental health, and the insurance companies fought them. Because many mental health conditions are chronic and long-term and may, in some cases, be expensive, they didn't want them. But Wellstone and Domenici had family members who struggled with mental illness, and they said we need to include this in every health insurance plan. Thank goodness they finally prevailed. Every health insurance plan in this country has to treat physical health issues and mental health issues the same, thanks to Wellstone and thanks to  In addition they added something that many of us overlooked: It said mental health and substance abuse treatment. What does that mean? It means that if some member of your family is addicted, your health insurance plan can help pay for the help they need to get rid of their addiction. For a lot of people it was the only place for them to turn, and it worked, and thank goodness it did, because we are at that moment in American history where because of opioids, heroin, and fentanyl, we have dramatic increases in addiction.  Now what is going to happen under the TrumpCare approach when it comes to mental illness and substance abuse treatment? Are we going to require--mandate--every health insurance plan to include mental health treatment as well as substance abuse? Over and over we hear from our Republican friends: We want competition. We want choice. We want to eliminate mandates.  They can take that approach, but we are going to lose coverage for 24 million If they take that approach, we are going to be offering health insurance plans that aren't there when families need them.  We had a roundtable discussion in Rockford, IL, last When I go to these communities, I bring in people who are administrators of the hospitals, the doctors, the nurses, the clinics, the substance abuse treatment centers. To a person, they oppose Every single one of them said that it is the wrong thing to do at this moment in time. It will leave people more vulnerable. It will leave families with health insurance that is worthless when they need it. Those are the bad old days we finally escaped 6 years ago, and now Republicans want us to return to this competition-choice access to healthcare. I have access to a Rolls Royce dealership, too, but I am not going to be buying a Rolls Royce because I can't afford it. If you give a person access to health insurance that they can't afford, you are not giving them anything.  What we tried to do with the Affordable Care Act is to make sure we gave people not only access but protection with health insurance. From the beginning, the Republicans have said: Let's repeal the Affordable Care Now they have found that replacing it is a lot harder than they ever expected.  I said from the beginning, as well, if the Republicans are willing to take repeal off the table, I am going to pull up a chair. If they want a bipartisan approach, an honest approach to making the Affordable Care Act better, let's sit down and talk. Sign me up. If the goal is to give more people good health insurance that they can afford to protect their families, if the goal is to find ways to give us better healthcare, quality results at a lower cost, I want to be a part of that conversation. But if the goal is to deny health insurance coverage to 24 million Americans, count me out. That to me is a step backward in time.  What comes next? If the Republicans do this to the Affordable Care Act, what is next--Medicare? Well, we happen to know the Secretary of Health and Human Services believes in privatizing I don't. I think that is a step in the wrong direction, and it will reduce the protection of But if they will do this to the Affordable Care Act, then can Medicare or Social Security be far behind?  It is important that we maintain our values when it comes to critical programs that America and its families count on.  I hope the House of Representatives defeats TrumpCare, puts it out of its misery, and then invites all of us to come together on a bipartisan basis to talk about what we really need for healthcare in this country.  I find it incredible that there is no major medical group in America today that supports TrumpCare--none, not one. All we have is some conservative think tanks that believe this is a wonderful model. But the people on the ground--the administrators in the hospitals, the doctors, the clinicians, the nurses, the people in the healthcare clinics--all tell us TrumpCare is a disaster. It is a step in the wrong direction. It is going to decrease coverage and increase costs. That is not something that America needs for its future.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

3329,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about another rule the Republicans want to overturn instead of working with Democrats to create jobs. This rule outlines when State unemployment agencies can drug test applicants for unemployment benefits.  Today there are roughly 7.6 million Americans who are unemployed, and over 2 million of these unemployed Americans are collecting unemployment insurance. About 150,000 of these people live in  Unemployment insurance benefits provide a lifeline to many workers and families who are struggling to make ends meet. If this resolution passes, my Republican colleagues will succeed in preventing hard-working Americans from receiving these benefits, and they will succeed in making it more difficult for unemployed Americans to find work.  This past August, the Department of Labor finalized a rule that explains when State unemployment agencies can subject unemployment benefit applicants to a drug test. The rule clarifies which occupations regularly conduct drug testing, as established by the Department of Labor, to help State programs that conduct drug testing.  This rule makes sure States have the guidance they need to implement drug testing requirements in a fair and legal[[Page S1794]]mariner, but if this partisan CRA is signed into law, it will undo a bipartisan compromise that was created to ensure equitable access to unemployment benefits.  Unemployed Americans have paid into the unemployment insurance program, and they are entitled to receive that insurance when they lose their job to circumstances beyond their control. By supporting blanket drug testing of unemployment insurance applicants, my Republican colleagues are targeting hard-working Americans who in many cases have fallen on hard times.  And let me be clear, this will make it more difficult for them to receive the benefits they have earned.  Millions of Americans around the country voted for leaders who would fight for the working class. Repealing this rule will be another broken promise to those families.  Drug testing is also expensive. In 2011, the Texas Legislative Budget Board estimated it would cost Texas $30 million over the course of just 1 year if they moved forward with a universal drug-testing policy for unemployment benefits.  When States have conducted drug testing of applicants for other government programs, like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, very few claimants have tested positive for drug use.  My Republican colleagues say that this resolution will help save taxpayer money, but overturning the Department of Labor's rule will lead to millions of wasted taxpayer dollars on drug tests that come back negative.  This resolution isn't about saving money. It is about paving the way for lawmakers who want to drug test every American who has to file for unemployment insurance; yet these same lawmakers aren't calling for drug testing Americans that claim other Federal benefits, like tax credits or deductions on their tax returns.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to remember: the Department of Labor's drug-testing rule is about real people who depend on unemployment insurance to live in  They need these benefits to put food on the table, to make a rent or mortgage payment, or to pay for gas to allow them to continue their job search.  When people become unemployed, it is often a result of company downsizing or outsourcing American jobs, not drug use. We should not and cannot unfairly stigmatize these workers and make it even more difficult for them to get back on their feet after becoming unemployed by undoing this regulation.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this resolution.  ",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,326,CALLING FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL,2017.0,14.0,March

3100,topic-id,1270,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate that, and I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia's hospitality in yielding the floor to me at this time.  Mr.Speaker, indeed, I am privileged to represent the 19th Congressional District of New York This encompasses a wide area of the mid-Hudson Valley and the Catskill region. The district touches Vermont in the northeast corner and Pennsylvania in the southeast corner. We go out to Cooperstown, and we have great local locations like Many people are familiar with Woodstock, where the concert was supposed to be back in the late 1960s, but also where the concert occurred in Bethel, New York, in Sullivan The district encompasses all or part of 11 counties.  The gentleman from Georgia referenced the fact that I have resided for the last 30, almost 34, years in Kinderhook, New York, the hometown of Martin Van Buren, our eighth Our district also has within it the town of Hyde Park in Dutchess County, which is the home of a President who was extraordinarily well-known and recognized for his great contributions to our country, Franklin I encourage people to come visit Hyde Park and the Roosevelt home and mansion, and also  I would be remiss if I did not also mention that the 19th District has the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, where I know a number of Members will be coming up later this year to play a game of baseball in a charitable fundraising event.  Mr.Speaker, Mr.Collins had made reference to the economic condition. The economic condition in upstate New York is extremely difficult. Of the 11 counties in my district, for instance, all 11 have lost population in the last 5 years. What has happened is that people are leaving because of high local taxes and burdensome rules. These come not just from Albany, but also from This is one of the things that I think the people sent me here to Congress to work on.  I ran on a platform of economic growth. We must get our economy moving, and we must get it moving fast and growing at rates that are not in the anemic 1.5 to 1.8 percent level, but up to 3, 3.5, and 4 percent if we are going to produce enough wealth and opportunity for our children and grandchildren. Indeed, Mr.Speaker, we cannot allow this generation to leave to the next generation a country that is immeasurably poorer and less well off than the country that we were given by our parents and grandparents.  I am privileged to serve on three committees here in Congress: the Budget Committee; the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where I am honored to serve as the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials; and also the Committee on All three of these committees are going to be vitally significant in terms of my tenure here in these 2 years of Congress, but also for the people of our district.  Agriculture, we have a robust and growing agricultural economy. It is dairy, where a lot of dairy farmers are struggling with the low price of milk, but also fruits and vegetables. We have got a remarkable number of new producers--yogurt producers, cheese producers, and beef and pork producers--because we live only 125 to 150 miles away from the city of New York and the tremendous metropolitan area and the tremendous market that that entails.  On the Agriculture Committee, I will be fighting hard to protect the interests of our dairy community and small farmers and to make sure that we encourage our young people to go into agriculture. I am pleased to soon support a measure which will encourage young people to go into agriculture.  On the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I mentioned the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Our district is blessed to have the beautiful Hudson The Hudson Valley--the Empire State corridor of Amtrak--is one of the busiest in the It is also one of the profit centers for Many, many people ride the train between Albany and New York City on a daily basis, in fact. It is vitally important to our commerce and to our business interests in our district.  We also have a number of freight rail facilities. I will be working closely with folks out in Otsego County and Oneonta for the project that they are looking at for their rail facility in that community.  Lastly, as I mentioned, I serve on the Budget Just today, we heard a report from the Congressional Budget The chief of the CBO came before us. He indicated that today we have almost $20 trillion of national debt.                              {time}  1630  That is just the on-the-books government national debt. He also said to us that within 10 years we are going to be facing another $10 trillion on top of[[Page H920]]that. And $30 trillion, my colleagues, is not sustainable. It is, in essence, generational theft. It is saying we would spend today our children's and grandchildren's inheritance and that we are forcing, by borrowing way beyond our means, our children and grandchildren in the future to pay for our spending today.  So this, indeed, is a crisis point. It is a crisis point for our country. It is a crisis point for every man, woman, and child in our  In fact, if you look at the data, right now our national debt is the equivalent of about $60,000 for every man, woman, and child in We have to get this under control. The way to get it under control is we have to deal with growth. We have got to get economic growth. Smart tax and regulatory changes can help us spur the private sector economy to grow this economy, to create more opportunity, to create more wealth and jobs for our families all across the Nation, but particularly, from my vantage point, in upstate New  But we also need to take a hard look at reforming entitlement programs. There is precedent for doing this. President Ronald Reagan, Tip O'Neill, the great former Senator from New York State Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and others came together in the early eighties and fixed the Social Security financing problem for over 40 years. Well, the timeline for fixing that problem is running out.  I encourage people at home and citizens all across this country, pull out your Social Security earnings statement. Pull out that statement that the Social Security Administration sends to you each year. If you look at it closely, it will say that, in 2034, just a mere 17 or 18 years from now, Social Security can only pay approximately 75 or 76 percent of the promised benefits.  We have it in our capacity to fix this problem to assure that all the seniors are taken care of and that those close and near retirement will not be affected. But we also have to reform the system so that our children and grandchildren have the prospect of something there for them in the future. We cannot, again, be the generation to leave our kids and our grandchildren holding the bag with a country less wealthy, with less opportunity than the country that our parents and grandparents gave to us.  So I am really pleased to have this opportunity to come before the House today.

3205,topic-id,374,"Mr.President, I rise with a heavy heart to mark the passing of a pillar of the Arizona law enforcement community. When people think of the Old West, they often picture a Stetson-wearing lawman sitting astride his horse, keeping watch over his community.  For generations of residents in Southwestern Arizona, that lawman was Yuma County Sheriff Ralph With his towering frame and trademark mustache, Sheriff Ogden looked every bit the part. Despite having an imposing physical presence, Sheriff Ogden was a kind, compassionate man, beloved by his deputies and celebrated by his community.  After 4 years of distinguished service in the U.Marine Corps, Ralph Ogden began his 42-year law enforcement career as a dispatcher and a jailer in Parker, A dedicated public servant, he would eventually serve as chief deputy for 12 years. Ralph would go on to be elected to five consecutive terms as sheriff, with his 20-year tenure the longest ever in Yuma county history.  Sheriff Ogden always understood the importance of getting to know the community he served. He encouraged his employees to get involved in charities, religious groups, and service organizations. He valued teamwork. He recognized that no one can succeed on[[Page S1562]]their own. This philosophy of always having some other person's back was something he carried with him throughout his time in the sheriff's office, and it was reflected in the way he treated those around him.  I was fortunate to get to know Ralph over the last few years and learned a lot of what I know about the border and about law enforcement from that great man.  Sheriff Ogden was known to write personal birthday and anniversary cards for each of his employees, just to show that he valued their service and their friendship and to show they were important to him.  When asked about the benefits of serving law enforcement, Sheriff Ogden said that when you go home tired and beat after a long day, you sleep well knowing that you did some good. Sheriff Ralph Ogden did a lot of good. I know he is resting well.  I yield back my time.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

3226,topic-id,853,"Mr.President, border security is one of the Federal Government's most important responsibilities, and the Federal Government has no better partners than local law enforcement agencies from border communities like those in my home State of These officers and deputies serve on the front lines. They provide critical assistance to the missions of Federal agencies.  Unfortunately, these efforts are expensive and the locals end up picking up most of the tab. For example, local law enforcement agencies hold those facing immigration violations at county-operated jails, and they provide medical care for the undocumented inmates while they are in custody. In providing these services, Arizona's counties have incurred more than $310 million in costs associated with criminal undocumented immigrants since 2009. That is $310 million since 2009.  Despite these enormous costs, the Federal Government has left many local jurisdictions to shoulder the burdens of illegal immigration on their own. This is particularly frustrating when so many of our local law enforcement agencies are already struggling to carry out basic duties on overstretched budgets.  I hope we can all look forward to a time when we have the appropriate resources for securing the border, the means for those seeking to fill the needs of our economy to enter the country legally, a remedy for those who are here already illegally, and also a way for employers to ensure that those whom they hire are legally present.  These critical steps toward solving our immigration problems will require Congress to act. However, in the meantime, we can't continue to allow the Federal Government to pass off immigration responsibilities onto cash-strapped local agencies.  That is why I wish today to introduce a bill to reauthorize and reform the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, better known as This bill is cosponsored by my friend and colleague, John McCain, and is supported by the Arizona Sheriffs  SCAAP is a Federal program that reimburses State, local, and Tribal law enforcement for the costs associated with incarcerating and caring for criminal undocumented immigrants while in custody.  To ensure that local law enforcement receives sufficient reimbursement under SCAAP, my bill would make some commonsense reforms under the program. The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to reauthorize SCAAP through fiscal year 2021. Reauthorizing this program will provide local law enforcement agencies in Arizona and across the country with the certainty that any costs incurred from incarcerating criminal immigrants will be covered by Federal reimbursements.  Our State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies are committed to partnering with the Federal Government on immigration enforcement. But that partnership can't succeed unless the Federal Government provides the necessary reimbursements for those services.  As Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels said:       Arizona's counties continue to struggle under the fiscal      strain of anemic growth in rural areas and cost-shifts from      the State of Housing criminal aliens without federal      assistance diverts needed resources away from our      communities' public safety priorities.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the Arizona Sheriffs Association in support of my bill to reauthorize SCAAP be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 Arizona Sheriffs Association,                                                   March 15, 2017.     Re State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP)              Jeff Flake,     U.Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington,       Dear Senator Flake: On behalf of a majority of the Arizona      Sheriffs Association, I would like to express support for      Congress's proposed reauthorization of the State Criminal      Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP).       County sheriffs maintain the shared responsibility of      enforcing Arizona's criminal laws. We also serve as the      keeper of Arizona's county jails, including paying for the      cost of medical care for inmates. While the federal      government continues to address the problem of illegal      immigration, Arizona's jails incarcerate undocumented      immigrants who have committed state and local violations,      incurring significant costs in custody and care of these      inmates, including medical costs. SCAAP provides critical      dollars to Arizona's counties that help pay for the cost of      housing and caring for these inmates while they are in our      custody.       Arizona's counties continue to struggle under the fiscal      strain of anemic growth in rural areas and cost-shifts from      the State of Housing criminal aliens without federal      assistance diverts needed resources away from our      communities' public safety priorities. We understand that      federal dollars cannot fully supplant state costs for these[[Page S2051]]     inmates. However, any financial assistance the federal      government can appropriate to help pay for the costs of      caring for these inmates will allow Arizona's sheriffs to      concentrate on other important priorities, such as drug      interdiction and search and rescue.       Since 2009, Arizona's counties have absorbed more than $310      million in costs. A SCAAP reauthorization that includes      reimbursement for medical costs would provide vital financial      resources to Arizona's sheriffs, allowing us to better serve      the public safety needs of our counties.       That's why on behalf of Arizona's county sheriffs, I write      to express support for the reauthorization of the State      Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). We encourage      Congress to pass the measure and for President Trump to sign      it if it reaches his desk.

Next week, my colleagues and I on the Judiciary Committee will hold confirmation hearings on Judge I look forward to hearing his testimony. I am confident that he will impress the country with his knowledge of and respect for the law, just as he has impressed me and my colleagues.  But before the hearings get under way, I thought I would use this opportunity today to highlight an additional aspect of his life and his jurisprudence that make him an ideal nominee to serve on the High So far I have spoken on the floor about his fitness to fill Justice Scalia's seat, as well as his defense of the separation of powers and his support for religious liberty. Today I would like to discuss a more personal aspect of Judge Gorsuch's background--the fact that he is a westerner. As an Arizonan, I cannot overstate how important it will be to have a fellow westerner serving on the Supreme  Where you are from influences your understanding of cultural and regional sensitivities. When you look at the current makeup of the Supreme Court, there is an unmistakable lack of geographic diversity. Of the eight current Justices, five of them were born in New York or New Jersey, and that number was six before Judge Scalia's passing. Granted, Justice Kennedy is from Northern California, but to be frank, much of Northern California is about as culturally western as Justice Breyer's hometown of  The Supreme Court is in desperate need of a western perspective. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill. When I had the opportunity to meet Judge Gorsuch in my office last month, we discussed our respective western backgrounds. I talked to him about my days growing up on a cattle ranch in rural He told me that his heart has always been in the American You can learn a lot about a person by how they spend their time with their friends and their family, and there is no mistaking this aspect with Judge He is a westerner through and through.  He told me about his home outside of Boulder, where his daughters raise and show chickens and goats. I was pleased to learn that each year he takes his law clerks to the National Western Stock Show in Denver, one of the Nation's largest rodeos. By now, I think we have all seen the picture of him fly fishing with Judge While all this demonstrates how much he has embraced the western lifestyle, what makes Judge Gorsuch a true westerner is more than just where he lives or where his personal interests are. Judge Gorsuch's western values are evident in his jurisprudence, which reflects a strong commitment to public service. Arizona has had its share of distinguished public servants. In fact, it was from this very desk that the late Barry Goldwater, one of Arizona's favorite sons, steered the public policy debate[[Page S1822]]for years after he chose to leave a successful career in the private sector. Judge Gorsuch's career reflects the same ethos.  Early on, a young Neil Gorsuch rocketed to the top of the legal profession, becoming a partner in one of Washington's most elite law firms. But instead of enjoying the comforts of a lucrative private sector career, he left it all behind for a high-responsibility, low-profile job at the Department of  After his time at DOJ, Neil Gorsuch could have easily retired or returned to a white-shoe legal practice. Instead, he returned to his home State of Colorado to serve as a judge on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Throughout his tenure on the Federal bench, Judge Gorsuch's western disposition has shone through in his jurisprudence.  I have already spoken of his skepticism toward the administrative state, with its executive bureaucracies, which, he cautions, ``swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate Federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design.''  He shares a healthy skepticism over an overly intrusive and heavy-handed bureaucracy with millions of his Federal westerners. Judge Gorsuch recognizes how Federal regulations interfere with the ability of Western States to govern themselves, whether it is a former administration's Clean Power Plan, its ozone rules, or even management of the Mexican gray wolf.  In numerous opinions, Judge Gorsuch has given voice to many of the frustrations experienced by his western neighbors. From his criticism of an overly assertive DC court that often feels compelled to intervene from 2,000 miles away to his recognition of excessive litigation that arises from the complexities of split-estate property rights out West, he speaks our language.  These are perspectives any westerner is familiar with, but they may not be obvious to others, including folks from New York and New If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will already bring generational and religious diversity to the Perhaps more than anything, it will be his western perspective that most enriches the debate in the years to come.

3152,topic-id,1187,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the Speaker for this opportunity to continue the discussion. My colleague from Texas really left here a moment ago with a plea about bringing down the cost of health care in Actually, it was the cost of premiums in That is a plea that I think all 435 of us would echo. It would certainly be our goal, as representatives of the American people, to find some way to accomplish that, some way to bring down the cost of premiums.  I would like just to make a point right at the outset. When discussing health care, there are really two connected, but very separate, parts to the healthcare system.  One part is the delivery of medical services. These are the doctors, some of whom are in organizations of doctors of various specialties. Some are in large practices, such as the Kaiser practice. Some are in hospitals disconnected from doctors. But there is just a plethora of different ways in which medical services are delivered. That is the delivery of medical services. That is one part of it.  The other part of the healthcare system in America, and really anywhere in the world, is the collection of money to pay for the services. Now, in the United States, we have many different ways to collect the money. One of them is through taxes. And this is how we pay for Medicare and Medicaid, what we call MediCal in We pay for the veterans' medical services through the collection of taxes, children's health services, and some other programs that are much smaller. So that is one way in which we collect the money to pay for services. You might call those single-payer taxpayer services, taxpayers' money being spent on services delivered by that whole range of providers, some of which happen to be government providers, for example, the Veterans Administration and military medical services.  Now, the other way in which we collect money to pay for services are premiums, health insurance premiums that are charged by health insurance companies. The largest single part of that is from corporations, businesses, that buy health insurance and pay the premiums. And the others are individuals, and this is the individual insurance market. There are some small group markets out there, also. But these two systems, we need to understand that they are different. They are connected, obviously.  Now, if we are going to deal with the cost of premiums, you have to go over and deal with the cost of health care, because the health care drives the premiums and also drives the amount of money that we need to raise to pay for the services that are provided by the various governmental programs.  Now, in the Affordable Care Act, which is now some 7 years old Thursday of this week, the seventh anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, there are some very powerful mechanisms to reduce the cost of health care--doctors, hospitals, and the rest. Some of these are electronic medical records so that there is a continuity of knowledge as to what happened, what was provided, what services were provided to the individual.                              {time}  1730  Another one happens to be a penalty assessed on hospitals for hospital readmissions on hospital-acquired infections--profound in driving down the cost; also extremely important for individuals because hospital infection rates dramatically dropped.  There are also ways in which we pay for the services. It is very clear that the utilization of fee-for-service drove up the cost.  Anyway, as we go through this discussion today on the Affordable Care Act, and I see I am being joined by my colleagues here, I just want us to keep in mind that in order to deal with the cost of premiums, you have got to deal with the cost of services that are provided.  Now, in the Affordable Care Act, we actually saw, over the last 5 years as the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, went into effect, a decrease in the rate of increase. We haven't seen a decrease in the cost of medical services, but what we have seen is that the inflation rate has significantly reduced, so much so that the financial security of the Medicare program, which is the single biggest expenditure, has been extended by some 11 years because the inflation rate has declined--not decreased, but the rate of inflation has declined almost 50 percent from what it was before the Affordable Care  That is a direct result of the many reforms that went into the way in which medical services were delivered. That allowed for a lower inflation rate for premiums and an extension of the financial viability of Medicare and other medical programs.  Now, unfortunately, we are now faced with a repeal or a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and the promise has been made by my Republican colleagues that somehow this will reduce the premiums. Well, that is interesting. Now, exactly how are you going to reduce the premiums unless you are dealing with the cost of medical care?  In their reforms, there is--as best I can determine and everybody else--no effective way to reduce the cost of medical services and, in fact, the high probability that the cost of medical services will increase, specifically, because, in their proposed reform, men and women that are 45, 50 to 65 are going to find it virtually impossible to continue to buy insurance. They will drop their insurance. That is part of those 14 million Americans that will lose their insurance next year and part of the 24 million Americans that will not have insurance 9 years from now.  That population, before they get to Medicare, when they begin to get ill, 40, 50, 60, they will not be able to afford insurance. It is something like a $12,000 increase in cost to them. It is what is known as the senior tax.  Now, that will drive up the cost of medical services. Because they will not be able to have continuity of care, their diabetes, their heart issues, their high blood pressure, and on and on will not be treated.  Similarly, in the proposed reform, there is a significant reduction in the number of men and women across this Nation--and we are talking probably in the range of 4 to 6 million in the next 2 years that will not be covered under the Medicaid program. Those people, not having access to continuous medical services, will not seek treatment for those illnesses that can be treated effectively or held in abeyance, such as diabetes, heart disease, and the like. That means that the cost of medical care for them will rise.  Where will they go to get medical care? Not to worry, say our Republican colleagues. They can go to the emergency room. We have been there. We have seen what that means.  The expansion of the Medicaid program is unraveled by the proposed I am going to come back to this.

I was going through a rather complete explanation of how the healthcare system works because it is kind of a basic understanding, but clearly, under the legislation that is going to be taken up this Thursday, Americans are going to pay more for less. And it is not just a few.  The senior citizens in Medicare are going to see a diminution in their benefits. We are looking at the 40-to 50-years-olds, which I have already discussed. We are looking at other individuals.  Pay more for less, we are looking, over the next 9 years, that 24 million Americans will lose their insurance or their opportunity to get insurance. And just this next year, just 18 months from now--excuse me, not 18 months from now. Nine months from now, we are going to see 14 million people begin to lose their insurance.  I talked earlier about this age tax, which speaks to those people that are 50 to 65 years of age. They are, under this legislation, going to pay up to five times more than someone who is between 20 and 30 years of age.                              {time}  1745  Present law says they can be charged no more than three times what a 20- to 30-year-old pays, and so this is what is known as an age tax. It simply shifts the cost to those 40-, 50-, 60-year-old people who happen to be the most expensive. And I talked about the $12,000 that they will have to pay in addition to that.  It guts We call it Medi-Cal in California and Medicaid across the The expansion of Medicaid was an extraordinarily important event that provided insurance not only to men and women who had no income, but to 85 percent of the people on Medicaid across this Nation who are elderly, in nursing homes, or elderly poor, unable to provide sufficient income from just their Social Security--those are called the dual eligible--or children.  Now, in the Affordable Care Act, there was what was known as Medicaid expansion; and those are the working men and women, families, who have less than 138 percent of the poverty rate. So those are the low-income working men and women who are able to get Medicaid, or Medi-Cal insurance in It simply guts it in a variety of ways, which we will come back and discuss a little later.  You can bet and you can count on there being less support for the elderly that are in nursing homes. There will be less support for the young families; the single-mother families who are struggling to get along, probably going to school, trying to learn skills; and for[[Page H2282]]the working families who are at $10 an hour minimum wage.  Finally, this is the one that ought to drive Americans right off the rails. This is a whopping $270 billion tax reduction for the top 1 percent of It is for 400 families in America, the richest 400, four of which are in the current Trump administration, including the President himself. They will see a $7 million a year decrease in their taxes.  Now, that is great. I am sure the President will enjoy that $7 million tax reduction, along with the $3 million or $4 million he is getting from the taxpayers every year so he can go to his home in  This is obscene. This is obscene because the way in which this thing works, working men and women and families across America at every income level are going to get less. They are going to pay for more, and yet the superwealthy in America are going to get a whopping tax reduction. This is the income distribution that we should never have, to take from the poor, to take from the middle class, and give to the superwealthy. I will come back and discuss this.

I, too, have received many, many emails.  I was thinking, as he was describing the situation, of a woman who runs her own small farm near Marysville, California, in my district. For years, she could not afford insurance. She had a small orchard farm. She couldn't afford insurance. When she got sick, she went to the emergency room. She was able to get along.  But she knew that, as she approached 50 years of age, she would be facing a bad medical situation, and she did. She had cancer. She couldn't get a policy prior to the Affordable Care Act because she had a preexisting condition: she had cancer. Emergency rooms are not treating that. She wasn't able to get on a program, and she was going to die.  About that time, we established, in California, a covered California program that is an exchange based upon the Affordable Care She, because of her income, was able to get a comprehensive insurance policy and a subsidy for her premium. She then had quality insurance, and she was able to get the cancer treatment because her insurance had no preexisting conditions and she was able to afford it. She had to pay a little bit, but she had a subsidy that made up the difference.  She is now looking at a situation, because she is in that age 50 to 65, where she will not be able to afford a $12,000- or $14,000-a-year premium because the subsidies were taken out and because of this age tax, the 1-to-5 ratio rather than the 1-to-3 ratio.

I want to wrap up with just a couple of thoughts.  One of my Republican friends came up to me earlier today. He said: I don't understand. I don't understand what our team is doing. All we are doing is changing the name and hurting people.  I thought about that for a few moments, and, yes, it is Ryan or TrumpCare, but people are going to be hurt all across this  One more story, and I think we will probably wrap up here, and that is of my wife's hairstylist. She is a young lady, married, private businessowner, trying to get along, and not enough money to buy insurance. The Affordable Care Act goes into place. She looks at the exchange, and she is able to get comprehensive insurance, maternity care, and at an affordable price because of the subsidies that are built into it. She was so happy when she talked to my wife.  She said: I have insurance. For the first time in my life, I am able to buy insurance, and I am going to get pregnant. I am going to have the baby that my husband and I have always wanted because now we have insurance--not just for myself, but for my child and my husband.  The next visit, she is asking: They are not going to take it away, are they? They are not going to take it away, are they?  Well, yes, for 14 million Americans--next year, 2018, 9 months from now, 14 million Americans will begin to lose their insurance. I am not sure if this young lady will be among them or the farm lady that I talked about earlier, but they are at risk all across America--14 million people in less than 1 year, and then, beyond that, over the ensuing years, 24 million  It has been argued that the Affordable Care Act is in a death spiral. I was an insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and that is not true. It is an alternate fact. The fact of the matter is that the Affordable Care Act is working--not without some problems here and there, but it is working. It is not in a death spiral.  That is probably a good place to leave it, except this TrumpCare--RyanCare--is a problem.

President Obama promised that he would act independently of Congress where he had to; his quote: ``Where they won't act, I will.'' I have come to the floor to discuss the many examples of Executive overreach that we have witnessed, from unilateral pursuit of climate change regulations to unconstitutional recess appointments.  As I have said before, the structure of our Constitution is a critical safeguard of our liberty. As Justice Scalia famously said:       Every banana republic in the world has a bill of rights.      Every President for life has a bill of rights. The real key      to the distinctiveness of America is the structure of our      government.  Now, I have served in the Senate for 36 years, so I have a deep appreciation of the different roles of the coordinate branches and for the fact that the people govern themselves through their[[Page S1787]]elected representatives, and my accountability to them is the defining characteristic of my role as one of their representatives in the U.

So I am now going to turn to Senator I would like to have him discuss a question I put before him: How do you understand Judge Gorsuch to view differences between judges, legislators, and the executive under our Constitution?

But I think the principle is also a fundamental one. Judge Gorsuch has made this point himself, and I would like to quote a little of what he has said.  Recent Supreme Court cases ``permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design.''  To quote again, on the role of the prosecutor and the role of Congress, he said: ``If the separation of powers means anything, it must mean that the prosecutor isn't allowed to define the crimes that he gets to enforce.''[[Page S1788]]  So I want to ask my other colleague here for this colloquy, the Senator from Nebraska, a question that I am sure he can answer and has thought about a lot.

Senator Sasse and Senator Lee have laid out very clearly the Constitution's separation of powers, the proper role for judges, the proper role for Members of Congress, and when one can't interfere with the other. I think the Senator has laid out very clearly, and I agree, that Judge Gorsuch fits in very well with what judges are supposed to do, what the Supreme Court is supposed to do--obviously not legislate.

3240,topic-id,1943,"Mr.President, I rise today to once again address the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  I am extraordinarily pleased that the President has nominated such an outstanding individual to fill the seat that was held by my friend, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for nearly three decades.  In the weeks since Judge Gorsuch's nomination, I have done my best to make the case that he is exactly the kind of Justice that we need: one that will--in the timeless words of Marbury v. Madison--say what the law is, not what he wishes the law would be.  In my view, his outstanding credentials and his understanding of the proper role of a judge under our Constitution make him a choice that should command universal support. Unfortunately, this feeling does not appear to be as broadly shared as it should be.  Leftwing activists are demanding a scorched-earth approach to Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and I am afraid that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to have been swept up in this fervor. Their opposition stems from two different[[Page S1850]]sources and has taken two different forms.  The first cause is the visceral reaction among some to our new After last year's bitterly fought election campaign, many on the left simply refuse to accept the legitimacy of the new administration and are dead set on all-out opposition to every initiative, every policy, and every nominee of this As a case in point, we are in mid-March and the President is still waiting for the Senate to confirm his Cabinet nominees. This hasn't happened, to my knowledge, in the 40 years I have been in the  Skeptical of any nominee's willingness to hold the administration that nominated him accountable to the law, they are demanding assurances about how Judge Gorsuch would rule on the administration's most controversial moves.  The Supreme Court confirmation process should not be treated as just another forum to litigate the wisdom and lawfulness of the new administration's policies. Not only does such an approach distract from the proper focus on the nominee's qualifications and judicial philosophy, but it also threatens to undermine the very independence Democrats claim to want in a Supreme Court  As I have explained in detail as recently as last week, nominees of both parties for decades have refused to speculate on cases that may come before them in order to not prejudice their potential future judgments. Moreover, as a sitting Federal judge, Judge Gorsuch is bound by the code of conduct for United States judges, one of the canons of which prohibits a judge from making ``public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.''  In light of this longstanding, necessary, and, in Judge Gorsuch's case, legally mandated practice, I have found it extraordinarily disappointing to hear some of my colleagues try to turn on its head Judge Gorsuch's admirable efforts to protect his independence. For example, the minority leader has repeatedly castigated Judge Gorsuch for refusing to take a definitive stand on the legality of the new administration's policies, accusing him of ``avoiding answers like the plague.''  For those of us of all political stripes who want a Supreme Court Justice who decides cases on the basis of what the law commands, rather than whether the result serves a particular political or policy agenda--be it Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, pro-Trump or anti-Trump--Judge Gorsuch's refusal to prejudice his approach to future cases should be celebrated, not condemned.  As Justice Sotomayor said recently: ``Any self-respecting judge who comes in with an agenda that would permit that judge to tell you how they will vote is the kind of person you don't want as a judge.''  Put more colorfully, there is a plague threatening judicial independence; here, this plague takes the form of the minority leader's attempt to extract these sorts of inappropriate answers, and Judge Gorsuch is wise to avoid that. The minority leader should know better.  Moreover, we know the minority leader does know better, given his many years of service on the Judiciary Committee and, in particular, how he acquiesced to the same approach when now-Justices Sotomayor and Kagan were presented with similar timely hypotheticals during their confirmation processes.  Sadly, I have little doubt that this line of attack on Judge Gorsuch will continue to infect the confirmation process, but we should be completely clear and unambiguous about what these attempts to get Judge Gorsuch to answer hypothetical questions about the legality of the administration's policies represent. They are illegitimate, partisan attempts to derail his nomination, cleverly shrouded in a cloak of alleged concern about his independence. Americans should not be under any illusions that these proper concerns about independence amount to anything else.  To turn to the second source of opposition to Judge Gorsuch's nomination, one need only examine this week's New York Times heading, which blared: ``Democrats' Line of Attack on Gorsuch: No Friend of the Little Guy.''  This same theme has been repeated by various leftwing interest groups and by some of my colleagues here in the They should be ashamed. As I have explained extensively in the past, the judge's critics view the judiciary as simply an extension of politics, just another forum to relitigate battles that they lost in the policymaking process. In their view, the job of a judge is not to apply the law to the facts dispassionately, but rather to pick winners and losers on the basis of the political popularity of the litigants and the policy consequences of the decision.  While such an approach is antithetical to the role of a judge under the Constitution, it has become an entrenched article of faith for most of those on the left. As such, they have approached Judge Gorsuch's nomination in a predictable manner: cherry-picking and mischaracterizing his opinions as evidence of a political agenda with total disregard of what the law commanded in each of those cases.  Simply put, this line of attack on Judge Gorsuch is ludicrous. Any reasonable analysis of his opinions shows that his decisions apply to laws enacted by the people's elected representatives, without regard to his own personal preferences. His approach manifests the Constitution's vision of the appropriate role of a judge that has been prominently embraced by Justice Scalia: ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you are not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.''  Today, I want to examine just a few of the cases seized on by Judge Gorsuch's liberal critics to demonstrate just how unfounded their attacks are. Compass Environmental v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission involved a Tenth Circuit ruling against a firm for failing to provide adequate training to protect its employees from electric shock hazards. Judge Gorsuch did indeed rule in the firm's favor, but the case did not present the question of whether the company should do more to protect its workers. Rather, the case turned on the question of whether the Secretary of Labor satisfied the standard of showing any evidence to demonstrate that the firm in question was providing less training than what is the norm in the industry.  One need only examine the judge's opinion to understand how that specific legal burden was met, reaching the same conclusion as the administrative law judge below.  Next, Riddle v. Hickenlooper touches on one of the liberals' faith talking points: the supposed need to regulate political speech in order to fight money in politics. While this case has been characterized as some invitation for wealthy and large corporations to exert undue influence in politics, it actually turned on a rather narrow and technical question of whether a $200 disparity in the contribution limits for major party and write-in candidates for Colorado's State House of Representatives amounted to an equal protection violation.  Judge Gorsuch joined the majority opinion of his colleagues--an Obama appointee, by the way--in agreeing that it did constitute such a violation, and then wrote a brief concurrence outlining how unclear Supreme Court precedent was on this particular point.  Moreover, he stated how ``clear'' it was that ``with a little effort, Colorado could have achieved its stated policy objectives . . . without offending'' the  In essence, Judge Gorsuch adopted a particularly narrow position on a relatively minor issue in the grand scheme of campaign finance law, meriting none of his opponents' extrapolations about larger issues of political speech.  Finally, several of Judge Gorsuch's writings have called into question the so-called Chevron doctrine, under which Federal courts defer to administrative agencies' interpretations of the law. His opponents have seized on this skepticism to argue that Judge Gorsuch is somehow reflexively opposed to regulation. Nothing could be further from the truth.  These critics of Judge Gorsuch should recall that the Chevron deference first flourished as a reaction against liberal judges overturning the deregulatory actions of the Reagan administration. I myself am a skeptic of[[Page S1851]]Chevron and have led the fight to overturn it with my Separation of Powers Restoration But as the name of my legislation suggests, overturning Chevron is about restoring the constitutional allocation of powers between the three branches, maintaining fidelity to the text of the Administrative Procedure Act, and ensuring that the bureaucracy abides by the law no matter its policy goals.  These are a few of Judge Gorsuch's opinions that have been most prominently mischaracterized as driven by a political agenda, when in reality their results are demanded by the law. Sadly, I expect that these mischaracterizations and inappropriate demands of Judge Gorsuch will continue to appear in this confirmation process. They don't have any better arguments, and those arguments are not only flawed, but they are wrong and inappropriate.  Let me quote from a prominent liberal law professor, Harvard's Noah Feldman, to sum up how I think we all should feel about this strategy:       I'm not sure who decided that the Democratic critique of      U.Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch would be that      he doesn't side with the little guy. It's a truly terrible      idea. . . . [S]iding with workers against employers isn't a      jurisprudential position. It's a political stance. And      justices--including progressive justices--shouldn't decide      cases based on who the parties are. They should decide cases      based on their beliefs about how the law should be      interpreted.  That is a liberal law professor agreeing with me, really, and condemning these types of ad hominem attacks by people who know better or should know better.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to resist the temptation to give in to partisan and ideological pressure to engage in these tactics I described earlier, and I hope people will pay attention to what I have suggested. These are unworthy of the Senate's role, and they are unmerited with respect to such a stellar nominee as Judge Gorsuch, a man who is clearly committed to the proper, independent role of a judge.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in helping to ensure his speedy confirmation. This man is a decent, honorable, intelligent man who deserves the support of this decent, honorable, intelligent body.

3335,topic-id,760,"Mr.President, later today, the Senate will vote on H.42, the resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act relating to a Department of Labor regulation on the drug testing of unemployment insurance applicants. I rise to speak in support of that resolution and to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage.  Let's put this resolution and the regulation it would repeal in proper context. In 2012, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Among many other things, that law included a number of carefully negotiated provisions relating to the unemployment insurance program, including a number of reforms to address program efficiency and integrity issues.  One of those provisions overturned a DOL ban on drug screening for UI applicants. Specifically, the law allowed States to test UI applicants who either lost their job due to drug use or were seeking employment in an occupation that generally required drug tests as a condition of employment.  It did not require States to begin drug testing; it only gave them that option. In addition, the law required DOL to issue regulations to define those occupations that regularly conduct drug tests. States would not be allowed to implement any drug testing policies pursuant to the law until the regulations were finalized. DOL issued its proposed regulation in 2014.  At that time, Members of Congress and stakeholders at the State level argued that the proposal fell far short of Congress's intent. The final rule was issued in August of last year, about 4\1/2\ years after the provision was signed into law. As before, the final regulation defined the relevant occupations so narrowly that it basically makes it impossible for States to implement any meaningful drug testing policy.  So here we are, debating a CRA resolution that would wipe this regulation off the books and give DOL an opportunity to put forward something new that better reflects Congress's intent.  Let's talk about why this drug testing provision is important. The UI Program requires beneficiaries to be able and available to work and be actively seeking work. This is a condition of eligibility for UI benefits. This is what it boils down to. If a worker loses his or her job due to drug use, he or she cannot affirmatively establish that they are fully able to work. Likewise, if an unemployed individual is unable to accept a new job because they cannot pass a required drug test, they are not available for work.  Congress intended to give States the power to withhold benefits in these cases because, by definition, individuals in these situations are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.  Keep in mind that, according to recent surveys, more than half of all U.employers require prospective employees to take a drug test. It isn't some fringe or mean-spirited notion that there is a connection between the use of illegal drugs and the ability to obtain and maintain employment.  Furthermore, 20 States already limit UI benefits for applicants who have refused to take or who fail a drug test required by an employer or who have previous employment issues relating to drugs. The next logical step really is to allow States to conduct the tests themselves in order to maintain program integrity and to improve the solvency of their UI trust funds. Once again, that was what Congress intended with the passage of the 2012 statute.  Unfortunately, the Obama administration took it upon themselves to undo congressional intent. We have heard from a number of Governors on this issue--including the Governor of Utah, who will support this CRA resolution--who want to see new and better regulations.  A number of organizations, including the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, have chimed in as well, expressing their strong support for State flexibility in governing their UI programs.  Ultimately, that is what this is about--State flexibility. Do we want States to have the freedom to run their own programs as they see fit, or do we believe that bureaucrats in Washington have all the answers?  It is probably pretty clear where I come down on this particular issue. The law we drafted and passed in 2012--the one that passed with bipartisan support--struck a careful balance on these issues. It was the right balance and the right approach. Hopefully, a majority of our colleagues will share that view and vote today to restore that balance.  Once again, I urge all Senators to vote in favor of H.42.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING Will the Senator withhold?

3197,topic-id,944,"Madam President, as recently as 2006, Hawaii relied on imported fuel for 92 percent of our energy needs. This was bad for our economy and bad for our environment, and it needed to change. Today, Hawaii has the most ambitious renewable energy goals in the country, and we are working toward becoming 100 percent energy self-sufficient for electricity by 2045. In order to meet this ambitious goal, we are investing in a renewable energy future. It means cleaner air and water to enjoy, and it is driving a lot of local innovation. Let me give you a few examples.  Last Friday, I attended a blessing for a new biofuel project in Maui's central valley. Pacific Biodiesel, run by Bob and Kelly King, is repurposing 115 acres of land previously used for commercial sugar cultivation in order to test the energy potential of different sunflower varieties for biofuels. If they are successful, this project could grow to provide hundreds of jobs on the island and help Hawaii on its path to energy self-sufficiency.  Bob and Kelly got their start in repurposing used cooking oil. They have grown their company to run the Nation's first commercially viable biodiesel distillery on Hawaii Island, and they employ 80 people. Along the way, they have received support and funding through the Hawaii Military Biofuels Crop Program, which has allowed them to experiment, learn from their mistakes, and, ultimately, succeed.  Yesterday, I met with Naveen Sikka, the founder and CEO of TerViva, which is a startup that grows pongamia trees that produce an oil seed that can be used for biofuels. In working with Hawaii's Energy Excelerator, TerViva is already growing pongamia trees on 200 acres on Oahu and is looking to expand its operations across the  TerViva and Pacific Biodiesel are working together to explore how to help Hawaii achieve its renewable energy goals.  In 2015, I met with Global Algae Innovations, a company that is pioneering the production of algae for use in biofuels on Funding from the Department of Energy, or DOE, has been instrumental in its research. Support from the Department is vital in helping them and other algae biofuel companies finish scaling up commercial production at competitive prices.  These stories provide a compelling counternarrative to the President's belief that we should prioritize fossil fuel extraction over renewable energy development. These stories also demonstrate the role government can play in encouraging energy innovation.  During the Obama administration, our country made significant progress in confronting the challenge of climate change, investing in clean energy research and development, and growing our renewable energy economy. Unfortunately, by nominating Rick Perry to serve as Secretary of Energy, the President is sending a clear signal. Instead of continuing the progress we have made, he wants to take us backward.  During his confirmation hearing, Governor Perry insisted that he believed in an ``all of the above'' energy strategy. So far, it does not seem that the President shares his commitment.  During the transition, a disturbing report leaked in the media that outlined the President's plans to make dramatic funding cuts at the Department of This extreme plan included eliminating the DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, which focuses on the transition to American energy generation that is clean, affordable, and secure, not to mention sustainable. The plan would eliminate the DOE's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, which ensures the Nation's energy delivery system is secure, resilient, and reliable. This office works to strengthen the resiliency of the electric grid. The plan would also eliminate the DOE's Office of Fossil Energy, which focuses on technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  It is hard to see how it would be possible to pursue an ``all of the above'' energy strategy if so much of the Department's ``all of the above'' capabilities are eliminated.  I asked Governor Perry, during his confirmation hearing, whether he supported those proposed cuts and program eliminations within the Department that he was nominated to head. His response was telling. Governor Perry said: ``Well, Senator, maybe they'll [meaning the Trump administration] have the same experience I had and forget that they said that.''  Remember, Governor Perry had originally said that the Department of Energy should be eliminated. Governor Perry's ``oops'' answer got a laugh at the hearing, but it failed to convince me that he has the willingness and fortitude to stand up to the Trump White House on its energy policies.  I also asked Governor Perry if Hawaii could count on his support in our efforts to become energy independent and a leader in the clean energy economy. Again, Governor Perry said yes, but in the same transition memo, the Trump White House proposed eliminating the DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy entirely, as I mentioned before. It is unclear how Governor Perry could keep his commitment to the State of Hawaii and to me if the entire office that is responsible for renewable energy is eliminated.  Many of my constituents share my concerns about Governor Charlotte from Wailuku wrote to me:       Please do not confirm Rick Perry for US Secretary of      He is not a visionary leader. In Hawaii, we have      committed to being 100% carbon emission free by 2045.

According to a 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study, 1.8 million more cyber security professionals will be needed worldwide by 2022.  Data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management in 2015 highlighted the need for robust cyber security protections at the Federal level, which include a strong and skilled workforce. Since 2001, the Federal Government has operated a cyber security education program known as CyberCorps: Scholarship for Thanks to great leadership by Chairman John Thune and the U.Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Congress codified the CyberCorps Program as part of the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014.

Scholarship recipients must fulfill a service requirement in a federal, state or local government cyber security job upon graduation.

Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague Senator Roger Wicker, the Cybersecurity Scholarship Opportunities Act of 2017. This legislation will improve the federal cyber security workforce pipeline by directing the CyberCorps Program to provide 5 percent of scholarships to career changers and military veterans at qualified 2-year programs with no transfer requirement. The bill would also codify CyberCorps' K-12 education program and align the skills required for scholarship eligibility with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education  In addition, the bill would enhance cyber security protection for critical infrastructure by allowing CyberCorps graduates, on a case-by-case basis, to meet their service requirements in critical infrastructure missions at government-affiliated entities like the Tennessee Valley Just today, a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that digital threats to U.critical infrastructure demand attention and that the Nation does not produce enough graduates with the skills to protect critical infrastructure. It recommended that the President take steps to increase the supply of skilled professionals. By allowing CyberCorps graduates to fulfill service obligations in critical infrastructure missions, this legislation represents an important step in the right direction.  The Cybersecurity Scholarship Opportunities Act is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would help students succeed and strengthen our national security. There are cyber security jobs in Virginia and across the country that are going unfilled, and it is clear we must make it easier for students to access the programs that prepare them for these roles.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2049.txt,2176,STRANGER THINGS,2017.0,28.0,January
3132,topic-id,248,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the nearly 50 million baby boomers about to retire. It is National Retirement Planning Week, and before I get to the importance of this effort, let me say, there are no more important foundational programs that sustain our seniors and retirees than Medicare and Social These earned benefits are critical, as nearly half of all baby boomers saved nothing for their retirement.  Thank you to Representative John Larson from Connecticut for introducing the Social Security 2100 Act, which protects and strengthens Social Security for decades to come. I have long been an advocate for protecting workers' pensions, and, sadly, more Americans than ever before are shouldering the burden of financing retirement alone.  That is why we need a national conversation on retirement planning, and Congress should lead it. Far too many seniors find Social Security is simply not enough to live on. America must preserve Social Security, protect retirement accounts and pensions, and work with our constituents to make sure they have the resources they need to have a dignified retirement.  Thank you to the National Retirement Planning Coalition, whose fantastic online resources are available to all Americans free of charge. Let's get to work for our retirees.  In closing, let me also say hardiest congratulations to Congressman Steve Stivers from the great State of Ohio, who has been just promoted to brigadier general in the Ohio National Onward, Steve We are very proud of you on a bipartisan basis.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2707-4.txt,616,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,5.0,March
3158,topic-id,1368,"I thank the gentleman so very much for taking the time, after formal votes have occurred today, to help us enlighten the American people on what is really at stake here.  I have to say, President Trump carried the State of Ohio by about 450,000 votes out of all the votes that were cast. And there was this slim hope, I think, on behalf of some of the people who voted for him, that though he was a billionaire, that there was perhaps a kind heart that would minister to the people of our country, helping them get more jobs, helping them deal with their everyday challenges, including health care.  Unfortunately, this bill is cruel, and it is dangerous. It helps the billionaire class. Why in heaven's name, of the people that are drafting this bill on the Republican side of the aisle, would they be giving billions and billions and billions of tax giveaways to the wealthiest people in our country; to those that, frankly, if you take away a couple of million, they wouldn't miss it anyway. You know, when you have that much money, normal life is kind of distant from your world.  But what TrumpCare is giving to the rank and file, people are going to have to pay more for less coverage, and millions and millions of people are going to lose their coverage completely.  Now, you know, 75 percent of the people who go bankrupt in this country go bankrupt because of health bills that they can't pay for. And so when you start tinkering around with people's health insurance and their coverage, you are playing with wildfire, and that is what is happening on the Republican side of the aisle.  Now, it used to be that most Americans received their health insurance through employment, just like in We had an employment-based health insurance system. I like that system. I like for workers to share in the profits of the companies that they help make money for.  But what has been happening over the years, with so much outsourcing that Wall Street is more than happy to finance, right, companies are plucked up from Ohio and put in Mexico, put in China, put in all these other places around the world. People lose their health insurance. They lose everything. They are lucky if they can hang on to their houses.  Then what happens? What happens to them? Well, if they are lucky, they might get a job that pays a third of what they earned before in a company that doesn't pay health insurance.  Take Walmart, the biggest employer in the country. Go take a look at their employees and what happens. What is happening is the corporations are throwing on to the back of the public sector, the Federal Government, the responsibility to pay for health insurance. So all the profits that Walmart makes, it doesn't benefit the workers there with any health insurance. The companies have ceded their responsibility to provide health insurance as a condition of employment, and they have transferred that to, guess what, the taxpayer. So what is going on here is a big shift in responsibility.  The Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan, and the head of it is a Republican, I might say, but it is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that with TrumpCare, next year alone, 14 million fewer Americans will have health insurance.  Some of those currently on the Affordable Care will drop off, and I am very worried about the 900,000 Ohioans who were finally able to get insurance, some of whom work for Walmart, some of whom work for small employers who couldn't afford health insurance, some of them who worked for big corporations that spit them out when they moved and outsourced their jobs, that[[Page H2284]]they are going to be among these numbers.  We are told by 2020, 21 million people will lose their coverage in the country; 24 million by 2026, and perhaps the total number of uninsured Americans rising to reach 52 million. That is going backwards.  In this bill, they expect 70 million people who are currently on Medicaid--all right, guess what? They are in nursing homes.  The Republican Party always says they are the pro-life party. This is an anti-life bill. This is going to cost illness and death across this country.  Here is a story already in my district in A man named Joseph is self-employed, and he used to get his insurance from his wife's employer. Thank God she had employer-provided health insurance. She retired, and now the family faced a choice, forced upon them by the Republican leaders in Congress and President  They faced the threat of no health coverage, so Joseph heard all this debate here. He wasn't sure what was going to happen to him in this fiscal year of 2017, so his choice was to go on the healthcare exchange and risk losing coverage if the Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act and pull the rug out from under him; or he could opt for the guarantee of 18 months of expensive COBRA insurance. So he opted for the expensive choice of COBRA, which cost him and his family hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars in additional costs per month, and he is putting off a knee replacement because of the uncertainty even consideration of this bill is causing.  Don't tell me that this isn't cruel and dangerous. And this family isn't the only one in America that is facing that kind of terrible health choice.  The TrumpCare proposal in States like Ohio, where we have a lot of rural counties, we are going to have hundreds of thousands of people out of work, nurses, long-term care aides.  I just had people from Hospice in my office this afternoon, and we were talking about home-health care for Hospice patients versus institutional care, the rising numbers of Vietnam veterans coming into Hospice facilities.  Well, guess what? Who is going to pay for all of that in the TrumpCare? These people will be dropped. They will say to the States: well, we will give you a little bit of money, but we will cap the money, you know.  And then what happens after 2020? Hey, it is like dropping you out of an airplane with no parachute. Good luck.  We can't do this. This is a death bill. This is a death knell for the American people. We can't allow the American people to be treated in this manner. So we ought to be repairing and fixing and looking in the windshield, not the rearview mirror of where we need to take health insurance in this country, but not put so many millions, ten and tens of millions of Americans at risk, and doling out--Congressman Garamendi, maybe you could repeat those numbers--over $600 billion in tax giveaways to the richest people in this country, many of whom caused the financial crash of 2008. They owe the They owe the people of this Republic for what they did.  I have families in my district still underwater on their mortgages, if they were able to hang on to their homes at all.  The wealthy of this country, starting with Wall Street, owe the American people a lot. And all those employers who abandoned their responsibilities and pushed the cost of health insurance on the public sector because they didn't have the decency to help ensure their own workers, well, shame on you. Shame on you.  For all the small businesses that finally got health insurance through this program, thank you for respecting your workers. Thank you for respecting the Affordable Care  We can do a whole lot better than And I really feel sorry that this new President, for whom many of the people in Ohio voted, doled up this kind of a flawed piece of legislation that is cruel and, honestly, will result in so many more illnesses across this country, because people worry about health insurance. They worry about the affordability of health insurance.  Congressman Garamendi, thank you so very much for having this Special Order this evening and for inviting me to participate.

Known fondly by millions simply as Mr.Rogers, his wonderful, beloved presence has reached millions of homes across our Nation captivating generations of children, and even adults.  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a vital part of America, including cities, but small towns as well. NPR and PBS stations will be disproportionately impacted by President Trump's proposed budget zeroing out public broadcasting. It is not right.  President Trump's travel bill to Mar-a-Lago and the growing security that the American people are paying for over at his Trump Tower in New York, which reports show to already be in the tens of millions of dollars, will soon swamp the $200 million America dedicates to public broadcasting annually.  We have been here before. In 1969, President Richard Nixon threatened to slash funding for Mr.Rogers went before the Senate to defend public broadcasting and its value to our children, especially for learning.

As someone who has been involved in cybersecurity policy for the better part of a decade, it could not be morerelevant, it could not be more timely.  During the past year, Mr.Speaker, the core of our democracy came under attack. The Russian Government, acting under theorders of authoritarian President Vladimir Putin, conducted a sustained information warfare campaign designed to undermine theAmerican people's faith in our electoral system. The influence operation involved traditional tradecraft, including Russianstate-owned media broadcasters. It also, notably and notoriously, involved the hacking of Democratic Party organizations,including the Democratic National  These are facts, Mr.They are the findings of independent security researchers that have been recently confirmed bythe brave men and women serving their country as part of the intelligence community for whom I have great respect. The contoursof what happened are indisputable, and they should be undisputed.  Yet, our response to this unprecedented attack has been anything but unified. Putin and his henchmen acted with an intent tosow discord, to make us question each other's motives, and to raise doubt about the validity of our election results. We knowthis was Putin's intent, and yet, rather than acting with solidarity to address the problem, we bicker.

Mr.Trump may not have been my choice for President, but, come next week, he will nonetheless be my I willjoin with my colleagues here, and we will congratulate him on his inauguration. We will do so because there is no evidence thatany vote tallies were altered and, like it or not, Mr.Trump clearly prevailed in the electoral college.  But if we can join together on the election of the President, something many of my colleagues have severe disagreementsabout, why can we not do so to decry Putin's attempted interference? Why do we not speak today as a body with one voice to say:you've failed, Mr.Putin; our faith in our democracy is as strong as ever?

President Obama spoke very eloquently on Tuesday about the challenges faced by our democracy. ``Our democracy isthreatened,'' he said, ``whenever we take it for granted.''

I think everybody would agree he has to recuse himself. Of course, as this goes on, the question now arises: Has he perjured himself?  In response to these reports, the Attorney General claims that he ``never met Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.'' That is a wholly inadequate response. The Attorney General was a top adviser to the Trump campaign. He took a private, undisclosed meeting with the Russian Ambassador during the height of concerns about Russian involvement in our election. Think about it. There are reports everywhere about concerns about Russian involvement in the election of the United States, and he has an undisclosed meeting with the Russian  He also met with the Russian Ambassador during an event at the Republican National One would think, at the Republican National Convention, it is possible that politics might be discussed. Now, if the Attorney General thinks his explanation is sufficient after he misled Congress about these contacts, of course, he is mistaken. I don't say that as a I think everybody would agree to that. What I worry about is that the Attorney General is only the latest Trump administration official who has attempted to mask his contacts with the  The President's first National Security Advisor lied to the Vice President about his communications with the Russian He only resigned after the media reported how he had lied to Vice President Pence, and even that was weeks after the President had been informed. He had to leave only when it became public. The President's Chief of Staff attempted to use the FBI--which, of course, would be in violation of Justice Department policies--to suppress news reports about Russian contacts. I have been here through seven previous Presidents--Republicans and You would assume they would play by the rules. This administration seems to want to make up the rules.  My concern is not just what the administration might be doing; my concern is about We are, I believe strongly, the greatest democracy history has known. We are the longest existing democracy in history, and now we have Russia meddling and trying to undermine our democracy. Every American should worry about that. Every American should be frightened, not just concerned but frightened. It is an attack on our democracy. This is one of the most disturbing national security challenges facing our country. Russian President Putin ordered a multifaceted campaign that was aimed at helping Donald Trump win and undermining public faith in our election. That should alarm and outrage everybody no matter what party one belongs to.  We didn't hear a word about it in the President's speech on Tuesday during the joint session of In fact, the President's only reaction has been to disparage American investigators, to disparage the intelligence community, to cast journalists who report on this as ``enemies of the American people.'' Journalists are not enemies of the American people. Russia is the enemy of the American people. Putin is the enemy of the American people. Do not cast our journalists, do not cast our investigators, do not cast our intelligence people, do not cast those who dare speak out as being enemies of Point to the real enemies--Vladimir Putin and those he controls.  It is about time we take this seriously. I have been here 42 years. I have never seen such a perfidious threat to our democracy than what we are seeing in Vladimir Putin, and my concern is the administration does not call it out for what it is. We Americans deserve to know the facts. We deserve a full and fair investigation. We deserve one that is free from any political influence.  I have repeatedly called on Attorney General Sessions, who was one of President Trump's top advisers during the campaign, to recuse himself and appoint a special counsel to conduct the investigation. Earlier this week, he said: ``I would recuse myself on anything that I should recuse myself on.'' This morning, he said he would recuse himself ``whenever it's appropriate.'' This would be a ludicrous response from a law clerk at the Department of From the Attorney General, it is dissembling.  Recusal is not optional here. It is required by very clear Justice Department regulations. It is required to maintain at least a semblance of integrity in this investigation. The Attorney General has to recuse himself because, as stated clearly in Department rules, he is obviously ``closely identified'' with the President due to his ``service as a principal adviser.'' That is the rule, and that is the rule whether it is a Republican or a Democratic administration. It describes his relationship with the  The investigation has to be led by someone who, in reality and in appearance, is impartial and removed from politics. That does not describe someone who was in the trenches of a political campaign with the subjects of the investigation while they were allegedly engaged in the very activity under investigation. It does not describe somebody who misled Congress--who misled the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee--about his own activities that have been implicated in the investigation.  This is not a close call. We know Russia is doing everything to undermine our democracy. Let's stand up for Let's do what is best for our country. The Attorney General should start by stepping aside. Then what we need is an independent investigation, and we need answers.  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska for her indulgence.  I yield the floor.

The Secretary and the Department of Interior are tasked with using sound science to manage and sustain America's lands, water, wildlife, and energy resources, while honoring our Nation's vital obligations and responsibilities to tribal nations. The Secretary of Interior also coordinates Federal assistance to the Freely Associated States of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau under the Compacts of Free There are few Cabinet positions with such a wide range of management and organization.  Any nominee for this position should be selected for their commitment to protecting our precious resources, as well as their dedication to uphold and enforce our environmental laws.  After reviewing Mr.Zinke's record, there is little doubt that he is dedicated to public service and that he has a strong connection to the outdoors. However, the Secretary of the Interior has a great responsibility as the leading steward of our majestic public lands, the champion of our great tribal nations, and the manager and defender of our diverse wildlife. I fear that Mr.Zinke may not be fully prepared to set aside some of his personal views on the management of our resources and consider the views of all Americans as we debate critical natural resources issues.  I enjoyed learning that Mr.Zinke is an admirer of President Teddy Roosevelt, a point that has been repeated countless times, and I was pleased that he agrees that, yes, President Roosevelt did get it right when he placed millions of acres of lands under Federal protection. However, I hope that Mr.Zinke will not only study the work that President Roosevelt did to instill a conservation ethic in this country, but will look more broadly at other individuals whose steadfast commitment and dedication to conservation and historic preservation have left their mark in Vermont and across the country.  For instance, Laurance Rockefeller made significant contributions to the American conservation movement that had a lasting impact on the American landscape. The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in Woodstock, VT, honors not only Rockefeller's dedication to conservation, but is also the first national park to tell the story of conservation history and the evolving nature of land stewardship in Conservation of the environment and recreational development was a passion to which he dedicated his life. In addition to his work in Vermont, he was instrumental in the creation and development of the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming and the Virgin Islands National Park on the island of These three national parks could not be more different, but they are each spectacular pieces of our natural heritage. This heritage that would not exist today and be available for the public to enjoy, had it not been for the vital work of Laurance Rockefeller and the Federal investments that have been made in these important public lands.  I hope Mr.Zinke will also study and hopefully visit the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, which carves its way not only through Vermont, but 13 other States as well. This trail is an amazing footpath for the people that traverses over 2,100 miles through wild forests, towns, valleys, and mountaintops, and connects a myriad of through-hikers and day hikers to our scenic landscape. All of them are able to enjoy the important Federal investments in this trail, which is maintained by the countless hours of work done every year by devoted volunteers like the Green Mountain Club in  Work to build and maintain the Appalachian Trail is not static, nor is it complete. There continue to be important investments needed through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, to acquire land and conservation easements to safeguard the trail. There is much needed trail maintenance that should be included as part of any infrastructure bill the Senate considers. This work is shovel-ready and will have a considerable impact in supporting our outdoor economy on which Vermont is so dependent.  Mr.Zinke should also seek out expertise and guidance from the past Secretaries of the Interior who have dedicated their lives to this work. I hope he will study the exit memo that Secretary Jewell prepared on the Department's Record of Progress and the moral imperative the Department has to positively impact our American economy, our rural communities and cities, and ultimately, the well-being of our planet.  As Secretary of Interior, Mr.Zinke will oversee a number of ongoing debates concerning our fragile public lands, the protection of endangered species, and how we respond to climate change. I know that there is no single solution that can answer the different land management issues facing each region of our country. Many stakeholders are constantly engaging the Interior Department and the Senate with a wide variety of views on how we should protect, access, and use our natural resources. In Vermont, we are deeply concerned about the pressure being placed on our natural resources from rapid growth and climate change.  I heard from hundreds of Vermonters concerned about Mr.Zinke's nomination and worried that our environmental standards and laws will not be enforced for our lands, air, water, and threatened species under his leadership. His record has shown an opposition to policies that protect valuable rivers and streams from polluting coal runoff and a willingness to weaken historic laws such as President Teddy Roosevelt's Antiquities He even authored a bill that sought to obstruct efforts by the Department of the Interior to review and modernize management of our Federal energy resources and ensure that taxpayers are fairly compensated for their sale. Taxpayers deserve a Secretary of the Interior who will work to support the protection of our shared Federal resources 100 percent of the time, not one who will actively work to weaken or dismantle the powers of protection invested in this  Based on that record, I voted against his nomination. Nonetheless, now that Mr.Zinke is the Secretary, I want him to know that I am committed to working closely with him on a variety of issues that are important to Vermonters and all I will work with him to foster consensus not only in New England, but throughout the country. As the Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I am committed to working with him to ensure that we protect our Federal lands and continue the important conservation ethic of Teddy Roosevelt to permanently protect our beautiful and fragile natural resources, while also addressing new challenges posed by climate change.  Madam President, with respect to the nomination of Rick Perry to be the Secretary of the Department of Energy, hundreds of Vermonters have written to me in opposition. They were concerned that under his leadership we will halt the forward progress we have made towards a responsible energy strategy for the future of our country. Not only did Governor Perry make headlines for famously proposing to abolish the Department of Energy, he lacks a background or any true experience on the complex scientific and technical issues in the Department of Energy's portfolio. This agency must be focused on addressing our energy and environmental challenges through transformative science and technology solutions; yet Mr.Perry expedited the permitting of coal-fired electric generating plants and filed suit challenging[[Page S1558]]the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases significantly endanger public health. How can we trust him to lead the Energy Department?  I was pleased that, during his confirmation hearing, Governor Perry apologized for suggesting that the entire Department of Energy should be abolished. However, he has yet to say that he will fight to maintain important offices within the Department, such as the Office of Electricity and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable I find it hard to see how we can pursue an ``all-of-the-above'' energy strategy called for by the administration if so much of the Department's capabilities are targeted for elimination. By supporting research around wind, solar, and efficiency, offering loan guarantees for innovative demonstration projects, and providing expertise and support to the private sector in commercializing new research we can create American jobs and grow the national economy. Conversely, if we turn our back on the future, we are ceding these important and fast growing fields of research and production of renewable energy technologies to China, the European Union, and other countries at a critical time. That would be a monumental mistake to haunt our economy for many years.  Earlier today, I had the chance to talk to a Vermont company that is closely watching the work of the Energy Dpartment to advance America's clean energy revolution. Northern Power Systems in Barre, VT, has been designing and developing wind turbines for almost 40 years and offers support services for energy generation needs around the world. Last year, they received an award for their increase in exports, but rather than selling to an international market they would rather see their sales here in the U.take off so that they can create more American jobs to manufacture American-made wind turbines. Turbines that should be installed here to utilize this reliable, abundant, and free resource to lower energy costs for  It is troubling that Mr.Perry has taken such an aggressive stance against the Department of Energy and dismissed large parts of its mission. I hope that he will devote himself to learning everything he can about the diverse work of the Department and surround himself with some of the best public servants and technical experts he can find.  The last Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, prepared two documents that I am hopeful Mr.Perry will study closely. First, the Quadrennial Energy Review provides a broad review of federal energy policy in the context of economic, environmental, occupational, security, and health and safety priorities. The Department also prepared an extensive suite of analyses to accompany the Quadrennial Energy Review that I know would serve Mr.Perry well as he tries to understand the wide array of issues that will come before him at the  I would also recommend that he review the exit memo Secretary Moniz prepared, which highlights the responsibilities and opportunities for the Department's enduring service to the Nation as our leading science, technology, and innovation agency. The Department has an extraordinary span of responsibilities from energy and the environment, to cyber security, science and national security, and it must collaborate with other agencies like the Defense Department and our intelligence community.  I remain committed to supporting and protecting the essential mission of the Department of Energy in order to move us forward with 2lst century jobs and make needed investments in our electricity grid, clean energy, and energy efficiency that will save American consumers and businesses money.

3265,topic-id,369,"Mr.Speaker, first, let me thank Congressman Davis for yielding and for his tireless advocacy on behalf of the most vulnerable everywhere.  I rise in strong opposition to H.42, which is really another baseless attack on the poor, on low-income individuals, and on the unemployed. Drug testing unemployed individuals is downright wrong.  Let me be clear. This resolution is another way for Republicans to stop[[Page H1205]]workers from claiming their right to unemployment benefits. It also is a scare tactic that flies in the face of facts.  First, there is no evidence that people who receive public assistance use drugs any more frequently than those in the general population. Unemployment compensation, mind you, is not public assistance.  By unnecessarily drug testing jobless workers, we are throwing them out in the cold when they are simply trying to get back on their feet.  Mr.Speaker, workers receive unemployment benefits because they worked hard, they played by the rules, and they were laid off through no fault of their own.  More importantly, working people have earned their right to apply for these benefits. They pay into the program. Their constitutional rights should not be violated.  I also know that people want to work. People don't want to be on unemployment insurance. They want to provide for themselves and their families.  Let me remind you, there is an opioid and heroin drug epidemic in this country, and it not only affects Democrats, this drug crisis is affecting Republicans, Independents--everyone. Yet, once again, you are throwing them out in the cold.  Instead of passing this appalling resolution--and this resolution is appalling--we should be expanding job training, unemployment benefits for all, and provide resources for drug treatment. It is hard to believe that you want to punish people. That is what this resolution really does. It punishes people for working. That is really a shame and disgrace.  So I strongly oppose this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I also urge you to encourage people to work, to provide those job training resources and drug abuse resources for our mental health centers, for our drug counseling centers, and for everyone who needs treatment rather than drug testing to keep them from getting a job.

3321,topic-id,1034,"I thank Senator The Senator's question really cuts to the heart of the issue. It cuts to the heart of the very reasons why we have an independent judiciary and exactly why it is that our system of government that operates under the U.Constitution depends so critically on individuals just like Judge It depends on people like Judge Gorsuch sitting on the Federal bench.  There are, I believe, two fundamental differences between the judiciary on the one hand and the two political branches on the other hand; that is, the two branches in which people serve after being elected to office, meaning the legislative branch where we work, and the executive branch headed by the  First, the legislative and executive powers sweep far more broadly than does the judicial power. Article I enumerates a list of lawmaking powers that are granted to Congress, and article II vests executive power in the By comparison, the judiciary's power is far more circumscribed. It is far more limited.  The judiciary has the power to decide only a limited and defined set of disputes--those that qualify as cases and controversies under article III of the To be clear, in the context of deciding a particular case, the judiciary has the power to invalidate an act put in place by the elected branches of government--the power to say what the law is, as Chief Justice John Marshall explained it in the landmark case Marbury v.  But that power is limited. It is limited, among other things, by article III of the Constitution and by jurisdictional requirements like standing and mootness and ripeness as explained in greater detail by Supreme Court precedent.  The judiciary's authority to say what the law is points to the second major difference between the courts on the one hand and the political branches on the other. While the function of the judiciary is an exercise in reasoned judgment, the functions of the executive and legislative branches are exercises of power.  There are many ways in which the Constitution and the political theory underlying it limit the exercise of that power. The Constitution protects minority rights, and it conditions the exercise of legislative or executive power on winning elections, and that, in turn, means winning the trust of the American people--of the voters throughout the country.  These twin ideas--the consent of the governed and the protection of minority rights within an essentially majority-rule system--are pillars of our constitutional order. But make no mistake, coercion underlies the laws that we make in this body and their enforcement by the executive branch.  By contrast, the judicial function is ultimately an exercise in reasoned judgment. As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 78: ``neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment'' are exercised by the judiciary. This is the essential difference between the judiciary and the other branches: The judiciary exercises judgment while all the rest of us exercise will.  The Framers, of course, understood this well. And as Hamilton continued in his explanation of Federalist 78:       Courts must declare the sense of the law, and if they      should be disposed to exercise Will instead of Judgment, the      consequence would equally be the substitution of their      pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if      it proves anything, would prove that there ought to be no      judges distinct from that body.  Put another way, a judge who chooses to exercise will instead of judgment is no longer acting as a judge. That person is instead functioning essentially as a superlegislator.  It should be clear to all fair-minded people that Judge Gorsuch is someone--and has established himself as someone--who understands these distinctive features of the Federal judiciary. When you read his opinions, you see that his only agenda is to understand the governing law and then to apply that law to the set of facts in the case before him.  As we will see next week during his confirmation hearings, his opinions carefully analyze the statutes and applicable precedents to determine the outcome of each and every case. In some cases, that means Judge Gorsuch reaches results that Senator Gorsuch or President Gorsuch or King Gorsuch probably wouldn't choose, were he deciding cases in any of those capacities. But Judge Gorsuch understands, of course, that he is a judge and not a king and not a President, not a Senator, not a Congressman, and he understands that this means his only job is to adjudicate cases based on the law according to the facts before him. As he said the night he was nominated: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge--stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.''  When you examine his record, you see that one of the defining characteristics of Judge Gorsuch is his independence--his judicial independence. That is distinctively the hallmark of a good judge. You see that he decides cases based on the law, not based on the parties before him and not based on his own political or ideological preferences.  In the coming weeks, some of our colleagues may try to argue that Judge Gorsuch hasn't done enough to prove his independence since being nominated to the Supreme If this criticism is raised against him, it will be a weak one. It will be one that doesn't apply here. The fact is that Judge Gorsuch has spent his entire career as a judge, and as a lawyer before that, proving his independence.  To his would-be critics, I would say, read and analyze his opinions. They speak for him. They speak for themselves. They speak for the rule of law. Study his approach to judging. Listen to what he says about judicial independence and, just as importantly, look at his actions. His actions prove his independence.  I have done these things. I have examined Judge Gorsuch's record. And on that basis, I am confident that he will not hesitate to apply the law appropriately in every case. There is absolutely no reason--no reason that I can find anywhere in his record--to prove otherwise.  I think I have only scratched the surface here today. I look forward to hearing Judge Gorsuch's testimony before the Judiciary Committee next week.  ",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,1501,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,14.0,March
3263,topic-id,513,"Mr.Speaker, at the onset of the Great Recession, our unemployment insurance system was completely inadequate. Democrats took the lead, against increasing Republican opposition, to improve the system and to provide unemployment benefits to Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The result was an emergency Federal unemployment compensation program which helped more than 24 million people.  Research from a broad array of experts shows these Federal UI benefits, in combination with State-provided benefits, saved more than 2 million jobs, prevented 1.4 million home foreclosures, and kept an estimated 5 million Americans out of poverty. In short, a strong unemployment insurance system helped prevent the Great Recession from turning into another Great  Today, our unemployment insurance system is again inadequate and totally unprepared to respond to a future recession; and once again, rather than stepping up with solutions, Republicans' answer to working people is a cold shoulder. Instead of responding to the deterioration of our unemployment insurance system, Republicans today want to shame and blame Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, while also violating their constitutional rights.  Here are the real problems this legislation completely ignores:  Number one, only one out of every four jobless Americans now receives unemployment benefits, near a record all-time low.  Two, eight States have cut back on the maximum number of weeks of benefits available for unemployed workers, including my home State of  Three, the value of UI benefits has declined over time, with 30 States now having maximum UI benefits that are less than half of the State's average weekly wage.  Four, the triggers for the federally funded Extended Benefits program, EB, are extremely out of date, so they do not turn on when unemployment begins to rise significantly.  Five, our Nation's UI system is underfunded, with only 18 States' funds reaching a minimum level of adequate solvency, according to a 2016 DOL report.  Six, the Federal UI trust funds, which support extended benefits during downturns in the economy, have a deficit of over $8 billion, hurt by the majority's decision to allow part of the revenue stream to those funds to expire in 2011.  Seven, our spending on workforce development as a percentage of GDP is now only one-seventh of its 1979 peak; and since 2010, Republicans in Congress have cut workforce education programs by $400 million. So we are doing less to help the unemployed while they look for work and less to help them prepare for a new job.  Today's bill ignores these problems completely and, instead, attempts to demean those needing help. In discouraging access to unemployment benefits, it reminds me of a massive problem we have uncovered in Michigan that involved at least 20,000--and perhaps many more--UI claimants being wrongly accused of fraud and ordered to pay huge penalties.  We should be focusing today on ensuring our UI system is ready for the great challenge, not to mention helping Americans who are seeking work right now.

3089,topic-id,551,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Smith, for his continued leadership on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and for bringing forward this important legislation.  H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, prioritizes improving weather forecasting for the protection of lives and property at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric This is a core program of the agency that has been in need of improved direction and investment for years.  The bill directs NOAA to develop plans to restore our country's leadership in weather forecasting. It is no secret that many people in our weather community are distraught that our forecasting capacities have deteriorated in recent years. Some even say that America no longer has the best weather prediction system in the world. In fact, we routinely rely on forecasts of other countries to predict what will happen in this country. This[[Page H2665]]is unacceptable, but I am glad we are here today to pass legislation that will dramatically improve our weather forecasting system.  The bill before us today enhances our ability to predict severe weather by focusing research and computing resources on improved weather forecasting, quantitative observing data planning, next generation modeling, and an emphasis on research-to-operations technology transfer.  As a Representative from Oklahoma, I understand the need for accurate and timely weather predictions firsthand. Every year, the loss of life from deadly tornadoes in my home State are a stark reminder that we can do better to predict severe weather events and provide longer lead times to protect Americans in harm's way.  I am proud that this legislation has a dedicated tornado warning improvement program. The goal of this program is to reduce the loss of life from tornadoes by advancing the understanding of fundamental meteorological science. This will allow detection and notifications of severe weather that are more accurate, effective, and timely. Constituents in my home State will benefit greatly from longer tornado warning lead times, which will save lives and better protect property.  Being better prepared for severe weather events is of the utmost important. The bill will improve our forecasting by encouraging innovations and new technologies through a joint technology transfer fund at NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric This transfer is essential to get new forecasting, models, and technologies out of the research side of NOAA and into the operational forecasts to better protect our country.  Furthermore, the legislation will enhance our forecasting by directing NOAA to engage new commercial data and private sector solutions. This legislation includes a pilot project, which will provide NOAA a clear demonstration of the valuable data from commercial technologies. The private sector has the potential to aid our forecasting skill while reducing government cost with innovative solutions. In order to increase our weather skills, we must not limit ourselves by solely relying on government data.  This legislation packs in multiple efforts to protect lives and property from severe weather. From encouraging new technologies both inside and outside of NOAA to the careful planning and prioritization of weather research, this legislation will put our country back on track to be a world leader in weather prediction.  The time has come for Americans to have the most accurate and timely weather predictions. They deserve nothing less.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill.

3102,topic-id,951,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for Georgia for yielding.  I am so proud to be here today. Before I talk about my district, I just want to say thanks to my fellow freshman class. I am so grateful to be part of the freshman class of the 115th Congress--a freshman class that includes 10 Members with military experience, a sheriff's officer, an FBI agent, two physicians, a dentist, and the rest of the class being mostly businessmen and businesswomen full of real-life experiences, which helps us solve problems with some little common sense.  As my family and I traveled our district of Kansas this last 2 years, traveling 30,000 miles, they constantly identified the three common problems. They were concerned about the economy, national security, and health care.  The first 2 years of those travels, I listened a lot. The last 6 months, I focused on solutions. I thought I would share today some of the common solutions that my classmates and I have talked about, as well as my constituents back home.  First of all, as far as the economy goes, the number one problem with the economy is government overregulation. Overregulation creates uncertainty and consolidation. When there is uncertainty, businesses don't grow; they don't invest.  The overregulation creates consolidations. So instead of having three or four community banks in town, consolidation forces there to be only one bank. Oftentimes, those single banks no longer even make bank loans to people from their own community. Consolidation has occurred in hospitals and with physician practices as well, all too often.  I am so proud to stand up here today and hear that the Senate also approved one of the laws we have passed repealing regulations. We think, as we go down this path, repealing regulation will be a continued path for small businesses to grow. That is where 80 percent of our future job growth is going to come from: small businesses.  It is hard to believe, when I talk about national security, that men and women who live 1,300 miles inland from the nearest ocean, separated by mountains and rivers, are concerned about their own safety.  It is hard to imagine that before there was the Paris massacre or San Bernardino or Orlando that my constituents in Kansas were concerned about national security. I stand beside our President in making our border secure and working through immigration and refugee issues to make our Nation more secure. We think that is vitally important, and that is one of the reasons we elected this President and many, many people from my class as well.  Lastly, I want to talk about health care, something very near and dear to my heart.  For the past 6 years, I have lived the nightmare of It has caused many, many physicians I know to quit, to give it up. ObamaCare has reduced us to data entry positions rather than[[Page H921]]physicians who can listen and develop their clinical skills as we try to work with patients to solve their healthcare problems.  ObamaCare has led to consolidation of physician practices. It has led to high prices as well for insurance products. It has led to $12,000 deductibles for most families. It is no longer affordable. It is like having no insurance at all.  Eighty percent of Americans are not happy with the Affordable Care Act, but I want to assure the American public and my constituents that, for every 5 seconds I have spent thinking about repeal, I have spent 5 days thinking about replace.  Though quite often the press wants to talk about this as two separate books, this is one book in my life--a book of repealing and replacing as quickly and efficiently as possible.  I want to assure all my constituents back home that, if you are on an ObamaCare product right now, we are not pushing you off any cliff. We are going to give you a period of transition where you can have a truly affordable healthcare product that works for you without a $6,000 or $12,000 deductible.  We are a party of solutions.

3189,topic-id,1539,"Mr.President, the matter pending before the Senate this morning is the nomination of Rick Perry to be Secretary of Energy, and I have come to the floor to speak to that nomination.  As with Representative Zinke, whom we confirmed to be Secretary of the Interior just yesterday, I am equally proud to support Governor Perry's nomination. I know colleagues from both sides of the aisle will be joining me as we make statements in support of this individual to our new President's  Before that though, here's a little bit on Governor Perry's background. He is one who has devoted his life--literally decades of his life--to public service. After graduating from Texas A&M, he joined the U.Air He piloted C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe as well as in the Middle He has served as a State representative, agriculture commissioner, Lieutenant Governor, and of course Governor of  During his time as Governor, Rick Perry showed that economic growth and environmental stewardship cannot only survive and coexist, but that they can really thrive. Over the course of 14 years, Texas added 2.2 million jobs, saw its population grow by more than 6 million people, and at the same time he had this robust growth within his State's population, the State reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent, reduced its sulfur dioxide emissions by 56 percent, and reduced its nitrous oxide emissions by 66 percent. So in most States where you have a considerable plus-up in your population and a growing economy, you also see growing levels of impact, growing levels of emission. However Governor Perry dealt with this head-on, and we saw the results over the course of 14 years in the State of  He led an effort to decommission older and dirtier power plants. He prioritized the development of emerging and innovative technologies, including carbon sequestration and capture. As a result of his leadership in the State of Texas, that State now leads our Nation in producing more wind energy than all but five other countries.[[Page S1550]]  Coming from the State of Alaska, as the Presiding Officer and I do, we recognize that we are labeled as an oil Well, Texas certainly has been labeled as an oil-producing Yet under Governor Perry's leadership, we have seen Texas lead the Nation in producing more wind energy than all but five other countries. For those who may come to the floor and suggest that, somehow or another, Governor Perry is anti-environment or bring up the issue of climate change and suggest that he does not support care for our environment, that is simply not the case, and clearly in his case, actions speak louder than words.  As Texas's longest serving Governor, Rick Perry guided a large, diverse and very complex State government to economic success. Again, when we are talking about States, Alaska is always out there bragging about our size, but if Texas were its own country, it would be the 12th largest economy in the world. So it is one thing to talk about size just by way of geography, but I think it is important--when we are talking about economic contribution, the size of Texas as the 12th largest economy in the world is pretty significant.  What happened in the State of Texas? Not only did the people of Texas give their endorsement to Governor Perry to ask him to serve again as Governor, they gave him their endorsement for his work by reelecting him to office not once but twice--14 years. Governor Perry is a principled leader, and that will serve him well as he takes the helm at the Department of  DOE has a very important mission, ranging from the maintenance of our nuclear weapons stockpile to the research and development of new energy technologies. At the same time it is also a department, a bureaucracy, something that I think we recognize. It is large. It is cumbersome, with tens of thousands of employees and contractors. I think the example Governor Perry showed as the State leader of Texas is an example that will do well at the Department of Energy--capable of really setting a good direction for the  It has been suggested that he is not one of them in the sense that he is not an award-winning scientist, but, as I mentioned at his hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, you do not necessarily need to have a scientist to lead other scientists; you need to have somebody who is a good, strong, competent, capable manager. That is what Governor Perry has demonstrated, and that is what the Department of Energy needs. He will hold his employees and contractors accountable. We know he will be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars.  I think he will work to continue to break down the research silos that have frustrated the Department and work to find ways where there can be greater collaboration, greater working together.  I am also confident that he will pursue policies that will ultimately provide us with more energy, more stable sources of energy for us where--unfortunately, we have great sources of energy, but it is high cost. We need to be working with the Department of We need collaboration there to do what we can to reduce the cost of energy, as well as reduce the amount of energy we consume. By supporting basic research, encouraging scientific exploration, and fostering innovation, the Department will increase access to energy, make it more affordable, and continue to improve its environmental performance.  We have 17 National We are very proud of them. These National Labs are at the heart of those efforts. I have had good conversations with Governor He reaffirmed in our committee hearing that he clearly recognizes and values the work done by the men and women at our National  One area, which we do not cover within our Committee on Energy and Natural Resources but which is a big part of DOE's mission, is the maintenance and the protection of America's nuclear weapons. Governor Perry recognizes the importance of that mission, and he is committed to working with experts at the NNSA to maintain a proper stockpile stewardship program.  I believe Governor Perry will also put his management experience to work on a challenge that has really vexed the Department and affected States for a long period of time. He recognizes that we must clean up the legacy wastes that have been left behind by our nuclear weapons programs, particularly at the largest of these sites in Washington My hope is that, through his leadership, the Office of Environmental Management can finally move off of GAO's high-risk list. I know these conversations have been had with many members on the committee. It has been pressed as a priority. But, again, ensuring that we deal with these legacy waste sites has to be a priority.  I will reiterate that my hope is that Governor Perry will help address the crisis of rural energy prices in Alaska, as well as in other parts of the country where unfortunately we face high energy costs.  The Department must do a better job of partnering with institutions. In our State of Alaska, we have the opportunity to work with DOE collaboratively. We have been the incubators of good ideas, whether it is in energy microgrids or in some of the other pioneering way, we have done it because of necessity. We have no other options. We look to our institutions to find these good ideas, build on them, and work to bring down the costs and transition our many remote communities that are still relying on diesel power. Far too many of our communities are still dependent on diesel and that is just not right.  So working with Alaska--allow us to be that proving ground for the Department of Allow us to be that place where we can first deploy some of these new ideas, these innovative ideas, these projects to help lower the costs and really make a difference in people's lives.  Again, I am proud to be here to support Governor Perry's nomination. I believe he has the management experience we need in the Department of Energy right now to help pursue scientific discovery and to promote innovation, to maintain and safeguard our nuclear weapons stockpile, to make progress on the cleanup of legacy waste, and to partner with States like Alaska that suffer from high energy costs.  I think we recognize that he has his work cut out for him, but we are counting on him to fulfill those responsibilities and to keep the Department of Energy as one that we look to for true leadership not only here in the United States but around the world.  Governor Rick Perry has a strong record of results based on his public service in the State of He is a proven leader, and I am confident he will do a good job for us leading the Department of Energy in this new administration. I will be supporting his nomination, and I certainly urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

3195,topic-id,774,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Washington State, who has made a really important case. I want to be here today to add my opinion, as well, because over the past 2 months we have heard a lot about President Trump's plan to drain the swamp, which is to reject special interests and the corporate elite and, instead, fight for workers across our country.  There are a whole lot of claims, a whole lot of promises--all great. Fighting for workers is what this Congress should be doing, but the President's actions speak a lot louder than his words. I find it telling that we are here again debating yet another Cabinet nominee sent over from the White House--this time Rick Perry--whose interests have been more closely aligned with those of Big Oil and corporations rather than advancing our country's energy challenges or fighting for the working families we represent.  So let me be clear. If confirmed to head up the Department of Energy, Governor Perry would join the ranks of other unqualified candidates chosen by this President to lead critically important agencies with very specific and complex functions. It is a big job. I believe that getting the top spot at the Department of Energy--or anywhere else in the President's Cabinet--should not simply be a prize for demonstrating loyalty during an election.  Getting the job should be borne of a solid understanding of the agency, a respect for the tens of thousands of workers they would lead, and, most importantly, a commitment to putting families across the country first. So as a voice from my home State of Washington, where DOE's presence is extremely important, I will vote no on Governor Perry's nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Washington State is home to the Hanford nuclear reservation near the Tri-Nearly 75 years ago, this region underwent a dramatic transformation, practically overnight and under top-secret conditions, to help the United States win World War II and later the Cold  Families and workers in this region of our State sacrificed immensely for the good of our country and the safety of our world. To this day, there is a massive environmental impact in the Tri-Cities created by decades of nuclear weapons production. Now this cleanup effort is vital, not only to the health and safety of families and workers and the economy in Central Washington but also for communities along the Colombia  As I have told anyone elected as President, whether Democrat or Republican, it is the Federal Government's moral and legal obligation and responsibility to clean up I know that is not an easy feat, but it is essential. It requires a very deep understanding of a very large and complex cleanup project and a great deal of respect for the workers who show up each day to make progress on this massive project. I remain deeply concerned that Governor Perry and this administration fail to grasp what is at stake.  I am also concerned that they don't get the importance of another national asset not far from Hanford, the Pacific Northwest National For more than 50 years, the men and women at PNNL have been on the forefront of scientific discovery. It was originally created to support research and development at Hanford, but PNNL has become DOE's premiere chemistry, environmental sciences, and data analytics national lab, tackling some of our Nation's most complex and urgent challenges.  PNNL is a leader in atmospheric research, nuclear detection and nonproliferation, and the Nation's electric grid. Its researchers have taken on everything from high-performance computing to advanced biofuels to analyzing lunar samples from These are critically important functions that advance our  I have worked hard with the entire Washington State congressional delegation, not to mention a whole host of leaders at the local and State level, to support this vital research and development hub and its incredible workforce. Just like the workers at Hanford, they also deserve leaders in this administration who respect and value their work. So, if President Trump were truly looking out for workers across our country, he would take this nomination to the Energy Department very seriously.  I understand Governor Perry gave his word during his confirmation hearing that he would work with us and even come to Washington State to visit Hanford and If he is confirmed by the Senate, you can bet I will hold him to that because one I thing I have learned in the short 40-plus days of this administration is that we do get a lot of words.

3261,topic-id,529,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.42, a measure disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor regarding drug testing unemployment compensation applicants. This legislation would overturn a Department of Labor regulation which, as directed by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, defines the occupations in which States may require unemployed workers to take drug tests as a condition of collecting earned unemployment benefits. Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, which protects us against searches without reasonable cause, the regulation limits drug testing to occupations where drug testing is required, like pipeline safety, some transportation operators, and jobs that require carrying a gun.  Many communities are facing a rising rate of drug use, including my hometown of Congress could and should do more to help people struggling with addiction, but the legislation that we are debating today has nothing to do with fighting drug abuse. It is about allowing States to put one more time-consuming, humiliating obstacle in the way of Americans who work hard and were laid off from their jobs and need unemployment insurance to pay the bills while they look for new jobs. As a reminder, in the aftermath of the recession, the unemployment rate in America went to 10 percent.  There is no evidence that unemployed workers have higher rates of drug abuse than the general population. In fact, logic suggests that rates of serious drug abuse are lower. To be eligible to collect unemployment, a worker must have substantial, recent work experience. He or she must not have been fired for cause. And workers can only collect unemployment insurance if they demonstrate they are actively searching for work.  Instead, it appears that some States may be trying to limit the number of workers who collect unemployment insurance when they are laid off as a way to reduce pressure on underfunded unemployment trust funds. More than half of the State unemployment trust funds are still insolvent, years after the Great  Dozens of States have changed their eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits, imposed administrative hurdles to filing for unemployment, or cut the number of weeks benefits can be received while individuals search for a job. Partly because of those changes, only about one in four unemployed workers in the United States receive unemployment benefits, even though the vast majority of them worked for employers who paid unemployment payroll taxes on their wages. That is the lowest level of benefit receipt among laid-off workers since the Federal-State unemployment insurance program began.  Instead, we should be here crafting bipartisan policies to strengthen unemployment insurance protections to help workers who genuinely want to work to pay their bills while they are looking for new jobs. I remind our colleagues to look at the worker participation rate, not encouraging States to create more obstacles.  I hope that both sides of the aisle will vote ``no'' on this resolution.

In 2012, 7-year-old Jamal Stevens was in his bed when a tornado tore through the house, tossing him onto the embankment along Interstate 485, hundreds of feet from his room.  The warning from the National Weather Service came 10 minutes later,[[Page H2666]]after the tornado had already touched down. This is because my hometown of Charlotte relies on radar nearly 100 miles away, meaning that the National Weather Service is using weak or inaccurate readings when issuing crucial safety warnings for  In 2013, the current system provided a tornado warning, but for citizens in an entirely wrong neighborhood. More recently, a tornado in December of 2015 struck neighboring Union County with no warning from the National Weather  Fortunately, our region has not suffered any fatalities due to the inadequate coverage, but we shouldn't wait for tragedy to act.  The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act requires the Commerce Department to identify weak coverage areas and identify solutions to the problem by improving existing government radars or incorporating non-Federal radars into the National Weather Service's operations.  Americans across the country rely on the National Weather Service to detect and provide warning for severe weather such as thunderstorms and tornadoes. But Charlotte is currently the largest metropolitan area without an adequate radar coverage. Addressing this shortcoming is an important step for public safety.  With that in mind, I do urge my colleagues to support H.353. I thank the chairman so much for his support on this critical legislation.

3199,topic-id,1006,"Madam President, I am strongly opposed to the nomination of Rick Perry to be the Secretary of  While Governor Perry has a long record of public service, he is the wrong choice to lead the Department of He does not possess the technical expertise or necessary qualifications. Moreover, his past statements calling for the elimination of the Department and questioning the science behind climate change, coupled with his reported lack a understanding about the scope of the Department's responsibilities, call into question his ability to lead an agency that is so critical to our national and economic security.  What Governor Perry learned during this confirmation process is that the Secretary of Energy not only oversees our country's energy initiatives and strategies, but is also the steward of our nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. The National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, a part of the Department of Energy, ensures the safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear weapons. The NNSA brings together exceptionally dedicated men and women from our Armed Forces to work alongside some of our best scientists and engineers to provide expert advice in nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism. The Secretary of Energy must understand their work and advise the President on our nuclear arsenal capabilities and national security issues. Governor Perry has no experience in these areas and is not qualified to lead the agency tasked with maintaining our nuclear deterrent.  The Department of Energy also protects our Nation's security by strengthening the electrical grid's resilience in the face of natural disaster and cyber attacks. Its Office of Electricity works with other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and utilities to protect the electrical grid; yet the Trump administration has reportedly proposed eliminating this office, something which Governor Perry has not sought to dispel.  The Department of Energy leads the country and the world in renewable energy generation and energy efficiency. For my home State of Rhode Island, renewable energy from the wind, sun, and ocean is not just a path to local energy production, but also a source of well-paying jobs ranging from steelworkers to scientists. Last year, Rhode Island became the first State to build an offshore wind farm, off the coast of Block Island, proving that offshore wind can be a viable renewable energy source for the United  This technological feat could not have been accomplished without the science, engineering, and policy research supported by the Office of Renewable Energy and Energy This office drives the research in wind, solar, geothermal, and ocean energy that has made affordable renewable energy a reality. However, Governor Perry, in his written responses, refused to comment on reports that the administration would cut funding, or even worse, eliminate this vital department. Failure to invest in this department and its research risks our future as an energy-producing nation.  We need a Secretary of Energy who also can effectively manage the Office of Science and the National Laboratories, programs that have made the United States a global leader in scientific advancement since the Manhattan project. The National Laboratory system hosts equipment far beyond the capabilities of most universities or companies--such as massive particle accelerators, powerful supercomputers, and high-temperature laser ignition facilities--that are vital to expanding our knowledge base and technological advancement.  The future of many of these energy science programs in the new administration is of great concern to the scientific community. The same budget recommendations that would eliminate the Office of Electricity also showed plans to cut supercomputing research, even as China is making large investments to become the world leader in this area. Advanced computing is vital to national defense and economic competitiveness. Shortsighted budget cuts here, or in any of our basic research programs, threaten our Nation's future security and prosperity. Governor Perry has not pledged to protect or prioritize anfof these programs.  The Department of Energy's leadership in atmospheric science and climate change is also threatened. The Trump administration has gone beyond merely ignoring the threat of climate change; it has proposed cutting off funding to the critical programs that monitor our planet. It has also cast doubt that climate data will be accessible and available to the public and other researchers. We have already seen an unprecedented attempt by the Trump transition team to collect the names of scientists who study the consequences of carbon dioxide emissions. It appears that, for the first time in[[Page S1559]]the history of the agency, its scientists are worried that honestly reporting their findings may be a career-ending decision.  This is an alarming assault on the integrity of American science. The Secretary of Energy must be someone who understands science and will protect the government scientists who work in the national interest. The Secretary must understand and be able to present to the President the overwhelming scientific consensus that the climate is changing and that human activities are responsible. All Governor Perry committed to do in this and other areas is to learn more about the science.  This is not sufficient.  We have been fortunate that recent occupants of this post were not learning basic science on the job. Both Presidents Bush and Obama filled this post with experts possessing a deep understanding of science and technological issues. President Bush appointed Samuel Bodman, who served as a member of MIT's faculty before moving into business and government. President Obama appointed a Nobel prize winner in physics, Steven Chu, and a MIT physicist, Ernest The result is that, for the past 12 years, the Department of Energy has been well equipped to respond to challenges in national security, energy, and science.  We need a Secretary of Energy who can build on that legacy. We need a Secretary of Energy who has the technical expertise to oversee our Nation's nuclear stockpile, the integrity to protect basic science from political attacks, and the willingness to fight for a secure grid and renewable energy technology. I am not convinced that Governor Perry has those qualifications.  For these reasons, I cannot support his nomination. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.

3225,topic-id,956,"Mr.President, along with Senator Collins, I am introducing legislation that would eliminate the sunset date for U.Interagency Council on Homelessness--the Council--so that this independent agency can build upon its success in helping to prevent and end homelessness nationally.  The Council was established under the Reagan administration as part of the landmark McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. Since that time, it has worked across the Federal Government and private sector to coordinate homeless assistance nationally. In 2009, the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing, or HEARTH Act, which I authored and introduced along with Senator Collins and others, expanded the Council's role to work with public, nonprofit, and private stakeholders to develop a national strategic plan to end homelessness. On June 22, 2010, the Council unveiled this plan, called Opening Doors, which has guided its work to develop and expand on effective strategies across the country to prevent and end homelessness.  Since Opening Doors was unveiled, the U.Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, reports that overall homelessness has decreased by 14 percent, chronic homelessness by 27 percent, and family homelessness by 23 percent. In addition, we have seen veterans' homelessness drop by 47 percent. This progress is not only a result of the more than $500 million Federal investment in housing and supportive services through programs like HUD-VASH but is also because of the direction the Council provides to the Departments of Veterans Affairs and HUD, as well as public housing agencies administering assistance at the local level. Specifically, the Council helped various partners align their resources, efforts, goals, and measures of success for serving homeless veterans. Under this approach, the Commonwealth of Virginia, Connecticut, Delaware, the city of New Orleans, and DeKalb County in Georgia, to name a few, have all declared an end to veterans' homelessness.  Yet more work remains. And here, too, the Council is an important part of developing solutions. For instance, nearly 36,000 unaccompanied youth under the age of 25 experienced homelessness in 2016. While some communities have started to develop responses to youth homelessness, it is a complex problem that requires a tailored approach taking into account the local variables of foster care, primary to postsecondary education, housing, and healthcare systems. Finding new ways to deliver and fund assistance to this diverse population is essential, and that is why Senator Collins and I held a hearing in our subcommittee on this matter and worked together to include over $40 million in targeted resources to address youth homelessness in both the fiscal year 2016 and 2017 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, THUD, appropriations bills. As part of this new funding, the Council will be executing a broader collaborative effort with foster care networks, the juvenile justice community, and education partners to create and find[[Page S2050]]success in coordinated, cost-effective solutions that meet community needs. The Council's expertise in implementing complex Federal programs at the local level will continue to be critical to the success of this initiative.  For all of this good work the Council has done and continues to do, it is vital that we keep its doors open. The Council, as the only agency at the federal level charged specifically with addressing homelessness, has helped communities not only reduce homelessness, but it has also helped to save money. We know that people experiencing homelessness are more likely to access expensive health care services and spend more time in incarceration--which are extremely costly to taxpayers, states, and local governments. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, ``Based on 22 different studies from across the country, providing permanent supportive housing to chronically homeless people creates net savings of $4,800 per person per year, through reduced spending on jails, hospitals, shelters, and other emergency services.''  The Council has helped to build upon these estimated savings by identifying and tailoring cost-effective solutions that reduce the level of health care services, as well as recidivism, for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. In fiscal year 2016 alone, the Council's modest $3.5 million budget catalyzed more than $5 billion in combined Federal resources that aim to address homelessness. It develops national strategies that inform the work and improve the cost-effectiveness of programs administered by 19 Federal agencies, and as a result, communities and Sates are able to leverage housing, health, education, and labor funding more strategically and effectively.  In our current budgetary environment we need a wise and creative arm to help our communities identify and maximize resources and opportunities where possible, to ensure we are actually addressing homelessness, and not contributing to it. The Council is proof that the government can work and save money in the process, and our bipartisan legislation ensures that the Council's doors remain open until there truly is an end to homelessness nationwide.  I thank the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, HousingWorksRI, the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, A Way Home America, Community Solutions, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, Funders Together to End Homelessness, the True Colors Fund, the National Housing Trust, the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, LISC, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, National Network for Youth, LeadingAge, Heartland Alliance, National Housing Conference, the National AIDS Housing Coalition, Covenant House International, the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, the Forum for Youth Investment, the Housing Assistance Council, Volunteers of America, the Coalition on Human Needs, the Corporation for Supportive Housing, the Technical Assistance Collaborative, and the National Coalition for the Homeless for their support.

3114,topic-id,212,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.437. Whether the result of a naturally occurring outbreak, like Zika or Ebola, or an intentional release of bio-pathogens, like anthrax attacks that shook Washington immediately after 9/11, we must ensure that our public health and medical response communities are prepared to respond to events that may stretch their capabilities.  In recent years, the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program has been eliminated, and grants supported by the Department of Health and Human Services, such as the Hospital Preparedness Program, have been cut. As a result, many jurisdictions have been forced to make tough choices and, in many cases, divert other limited funding to support medical preparedness.  Under current law, the Urban Area Security Initiative and the State Homeland Security Grant Program funding can be used to bolster medical preparedness capabilities, but the ability to use funds for that purpose is contingent on the grant guidance issued[[Page H798]]every year. H.437 would make enhancing medical preparedness and medical surge capacity and capabilities eligible uses of Homeland Security Grant funds under the law.  This measure passed in the House last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to again support this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

3323,topic-id,1645,"I thank Chairman Grassley for that question and the invitation to join him in the colloquy. As two of the only non-attorneys on the Judiciary Committee, it is important that we, on behalf of the majority of Americans, who are non-lawyers, do reclaim the separation of powers as a basic American inheritance. So I thank the Senator for the chance to discuss it here today.  Starting the morning after President Trump's victory last November, there has actually been something of a renaissance of separation of powers talk among many folks around this body, and that is a good thing. After 8 years of legislative atrophy, many on the other side of the aisle are now remembering the old ``Schoolhouse Rock'' distinction among the three separate and coequal branches, and this is good news for Americans' civic health.  If Democrats are serious--frankly, if all of us are serious, for we in this body have taken an oath not to a political party but to a constitutional structure of limits where power is intentionally separated and divided because our forefathers and foremothers were skeptical of the consolidation of power--if we take this seriously and we would like to reclaim some of the Congress's responsibility and ability and authority to check and balance the other two branches, the debate around Judge Gorsuch's nomination and the hearings we will have beginning in the chairman's committee next month are a great place to start. So I wish to offer a little bit of what I think is an important historical backdrop for this debate.  Any discussion of the separation of powers must be rooted in a solid understanding of what we mean and what the Founders meant by the phrase ``the consent of the governed.'' Historically speaking, this is still a bold idea which must be constantly defined, reclaimed, renewed, and passed on to the next generation, for over the course of human history, we can put every form of government into one of two categories: You are ruled either by people you didn't choose or by people you did choose.  One of these groups has taken many forms through the centuries--Kings, elites, political parties, and technocrats. Indeed, most governments throughout human history fit this mold, where the people were ruled by a form of government that they had no say in and that they didn't choose. But there is another group, and these are people who rule themselves through the leaders they have chosen and continually get to choose. When the leaders fail to serve the will of the people, those leaders can be removed. This describes our form of government and its historical anomaly. We should recognize that, and our kids should understand what a special blessing it is to live under this form of government.  The point is elegantly simple: Either people are ruled, or the people are ultimately and fundamentally the rulers. Why does this matter? This isn't a question to take flippantly but, rather, each generation of Americans should reexamine and reclaim and reteach it. So why is it so important that ``the people'' are actually the rulers in their government? It comes down to a profound truth about human dignity. Human beings cannot thrive when they are stripped of basic liberties. Human flourishing requires the freedom to make basic choices about how you will live your life in community: Who are your friends? Whom will you marry? Where will you work? What do you believe? Whom do you worship? How do you worship? These are the things the Founders meant when they said that we are all born with the right to life, to liberty, and to the pursuit of happiness.  Notice that the Founders were not referring to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as a bunch of vague platitudes or as aspirational pleasantries for a bumper sticker; they were talking about rights. These are not given to us by any other man or woman. They are rights we have from God via nature, and so they can't be taken away from us by some other mere man or woman.  Here is what is great about this idea: We are all born equals in the eyes of God and history, and we have certain rights. As a group of equals, it requires people to get permission to serve for a time--for a limited time--as our rulers. This equality is what the Founders called the self-evident truth--something so obvious that it didn't need to be proven; a truth so true that denying it would be denying something essential and true about human nature itself. Once we understand this, our expectations of our government begin to change. We expect responsiveness and transparency. We expect equality before the law.  Government's primary purpose is not to solve every human problem, like a King or some all-powerful technocrat; rather, the government's job is to provide a framework for ordered liberty so that we can live our lives in our communities, in our families, in our businesses, and in our places of worship. Government's job is to secure the rights of a free and sovereign people.  But what does this have to do with Judge Gorsuch? What does this have to do with the confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court next week? What does this have to do with separation of powers?  As Americans, we secure our rights by separating the functions of government into what our Founders called the three different departments: There is a Congress to write the laws, and this is article I of the Constitution; there is a President--or Presiding Officer, as he was first called--to execute the laws; and there is a court to decide the controversies under the law. This system of checks and balances keeps too much power from falling into any one set of hands, and it keeps the American people in charge.  We sometimes talk euphemistically about judicial activism, and that is a big problem, but we don't attack it enough. A judge who takes it as his or her job to do anything other than settle cases is not just being an activist, they are becoming an untouchable, unfireable ruler. They are becoming a lawmaker who is not accountable to the people because our judges have lifetime tenure. A judge who uses his or her position to write the law fundamentally undermines the foundation of government, which is that the will of the people should rule.  That is why I am so strongly supporting Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Justice on the U.Supreme He fully understands the place in the government and his place in the government as a servant of the people, not as some unchosen ruler with lifetime tenure.  When you listen to Judge Gorsuch, when you read his speeches, when you read his opinions, it is clear that he is not interested in making laws. He knows that is not his calling. He is interested in interpreting law. He is interested in upholding and defending the He is not interested, when he has his robe on, in specific policy outcomes; he is interested in justice. He is not interested in the laws that he as a private citizen might want; he is focused on the laws that are actually written in the books. He is a judge's judge, and that is exactly what the Constitution calls for.  In closing, I wish to read three quotes from Judge Gorsuch into the Record to demonstrate how he conceives of his job. Again, this is Judge Gorsuch paying tribute to Justice Scalia:       Tonight I want to . . . suggest that perhaps the great      project of Justice Scalia's career was to remind us of the      differences between judges and legislators. To remind us that      legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and to      claims about social utility to reshape the law as they think      it should be in the future. But that judges should do none of      these things in a democratic society. That judges should      strive (if humanly and so imperfectly) to apply the law as it      is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to the text,      structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at      the time of the events in question would have understood the      law to be--not to decide cases based on [a judge's] own moral      convictions or the policy consequences they believe might      serve society best.  Again, he is saying a judge is not a superlegislator. If a judge wants to be a legislator, that is a completely fine thing to do. Take off your robe, resign your position, and run for office so the[[Page S1789]]people can decide whether to hire you or fire you. But a judge who has lifetime tenure doesn't get to make their policy preferences the will of the people somehow.  The second quote:       When the political branches disagree with a judicial      interpretation of existing law, the Constitution prescribes      the appropriate remedial process. It's called legislation.      Admittedly, the legislative process can be an arduous one.      But that's no bug in the constitutional design: It is the      very point of the design.  Third and finally:       To the founders, the legislative and judicial powers were      distinct by nature and their separation was among the most      important liberty-protecting devices of the constitutional      design, an independent right of the people essential to the      preservation of all other rights later enumerated in the      Constitution and its amendments.

3328,topic-id,1270,"Mr.President, what should we call it? What do we call this new bill the Republicans are rushing[[Page S1793]]through to take away healthcare from millions of Americans? Is it TrumpCare? Is it RyanCare?  It is important to remember that both Paul Ryan and President Trump are branding experts. The President put his name on a line of steaks. He put his name on a magazine, on hotels. Then, here is the Speaker of the House, who has worked pretty hard to be thought of, at least in this town, as a policy wonk and serious thinker, who has branded everything he has worked on from the Ryan budget to ``A Better Way.'' Yet neither leader of the Republican Party wants to own this thing. That is because TrumpCare is one of the worst pieces of legislation I have ever seen.  The process has been a total mess, and this is despite the fact that the Republicans had 7 years to work on a plan. At first, they were thinking about doing this without getting a score from the Congressional Budget Office, the Then they realized that even their own Members--even their loyal soldiers--did not want to vote on something without knowing how much it would cost or how many people would lose healthcare.  Now they are saying the score either does not matter or it is wrong except for the areas in which they like the score. They spent the last 48 hours trashing the CBO, when there is plenty of evidence that for the last 8 years, they referred to the CBO as an expert source when it fit their needs.  Look, the legislative process requires hearings, expert testimony, and that is not a mere formality. That is how you get a decent product. For all of the complaints about the way the ACA was passed, they did have hearings; they had discussions. It took over a year. President Obama, himself, even went to the Republican retreat and personally engaged in policy.  Moving this fast without having hearings is the kind of thing you do when naming a post office or doing some other noncontroversial measure, or it is the kind of thing you do for something that you don't want people to look at very closely because, with every moment that passes, this coalition frays, if it ever existed in the first place.  Now you have criticism from literally the left, right, and center. That is, in part, because no one saw this coming. No one expected a bill that would look like this because during the campaign this administration promised not to cut It promised that everyone--every single American--would have health insurance, but here we are. If TrumpCare becomes law, 14 million people will lose their healthcare next year. Let me repeat that. In just 1 year, 14 million Americans will no longer have the health insurance they were promised.  I want to talk about what that means, what will it mean if people no longer have healthcare.  This week, the Washington Post featured the stories of people in a single county whose lives have changed for the better because of In McDowell County, WV, Medicaid has helped thousands of people get access to physical therapy and immunizations. It has allowed them to see counselors for mental health problems and opioid addiction. It has helped them to afford the medication they need instead of relying on free samples from clinics.  These services do not just benefit the individuals, they benefit the whole community by making sure people are healthy enough so they can work and contribute to the economy. They allow us to save money by focusing on prevention instead of treatment. This is what is at stake. These are the services that will go away because TrumpCare is going to cut Medicaid by $880 billion.  Here is another thing. TrumpCare is also going to impose an age tax that will allow insurance companies to charge older people more money for health insurance--a lot more. I want to be clear. We are not just talking about senior citizens here, we are talking about people who are pre-Medicare; in other words, anyone under the age of 65 but not exactly young. For example, a 64-year-old will be charged up to five times the amount a 21-year-old will be charged. Starting at age 25, the older you get, the more money you will get charged. That is why AARP has come out against this bill, because every year you get older they will charge you more. This is an age tax. This is a penalty for getting older.  There is an important point to be made about process, and that is this: This is actually not a healthcare bill. That is not a political statement. That is not a rhetorical flourish. Here is what is going on. If this were a healthcare bill, it would be new legislation. In order to pass legislation, under the rules of the U.Senate, which were agreed upon by both parties over many years, you need 60 votes. The reason we are working this through reconciliation is, they have nowhere near 60 votes.  So what can you do within the reconciliation process? They are basically stuck with dealing with taxes and subsidies because they only require 51 votes. That is all they can do. This is a tax vehicle.  Then, the question becomes, Who is getting money, and who is getting charged more money? On that count, this tax bill is one of the biggest wealth transfers in American history. It is a transfer from working-class Americans to rich That is what this bill does. It takes money from the people who need help the most and gives it to the very wealthy.  Here we are in 2017, just a few months out from an election in which income inequality was one of the driving issues on both sides of the aisle. What the Republicans in the House seem to take from that experience is that their mandate is to go in and reduce taxes for insurance executives who make more than $500,000 a year and for the investor class in order to cut Medicaid by $880 billion. It is like they were asleep all of last year or maybe they were never very serious about income inequality. We do not need another election to know this is not what the American people expect from the They expect bipartisan compromise. They expect results that will make their healthcare better.  My own view is, we can work together on healthcare, but it requires three things: first, good faith; second, bipartisanship; third, legislative hearings. Frankly, we have seen none of these things because the process has been a mess. We need to have a conversation in the light of day and let the American people weigh in. What is the rush?  There is no doubt there is plenty of room for improvement in the existing healthcare law, but TrumpCare makes it much worse. It will cause chaos in the American economy and in 24 million Americans' lives. That is a threat to the progress we have made over the last 7 years. It is a threat to one-sixth of the American economy. Most of all, it is a threat to at least 24 million Americans who stand to lose their healthcare.  These threats are the reasons the Senate needs to come together and say: Slow down. Let's work together. Let's work on forming a bipartisan foundation. Let's have hearings. Most importantly, let's not impose this catastrophe in a hurry on the American people.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-14-pt1-PgS1784-3.txt,2173,COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT,2017.0,14.0,February

As I have mentioned here on the floor several times, we Democrats want the process to be as fair and transparent as possible, abiding by all the ethics requirements demanded of nominees in the past. Yet the HELP Committee today will hold a hearing on Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, who is worth $5 billion and owns an investment company with untold financial entanglements, despite the fact that she doesn't have a signed ethics agreement in place. When somebody has such wealth and such complicated holdings, we have always made them sign an ethics agreement that says ``Here is how I am going to divest so there is no conflict of interest,'' so it is clear that the nominee is doing things for their country, not for their financial holdings. We don't have it, and we are rushing ahead with hearings in the HELP My dear friend whom I have so much respect for, the chair, the Senator from Tennessee, is just rushing forward, rushing forward. That is not a good way to start. It is not a good way for my Republican colleagues or the President-elect to start.[[Page S325]]  Then we have Wilbur He is the nominee for He is a billionaire. We have a Cabinet loaded with billionaires, despite how President-Elect Trump campaigned. Mr.Wilbur Ross is a billionaire with vast and complicated holdings. He just delivered his paperwork yesterday. His hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. The paperwork is very complicated. When you have $1 billion, it is not just in U.treasuries. But they are rushing forward. The committee needs some time to review those documents before a hearing. I am hopeful we can move it back.  Then there is the fact that tomorrow there are four hearings. We have asked the majority to space out the hearing schedule so that Members who sit on multiple committees can have time to prepare and attend all the hearings. That is going to be very difficult for many Members tomorrow.  We have tried to cooperate with my friend, the majority leader. These are not good signs. They don't bode well.  You can see why the President-elect and Republicans are trying to rush these nominees through. The President-elect promised to change the way America operates, to oppose elites and the rigged system, to clean the swamp, and to pay attention to working families. But now he is rigging the Cabinet with billionaires and bankers. It is exactly the opposite of what the President-elect campaigned on, so they are trying to get it done as quickly as possible--the less scrutiny, the better. They don't want these people exposed for who they are and what they represent. Oh, no, that is not fair to the American people. They deserve the chance to get a good look at these nominees.

3220,topic-id,515,"Mr.President,today we celebrate one of our democracy's core attributes: the peaceful transfer of power. It is remarkable. I am always amazedhow voters, on a cold November evening in my State, come home from work--they would like to serve dinner to their kids or sit intheir favorite chair and watch their favorite TV show, but in quiet dignity, they wait in line and wait their turn to cast theirvote. Then everyone awaits the decision. And the next morning, we all abide by it. It is an amazing thing about this democracy.There are no riots and tanks in the streets. It is a great thing. And although I regret the outcome of the electionobviously--deeply--I still am awed by how the wellspring of democracy continues to work for 225 years after the Founders puttogether the remarkable document, the  Now it falls to us--Senators from both parties--to promote and defendthese principles, as we must every day: the rule of law, equal protection for all Americans under it, and freedom of speech,press, and religion. We must also endeavor to expand opportunity and increase prosperity while broadening the circle ofAmericans who share in it. The peaceful transfer of power occurred, and our work starts now.  President Trump said in hisinaugural address this afternoon:       For too long, a small group in our Nation's capital has      reapedthe rewards of government while the people have borne      the cost. Washington flourished--but the people did not share      its wealth.  He promised to combat that trend, but in one of his first acts as President, President Trump made it harder forAmericans to afford a mortgage. For working-class Americans, struggling Americans, now it is harder for them[[Page S349]]to get amortgage. What did he do? He reversed a recent decision by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to reduce annualinsurance premiums that many borrowers pay, saving new homeowners an average of $500 per year. What a terrible thing to do tohomeowners. President Trump, with a flick of the pen, ended that new policy, making it harder for Americans of modest means toobtain their piece of the rock, the American dream: their own home. It took only an hour after his positive words on theinaugural platform for his words to ring hollow. And actions speak louder than words. One hour after talking about helpingworking people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people, he signs a regulation that makes it more expensive for newhomeowners to buy mortgages--1 hour later.  I ask the American people--because we Democrats are going to do this. We are goingto hold the President accountable. Look at what the President said and then an hour later, look at what the President did.Again, actions speak louder than words. The words on that inaugural platform in relation to this new action ring hollow.  Democrats agree with President Trump on this: The working men and women of America do not need more promises, they needpolicies that give them a leg up, help them succeed, help them afford a home, for instance. We urge President Trump to reversethis decision and give new homeowners across America their $500 back.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS348-4.txt,1036,DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO DRUG,2017.0,20.0,March

3290,topic-id,484,"Madam President, since coming to office, the President's National Security Council has experienced more turmoil than any in history at this stage in a The President's first National Security Advisor and head of the NSC, Michael Flynn, was fired after only a month in his position. The Council itself has been reshaped in ways that concern all of us. Permanent postings for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of the National Intelligence Agency have been removed and a permanent seat has been installed for White House Political Adviser Steve  This organization is a disturbing and profound departure from past administrations. On the most sensitive matters of national security, the President should be relying on the informed counsel of members of the intelligence and military communities, not political advisers who made their careers running a White nationalist website.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the President's primary military adviser and, along with that of the Director of National Intelligence, is the only independent, apolitical voice on the President Trump's move to strip them of their seats is baffling and potentially endangers our national security. The President has installed in their stead one of the most strident, ideological voices in his orbit.  On the most sensitive issues of national security, we have to have fact-based decisions. The President has to get the most dispassionate and accurate advice. With all due respect, that is not Mr.Bannon's forte. His installation on the principals list of the NSC moves it further away from what it needs to be and closer toward a shadow council of a dangerously ideological West  The bottom line is, this decision was poorly thought out and ill-conceived. It puts a filter on the information going to the President and will make us less safe. My concerns are shared by Members on both sides of the aisle.

It has special relevance today because we are about to vote on reappointing H.McMaster to lieutenant general, who will be the next head of the General McMaster, by all accounts, will have a grounding presence in the national security apparatus of the White I have met him.

3326,topic-id,1329,"Mr.President, I want to first thank my colleague from Michigan for her outstanding presentation. It was succinct. It was on point. It showed all the problems with I hope we will see a lot more not only of her speaking about this--and I know we will--but those great charts she put together.  I, too, rise this afternoon again on the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care There has been some confusion about what to call it. Speaker Ryan, one of the principal authors of the bill, doesn't want it called President Trump doesn't want it called President Trump slapped his name on buildings, ties, steaks, hotels, and golf clubs, but not on a bill that he says he supports. If it is so good, why doesn't any Republican want to put their name on it? I think the reason is because every single day, as we learn more and more about the bill, more and more Americans are turning against it. Doctors don't like it. Patients don't like it. Hospitals don't like it. Women don't like it. Millennials don't like it. Seniors don't like it. More and more Republicans don't like it. And Democrats are totally united against it.  So I just want to ask one question. TrumpCare has been public for 1 week now. Is there any group left in the country who actually likes it? I am not sure there is. So Republicans have resorted to their usual talking points.  They like to talk about access to healthcare. That is what Price said over and over again. He didn't talk about people getting healthcare, just having access to healthcare.  They say they want universal access to healthcare. Well, every American has universal access to a You can walk into the Lamborghini showroom and say: I would like to purchase one. The proprietor says: Well, that will be a couple hundred thousand dollars. And you can't buy it. Access is not enough. Access is not enough.  Every single American would like a huge mansion worth $10 million. They have access. They can go to a real estate agent and say: Show me a list of $10 million mansions in my community. That is access, but they can't afford it. We know when Price and others talk about access, they are trying to actually verbally trick the American people because people can't afford this healthcare. They will not have the healthcare, but they can inquire about it. That is all access is.  Americans are smarter than that. They know having good health insurance is what leads to affordable healthcare. Access to care will not make us well and will not save our lives if we can't afford it.  So what is the real effect of this TrumpCare bill? Last night the Congressional Budget Office made clear that 24 million fewer Americans will have health insurance if TrumpCare becomes the law of the land. It is one of the biggest broken promises that this President has made, and he has broken a lot of them. In an interview with the Washington Post, here's what the President said: ``We're going to have insurance for everybody.'' President Trump: ``We're going to have insurance for everybody'' that is ``much less expensive and better.''  Well, the CBO report confirms that TrumpCare does not even remotely come close to that pledge. The President was off by only 24 million That is more than the population of my entire  Seniors will also get crushed with higher premiums. Americans of all ages will have to pay more out-of-pocket costs with deductibles and copays. Let me give you one example from the CBO report. A 64-year-old American not eligible for Medicare who makes maybe $26,500 a year would have to pay a premium of $14,600. That is more than half of that senior's entire income. How is that even possible? If there were ever a war on seniors, this bill, TrumpCare, is it.  The CBO report also showed that TrumpCare spends more on tax breaks for the very wealthy and for insurance companies than it does on tax credits to help middle-class Americans afford health insurance. In the final tally, TrumpCare would erase more than $1 trillion from programs that help poor and middle-class families in order to fund an almost $900 billion tax break aimed largely at the wealthy and corporations. That would constitute one of the greatest transfers of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the very rich in the last few decades. As my friend Leader Pelosi said this morning: It is reverse Robin Hood, taking from the poor and giving it to the rich. I would say that this bill, TrumpCare, is reverse Robin Hood on steroids.  Rather than going back to the drawing board to solve these problems, what are our Republican friends doing? Attacking CBO, the messenger. There is just one problem: This messenger they are attacking is their own messenger. Who appointed Hall as the head of CBO? Who was the person most responsible? None other than Secretary Price, now the head of HHS, handpicked him.  Hall has great conservative Republican credentials. Not only was he picked by Tom Price, but he worked at the Mercatus Center, which we all know is funded in good part by the Koch brothers. He is a man chosen by one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, who is now HHS He taught at an institute funded by the Koch brothers, the leading funders of the hard right, and they are attacking him. They don't like his honest answers.  Republicans are attacking the referee because they are losing the game, plain and simple. Everyone from second grade on was taught by their parents not to attack the referee because it is unsportsmanlike. In this case it is a lot worse. It has life and death consequences, unlike a softball game for a second grader.  If we look at the CBO's score, it is hard to call this a healthcare bill. A healthcare bill actually intends to provide insurance to more Americans; this bill results in 24 million fewer Americans with health insurance. A healthcare bill would help people afford health insurance; this bill would likely increase costs on middle-class and working families while making it cheaper for the top 1 percent and much cheaper for the top 0.1 percent. They get the biggest benefit. They get a huge tax break. A healthcare bill would seek to protect older and sicker Americans who need health insurance the most; this bill jacks up the price on older Americans the most. A healthcare bill would make it easier for Americans to shop for health insurance, but the CBO says that under this bill, plans would be harder to compare, ``making shopping for a plan on the basis of price more difficult.'' That is their quote.  By no measure can we call TrumpCare an actual healthcare bill. The only thing this bill makes healthier is bank accounts for the wealthiest People who make above $250,000 would get an average tax break of $200,000. People who make $1 million would get an average tax break of $57,000. That is what this bill is all about.  Our Republican friends have cut taxes on the rich. That is what their tax reform bill will be about. That is what this is all about. At a time when Donald Trump was campaigning to help the middle class, the working people, he gets into office, and boom: The first big, big, big proposal reduces taxes on the wealthiest people. This is not going to play well in Peoria, Brooklyn, or  We Democrats are going to stand strong, stay united, and fight tooth and nail against TrumpCare until our Republican friends drop their repeal efforts for good.

3325,topic-id,1549,"Mr.President, before the distinguished Senator from Maryland leaves the floor, I want to thank him for his powerful advocacy on behalf of his citizens. And I would only say ``amen'' as he was speaking because there is so much at stake for the moms and dads and kids and grandpas and grandmas in Michigan and And that is why we are on the floor speaking out so strongly and fighting so hard to defeat a very bad proposal.  Let me start by indicating that what is being debated right now in the House, the TrumpCare proposal, is not what President Trump promised. It is just not what he promised. He said it would be great. He said that people would get as good healthcare or better healthcare and that it would cost less. We know that is simply not true.  According to a FOX News report on the increase of people who would no longer have healthcare, be able to get medical care, be able to go to a doctor under the new TrumpCare plan, 14 million people would lose their healthcare, be unable to take their children to a doctor, just in the next year, by next year. People will have to go to the emergency room rather than a family doctor. Rather than being able to take care of a cold or something minor for their children, chances are that it would become something very serious before they would be able to be in a position to take them to a doctor or, more likely, an emergency room.  We know that in the next 10 years, we are talking about 24 million Americans--moms, dads, grandpas, grandmas, kids who would no longer be able to see a doctor and no longer have health insurance.  TrumpCare would also cost 7 million people who have an employer right now who is providing them health insurance so that they can get to the doctor and care for their family--7 million people would lose the insurance they have through their employer right now. That is not making things better. There would be 7 million people in that situation.  This is really a triple-whammy for middle-class families across our country and certainly for people in There would be higher costs, less coverage, and more taxes.  I believe we need to join with AARP and our doctors, hospitals, nurses, people who treat cancer, Alzheimer's, breast cancer, juvenile diabetes, and all of the other people who care for and advocate on behalf of loved ones or themselves, people who need to be able to see a doctor and get healthcare coverage. We need to say no to the TrumpCare plan that is being proposed in the  One thing that is really outrageous in this proposal is a senior tax that allows insurance companies to hike up rates on older It is right in the budget report. This is in the budget report we have now received. They are saying that in 2026--in 10 years--a single woman or man 64 years of age making $26,500 a year who currently pays $1,700 for their health insurance would suddenly get a bill for $14,600. So under this plan, that 64-year-old is going to go from $1,700 out-of-pocket to see a doctor to get their treatments, to be able to get the care they need, to $14,600. If you compare that to somebody who is 64 and makes $3.7 million a year, the good news for them is that they are going to get a $200,000 tax cut.  Most people in Michigan work hard every single day, get up and go to work, maybe take a shower after work, maybe take a shower before work, but most of the people I represent don't make $200,000 a year. Yet we are talking about a $200,000 tax cut for multimillionaires, which is in this proposal.  That is why the AARP, a nonpartisan organization representing millions of people across the country, is actively working to defeat this.  We also know that this creates what I call a voucher under Medicaid, meaning that instead of paying for whatever nursing home care is needed--if your mom or dad has Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, or they are simply in a nursing home for a variety of reasons, right now they get whatever care they need. There is not a cap on the amount of care. There is not a limit on the amount of care. Under this proposal, there would be X amount of dollars put aside for your mom or dad or grandpa or grandma, and if the care they needed because of their Alzheimer's disease was more than that, you would pay for it or your elderly parent in some way would have to figure out how to pay for it. This is outrageous.  Medicaid for families and for seniors in nursing homes has been a critical part of making sure people can get the medical care they need. I, frankly, celebrate today the fact that under the Medicaid expansion, under the Affordable Care Act, 97 percent of the children in Michigan can see a doctor. Imagine that. Ninety-seven percent of the children, almost all of our children, can go to a family doctor. Their moms and dads know that they are going to be able to take them to the doctor when they get sick. I don't want to roll that back, but that is what the TrumpCare proposal does.  We also know--because this was reported on FOX News as well--that the new plan would add a 15- to 20-percent premium increase for individuals starting next year--a 15- to 20-percent premium increase for individuals starting next year at the same time as big tax cuts for multimillionaires.  I have to say, as somebody who worked very, very hard on the women's healthcare provisions and authored the maternity care provisions, I find it outrageous that the TrumpCare proposal would mean that maternity care is not covered as part of basic healthcare for women.  Prior to the Affordable Care Act being passed, only 12 percent of the plans in Michigan--12 plans out of 100--offered maternity care. If you tried to buy maternity care as part of the basic coverage, you would have to get a rider. You would have to pay more.  Let's say maybe you gambled. Well, you weren't planning on getting pregnant and you weren't sure what was going to happen, so you didn't pay extra. Then you get pregnant. Guess what. You had a preexisting condition, and you couldn't get insurance. We don't want to go back to the time where being a woman was, in fact, a preexisting condition. And speaking of preexisting conditions, this plan puts them back in the hands of the insurance companies and creates penalties for people.  The truth is, under the Affordable Care Act, we made sure that when you purchase insurance, it is a real plan. It is not a junk plan. You can't get dropped when you get sick. If you have a preexisting condition, they can't block you. If you are a woman, you don't have to pay more. If you have a mental illness rather than a physical illness, you don't have to pay more. If you need cancer treatments, the insurance company can't tell your doctor how many treatments you are going to get or how much they will pay for your treatments. Everybody has benefited from that. Everybody who has insurance in this country has benefited from that.  One of the most important provisions relates to preexisting conditions, and that, in fact, is not continued, as it should be for American families.  Finally, let me just say that while we are talking about people paying more, getting less coverage, middle-class families paying more in taxes, guess what. Wealthy people do not. So if you are a multimillionaire, you are going to get big tax cuts in this provision, and the middle-class family, the working family, is going to pay for it. They are going to pay for it in higher premiums. They are going to pay for it in less healthcare for their family. That is absolutely unacceptable.  In addition to that, there is a tax break for insurance company CEOs so that they can, in fact, get a raise up to $1 million. So in this proposal, very wealthy people--insurance and drug companies' CEOs--are taken care of. Vast amounts of money are put back in their pockets, while money is taken out of yours. Absolutely unacceptable.  That is why we, as Democrats, are fighting so hard to make sure this does not happen, is not passed, and that, in fact, we will work together to strengthen our healthcare system.  We know there are areas where premiums are too high, copays are too high, and we need to work together on a bipartisan basis to fix that. But unraveling our entire system, ripping it apart, creating chaos, more cost, less[[Page S1792]]ability to go to the doctor, and less medical care for people is absolutely unacceptable.  The bottom line is that TrumpCare means more money out of your pocket and less healthcare for you and your family. That is just wrong in the greatest country in the world.

It is beautiful. Flanked by the towering Tongass National Forest, it is a place full of life and spirit, mountains, forests, lots of rain, lots of salmon, and lots of jaw-dropping scenery.  Yet, like most places across our country, it has its challenges, and it has a challenge with homelessness, like many communities in America and Luckily, for all of us, Ketchikan is also home to a very caring community that has set its sights on helping its fellow One of these people is Pastor Evelyn Erbele, our Alaskan of the Week, who has dedicated her life to helping others.  Evelyn is the copastor with her husband Terry of the First United Methodist Church of There is a day shelter in the church's social hall, which provides a hot meal, shower, clean clothes, and a place for the community's homeless to go every day of the week.  Oftentimes when we think of homelessness, we think of people not having a place to sleep, but it is also important to remember that being homeless means having no place to go during the day. First City Homeless Services--Day Shelter gives people a place to go during the day. Pastor Evelyn oversees that day shelter. According to the manager of the shelter, Chris Alvarado, who himself has been homeless, she does so with commitment and with kindness and with compassion.  ``She has a heart of gold and gives 100 percent,'' said one resident of Ketchikan about  Evelyn met her husband Terry in Seward, AK, where she was a nurse in 1976.

She didn't know when she accepted the job at the Methodist Church in Ketchikan as copastor that she would be overseeing the day shelter. At first, according to her, the work was a bit unsettling. ``I never intentionally walked side by side with people who are homeless,'' she said. She continued: ``Initially, I may have been biased. I was using the word `them' when I would describe the people I was working with. One day, the Lord said to me, Evelyn, you are them. You are my child no less or no more than they are.'' She said that after hearing that voice, she realized she wasn't working with ``them'' anymore. ``I was working with men and women who were in a place that I easily could have been.''  In her years working to help the homeless in her community in Ketchikan, she realized that not everybody who is homeless fits neatly into ``one basket.'' There are lots of reasons for homelessness, she said, and the homeless may have many, many faces: men, women, children, families, the old, and the young.

3286,topic-id,1913,"Mr.President, this week is Sunshine Week, a week when we applaud open government and when we celebrate the institutions that hold government accountable. Throughout our Nation's history, one of the most important has been the press, the free press. Donald Trump, as candidate and President, has repeatedly attacked the press. He has called it the ``enemy of the people,'' he has labeled the national media outlets as ``fake news,'' and he has criticized respected reporters who have reported for years.  He has singled out mainstream newspapers like the New York Times, Politico, and the Los Angeles Times, and television outlets like ABC, NBC, CBS, That is how this President operates. He acts like a bully, and not just with the media. He attacks the courts when article III judges disagree with him, and when they find he is breaking the law. He attacks sitting judges for deciding against him, even those appointed by Republican  Without basis, he attacks our intelligence agencies, and he even demeans career public servants who risk their lives to keep our Nation safe. The President's goal is obvious, to undermine the institutions in our country who threaten him, who criticize him. Authoritarians have used this strategy for centuries and continue to do so today in countries where democracy is weak or nonexistent and where autocracy or kleptocracy is strong.  But this is the United We are an example to the world of democratic principles and action. The President's repeated attacks on our democratic institutions need to stop and they need to stop now. A free and robust press is critical for democracy to work, period, end of story. Our Nation's history of a free press dates back to our founding. Free press in the colonial United States developed in reaction to severe restrictions on free speech in  During the latter half of the 17th century, all books and articles were required to be licensed by the government to be published. Then, ``seditious libel''--bringing ``hatred or contempt'' upon the Crown or the Parliament by written word--was a criminal offense. So to speak against the Crown was a criminal offense. Truth was not a defense.  No publication could criticize the Crown or the government, even if it was accurate. The first newspapers in the Colonies operated under licenses from the colonial But by 1721, James Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's older brother, was publishing one of the first colonial independent newspapers, the New England Courant, in  Ben Franklin was his apprentice, typesetter, and sometimes contributed under pen names. Several years later, Ben Franklin began publishing his own independent newspaper, the Pennsylvania His newspaper became the most popular in the Colonies and was published until 1800.  By 1735, the tenets of seditious libel were coming undone. John Peter Zenger, the publisher of the New York Weekly Journal, ran articles harshly critical of the colonial government. Zenger was arrested and tried for libel. While he admitted he published the articles, his lawyer argued truth was a defense. The press, the lawyer argued, has ``a liberty both of exposing and opposing tyrannical power by speaking and writing the truth.''  The judge, however, instructed the jury as to the law at the time, that Zenger must be found guilty if he published the articles, whether truthful or not, but after 10 minutes of deliberation, the jury acquitted These were some of the beginnings of a free press in our  The first rights in the Bill of Rights are freedom of religion, the press, speech, petition, and assembly. The press, as an institution, is expressly protected by the In 1789, the drafters of the Bill of Rights understood that a free press was essential to the growth and success of our new democracy. They understood that debate, disagreement, the free flow of ideas, make an informed public, that the press helps educate voters.  They understood all too well that government power needed to be checked and that the press holds the powerful in check by investigating and exposing arbitrary conduct, abuse, and corruption. A democracy cannot exist without a free press. It is as simple as that, but our President does not seem to understand this or he does not care. According to him, the press is ``dishonest,'' ``not good people,'' ``sleazy,'' and, ``among the worst human beings.'' Those are all quotes by our  Established press organizations are the ``fake news,'' and a few weeks ago he declared the press ``an enemy of the people.'' We have not heard attacks like this since Watergate, and even then, it wasn't so much so fast. The President's subordinates are now given license to accuse and to limit press access.  Chief Strategist Steve Bannon said the press should ``keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.'' This quote from Mr.Bannon has extra significance today because he is no longer the head of a rightwing media company. In a controversial move, President Trump issued an Executive order to add him to the National Security Council's Principal's  Today, we are going to vote on the nomination of General McMaster to retain his three-star general status while serving as the head of the National Security I do not believe a political extremist like Mr.Bannon should serve on the At a minimum, General McMaster should direct Mr.Bannon to stop attacking the free press while serving on the  Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway called for media organizations to fire reporters who criticized Candidate Press Secretary Shawn Spicer barred the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed, and Politico from a press conference, and the Secretary of State will now travel without the press corps, disregarding a decades-old practice.  Now, don't get me wrong. The press does not always get it right. They make mistakes. News organizations have their biases. Mistakes should be corrected and bias should be tempered by using accepted journalistic methods and professional judgment and following journalism's ethics code.  Mistakes and the exercise of professional judgment are not the same thing as reporting ``fake news.'' The President's Republican colleagues have been too silent in the face of attacks. Few in Congress have stood up against the President's hostility to the press. Government officials are afraid to disagree. Just last week, at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, I asked the FCC Chair, Mr.Pai, a yes or no question, does he agree with the President that the press is the enemy of the people.  He did not engage. He would not answer. He let stand the President's remarks. The President's characterization of the press as the enemy is reminiscent of President Nixon, when Nixon said: ``Never forget. The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy,'' as recorded on his secret tapes.  The press was Nixon's enemy because the press exposed his criminal conduct which led to his resignation. The press is Trump's enemy because the press exposes his and his associates' ties to[[Page S1820]]Russia, the President's myriad Trump organization conflicts of interest, his constant barrage of misrepresentations of fact.  Nixon's Press Secretary called the Washington Post investigative reporting shoddy and shabby journalism. Like President Trump's accusation of fake news, that same Post reporting won the paper a Pulitzer  Watergate was a break-in of the Democratic National Committee during the Presidential campaign. Nixon ordered his Chief of Staff to have the CIA block the FBI's investigation into the source of the funding for the Watergate burglary. During this last Presidential election, we had a cyber break-in of the Even after 17 U.intelligence agencies concluded Russia hacked the DNC to sway the election, Candidate Trump refused to accept their analysis.  The President's Chief of Staff pressured the FBI to publicly deny that Trump associates had contact with the Russians, while his Chief Counsel reportedly breached the firewall seeking information from the FBI about an investigation into the President and his associates. Since the press began to look hard at the ties between President Trump and the Trump organization, his associates and Russia, the President has not let up on his criticism. Just last week, the President threatened by tweet as follows:       It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard      working representatives. Be nice, you will do much better!  The job of the press is not to be nice. It is to gather the facts and report them. Now that the President of the United States has called the reputable U.news organizations fake news, others are doing the same. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman recently accused a CNN reporter of spreading ``fake news'' because the reporter asked about accusations from U.officials that the Russian Ambassador is a spy.  This is a dangerous path. Putin has throttled an independent press in the Russian Federation, imposing restriction after restriction on the news media. Reporters have been harassed, threatened, and jailed. The numbers of truly independent media organizations in Russia have been reduced to a very few, and they have been replaced by state-owned, state-run news media, like RT, formerly known as Russia Today, a propaganda bullhorn for Putin, according to Secretary John  The President admires Putin as a--and I will quote the President here--``strong leader.'' Putin has used his strength to silence an independent press. We do not want our press silenced.  Justice Brandeis, in a famous defense of free speech in a 1927 First Amendment case, said: ``[T]hose who won our independence by revolution were not cowards. They did not fear political liberty.''  Does President Trump fear political liberty?  The irony of the President's accusations of ``fake news'' is that he himself has spread misinformation and fanned the flames of internet-driven lies, from questioning President Obama's citizenship, to his frivolous claim that millions of people committed voter fraud and that he really won the popular vote--that is the President's claim, that he really won the popular vote--to President Trump's unsubstantiated accusation that President Obama wiretapped Trump  We have entered into an era in U.politics never seen before in my lifetime. We cannot allow this to be sanitized or explained away. The phrase ``alternative facts'' has become a national joke because it sounds like something from George Orwell's ``1984.''  It is not acceptable for a President to falsify, misrepresent, or flatout lie. The President's party in Congress should not allow this. They should not look the other way and continue to profess that the emperor's clothes are grand.  Reacting to Mr.Trump's attacks on the press, President George Bush responded:       I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy. We      need an independent media to hold people accountable. Power      can be very addictive and corrosive . . . and it's important      for the media to hold to account people who abuse their      power--whether it be here or elsewhere.  That was President George Bush's recent comment.  President Bush's prescription for democracy in 2017 is the same as the drafters of the First Amendment in 1789: A free and independent and robust media is essential to democracy, and any broad-based attack on the press is an attack directly on our democracy.  There is one thing President Trump must understand: The press won't go away. They won't stop reporting on the actions he takes and on the decisions he makes. He can spend the next 4 years attacking the press, but they will still be there--just as they were after Nixon resigned.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

In this Act:       (1) Advanced nuclear reactor.--The term ``advanced nuclear      reactor'' means--       (A) a nuclear fission reactor with significant improvements      over the most recent generation of nuclear fission reactors,      which may include inherent safety features, lower waste      yields, greater fuel utilization, superior reliability,      resistance to proliferation, and increased thermal      efficiency; or       (B) a nuclear fusion reactor.       (2) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the      Department of       (3) Licensing.--The term ``licensing'' means NRC activities      related to reviewing applications for licenses, permits, and      design certifications, and requests for any other regulatory      approval for nuclear reactors within the responsibilities of      the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.       (4) National laboratory.--The term ``National Laboratory''      has the meaning given that term in section 2 of the Energy      Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.15801).       (5) NRC.--The term ``NRC'' means the Nuclear Regulatory            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary      of     4. AGENCY       The NRC and the Department shall enter into the a      memorandum of understanding regarding the following topics:       (1) Technical expertise.--Ensuring that the Department has      sufficient technical expertise to support the civilian      nuclear industry's timely research, development,      demonstration, and commercial application of safe, innovative      advanced reactor technology and the NRC has sufficient      technical expertise to support the evaluation of applications      for licenses, permits, and design certifications, and other      requests for regulatory approval for advanced reactors.       (2) Modeling and simulation.--The use of computers and      software codes to calculate the behavior and performance of      advanced reactors based on mathematical models of their      physical behavior.       (3) Facilities.--Ensuring that the Department maintains and      develops the facilities to enable the civilian nuclear      industry's timely research, development, demonstration, and      commercial application of safe, innovative reactor technology      and ensuring that the NRC has access to such facilities, as      needed.     5. ADVANCED REACTOR REGULATORY       (a) Plan Required.--Not later than 1 year after the date of      enactment of this Act, the NRC shall transmit to Congress a      plan for developing an efficient, risk-informed, technology-     neutral framework for advanced reactor licensing. The plan      shall evaluate the following subjects, consistent with the      NRC's role in protecting public health and safety and common      defense and security:       (1) The unique aspects of advanced reactor licensing and      any associated legal, regulatory, and policy issues the NRC      will need to address to develop a framework for licensing      advanced reactors.       (2) Options for licensing advanced reactors under existing      NRC regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal      Regulations, a proposed new regulatory framework, or a      combination of these approaches.       (3) Options to expedite and streamline the licensing of      advanced reactors, including opportunities to minimize the      time from application submittal to final NRC licensing      decision and minimize the delays that may result from any      necessary amendments or supplements to applications.       (4) Options to expand the incorporation of consensus-based      codes and standards into the advanced reactor regulatory      framework to minimize time to completion and provide      flexibility in implementation.       (5) Options to make the advanced reactor licensing      framework more predictable. This evaluation should consider      opportunities to improve the process by which application      review milestones are established and maintained.       (6) Options to allow applicants to use phased review      processes under which the NRC issues approvals that do not      require the NRC to re-review previously approved information.      This evaluation shall consider the NRC's ability to review      and conditionally approve partial applications, early design      information, and submittals that contain design criteria and      processes to be used to develop information to support a      later phase of the design review.       (7) The extent to which NRC action or modification of      policy is needed to implement any part of the plan required      by this subsection.       (8) The role of licensing advanced reactors within NRC      long-term strategic resource planning, staffing, and funding      levels.       (9) Options to provide cost-sharing financial structures      for license applicants in a phased licensing process.       (b) Coordination and Stakeholder Input Required.--In      developing the plan required by subsection (a), the NRC shall      seek input from the Department, the nuclear industry, and      other public stakeholders.       (c) Cost and Schedule Estimate.--The plan required by      subsection (a) shall include proposed cost estimates,      budgets, and specific milestones for implementing the      advanced reactor regulatory framework by September 30, 2019.       (d) Design Certification Status.--In the NRC's first budget      request after the acceptance of any design certification      application for an advanced nuclear reactor, and annually      thereafter, the NRC shall provide the status of performance      metrics and milestone schedules. The budget request shall      include a plan to correct or recover from any milestone      schedule delays, including delays because of NRC's inability      to commit resources for its review of the design      certification applications.     6.

Unfortunately, an outdated and rigid regulatory regime will stifle new nuclear technology development. This bill will help modernize the regulatory framework for the 21st century to be adaptive, technology inclusive, and certainly predictable.  Advanced nuclear technologies may provide breakthroughs in safety and efficiency over the existing fleet of nuclear power plants. Absent the proper regulatory framework, our nuclear scientists and industry will look to other parts of the world to construct game-changing nuclear technologies. So the U.has to remain a global leader to create and maintain highly-paying and highly-skilled jobs right here at home.  This bill is a step towards ensuring that the NRC has the necessary expertise and the resources to be able to review and license new technologies and reactor designs, while appropriately collaborating with the Department of Energy's nuclear energy research programs and the private sector. With the Federal Government, national labs, universities, and private industry all working together towards a common goal, the future of nuclear industry energy is certainly bright.  In the last Congress, as I mentioned at the beginning, this legislation passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee and passed the House by a voice vote. I am pleased to support this legislation again, as part of our efforts to address burdensome regs that stifle economic growth and new technologies. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

Five years ago, Congress passed a bipartisan law that included a commonsense provision giving the States flexibility to drug test some applicants for unemployment insurance.  Instead of following the law Congress passed and allowing--not requiring--States to implement the policies right for their citizens, the Obama administration decided to tie States' hands. It issued a regulation that left no flexibility for States, the opposite of the bipartisan law Congress passed.  Mr.Speaker, frankly, it is sad that we are even here today. This all could have been avoided if the Obama administration had simply followed the congressional intent, but yet here we are.  I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

3274,topic-id,1012,"Mr.President, first of all, I thank my friend the Senator from Texas for giving me the courtesy of letting me get in my comments about the nomination of former Senator Dan Coats to serve as the fifth Director of National Intelligence, a position recommended by the 9/11 Commission and established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.  Dan Coats is a friend of mine and many in this body. He represented Indiana in both the U.House and for separate terms in the U.He was also U.Ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005. As mentioned, for 6 years I served with the nominee on the Senate Select Committee on I have always found Dan to be fairminded and know him to be an advocate for strong oversight of the intelligence community. He believes in the need for intelligence that is timely, relevant, and free of political interference.  During my private meeting with him, as well as during his confirmation hearing, Senator Coats committed to find and follow the truth, regardless of where it leads, agreeing that his primary job will be ``to speak truth to power,'' to the President, to policy and military leaders, and to Members of I know these are traits he will continue to employ if confirmed as the next Director of National  During James Clapper's most recent tenure as the DNI, in 6 years he put in place some fundamental changes in how the Intelligence community operates. He reoriented the Office of the DNI to focus on intelligence integration with an emphasis on mission. He often was willing to roll up his sleeves and take on the hard challenges of trying to get the intel community to operate on the same IT backbone systems. If confirmed, I have encouraged Senator Coats to build upon former Director Clapper's efforts, which are critical to ensuring that policymakers, warfighters, law enforcement, and national security officers receive intelligence products that are timely, relevant, and objective.  Of course, if confirmed, Director Coats will take on the job as the Nation's chief intelligence officer, leading the intelligence community during a very difficult time because unfortunately this President, along with his closest advisers, has repeatedly and unfairly disparaged the professionalism and actions of the Nation's intelligence professionals. These are men and women who maintain the highest standards of professionalism and integrity. They anonymously sacrifice for the country, often in the face of grave personal danger.  As DNI, Senator Coats is committed to defending the values and integrity of the men and women of the intelligence community, even when the White House may not like to hear it.  Another challenge Senator Coats will face on his first day on the job is to effectively support the Senate Intelligence Committee's ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election. Last week, I went to CIA headquarters in Langley, along with a number of other Members of the committee, to review the beginnings of the raw intelligence that led the community to conclude that Russia massively interfered in our last Presidential election. Both in public and in private, Senator Coats has promised he will support the committee's investigation to the fullest. We will hold him to that commitment.  On this topic, I want to reiterate on the Senate floor what I have already said numerous times. This investigation is not about being a Democrat or Republican nor about relitigating the 2016 election. The investigation is about upholding the core values and sanctity of democracy that all Americans hold dear. It is also about holding Russia accountable for their improper interference in our elections and arming our allies--one of which has an election today--with information about the means employed by Russia in our elections so they can use that information to protect the integrity of their own electoral process.  We will work to ensure that this critical investigation is done right, done in a bipartisan manner, free of any political interference, and as the chairman and I have both reiterated, that it follows the facts wherever they may lead.  I have every reason to believe Senator Coats will be forthcoming in supporting this investigation. If at any point it becomes clear to me that the Senate Intelligence Committee is unable to keep up these commitments, I am prepared to support another process.  Finally, let me acknowledge two other things.  During Senator Coats' confirmation hearing, he was asked about his role on the National Security Council, including the Principals He assured us that he will be attending these meetings and participating in them despite the confusion created by an Executive order that appeared to disinvite the DNI from these meetings. If he is not included in these meetings, I will expect to know about it and the reason why.  Senator Coats has also committed to me personally and to the committee that he will not support the return of waterboarding and other so-called enhanced interrogation practices, nor will he support reestablishing secret detention sites into the activities of the intelligence community. He reassured the committee that he will follow the law as it now stands and that he will not advocate for changes to the law or recommend a reinterpretation of the law based on any personal beliefs. The law is clear: No interrogation techniques outside the Army Field Manual are allowed.  Finally, Senator Coats has also reassured me and all of the members of the committee that if confirmed, he will always present to the President, to his Cabinet advisers, and to those of us in Congress the unvarnished facts as represented by the best judgments of the intelligence community whether or not that analysis is in agreement with the views of the President, with ours in Congress, or with anyone else's who might receive them.[[Page S1813]]  For these reasons, I support the movement.

3244,topic-id,3538,"Mr.President, we are gathered here this evening to seek to defend against the Congressional Review Act effort to overturn the clean stream protection rule. It is interesting that this first Congressional Review Act measure that we are taking up should be one that puts money into the pockets of the fossil fuel industry and lifts their obligation to clean up public streams that they have ruined with their pollution.  As I have been in the Senate, I am in my second term, and I am more than halfway through it. By Senate standards, I don't expect that is very senior, but it is enough that I have seen some patterns develop.  One of the patterns I have seen develop is that my friends on the other side of the aisle talk a really good game on deregulation, on regulatory reform. They give speeches on the burden of undue regulation. They give speeches about the cost of regulation. Over and over they seek deregulation. But when it comes time to actually do something, every single time that I can remember, the deregulatory effort goes to the benefit of two groups. One is Wall Street and the other is polluters. The rest is just talk.  Sure enough, here we are with the first Congressional Review Act effort, and the choices are money in the fossil fuel company's pockets versus our natural heritage of clean streams for ourselves and our children. And which way do we go? Put the money in the fossil fuel pockets--to heck with the clean streams. This would be 0.3 percent of coal industry revenues to clean up after the mess they have made.  I grew up and I was taught that if you spill something, you clean it up. If you make a mess, you clean it up. But in this building, if it is the fossil fuel industry, if you make a mess, too bad, we will take care of you. You are our guys. We don't care about the stream. We don't care about the people who live downstream. We don't care about people who might fish in it. We don't care about the fact that this is God's creation. We care about making the coal companies happy.  It happens over and over. If it is not polluters, it is Wall If it is not Wall Street, it is polluters. As to all this talk about deregulation, watch where it goes--Wall Street and polluters. Here we are with the archetypical challenge between private benefit and public harm. The very purpose of government--even conservative commentators say--is to protect the public from being harmed by those who cause them harm as they pursue their private benefit. What could be more the case than coal waste polluting public streams? We don't care; we are going to go to bat for the coal companies. I tell you, there are special rules around here for the fossil fuel industry.  We heard President Trump's promises to drain the swamp of the outside influence of corporate special interests and lobbyists in our government. Well, particularly when it comes to fossil fuel interests, that oft-repeated promise seems to have evaporated in the murky haze of his transition. From the very outset, operatives of the Koch brothers and other fossil fuel interests have infiltrated his team.  Some of the biggest swamp alligators have floated up as his nominees to run federal agencies that protect our public health, that enforce our laws, that maintain our natural resources, and even those who carry out our international diplomacy. With all these nominations, the President isn't draining the swamp. He is filling it with exactly the kind of big special interests that most Americans voted to keep out.  Our Republican colleagues are jamming and stacking the confirmation hearings in a rush to fill in this swamp Cabinet before the American people can get a good look at the nominees. By the way, the byproduct of all of this is the swamp gas of climate denial.  A strong majority of voters polled since the election called on President Trump to do more to address global warming. So let us look at the record of this fossil fuel swamp  Today, we voted on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be our Secretary of Like President Trump, Tillerson and ExxonMobil have been talking out of two sides of their mouths about climate change. Sometimes Tillerson acknowledges climate change exists, pointing to a revenue-neutral carbon fee like the one I have introduced as the best way to address it. At other times, he plays up imagined scientific uncertainty and overestimates the costs of action. In 2012, Tillerson said:       I'm not disputing that increasing CO2 emissions      in the atmosphere is going to have an impact. It will have a      warming impact.  As far back as 2009, he backed a revenue-neutral carbon fee like the one I introduced as the best way to address the problem. But in 2013, he questioned whether we should do anything at all to slow climate change, asking: ``What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers?''  That is the climate deniers' false premise--that humanity will suffer from our solving a problem that they face.  In 2015, Tillerson told an ExxonMobil shareholder meeting that he thought the world should wait for science to improve before solving the problem of climate change. He couldn't find one State university in this country that would agree with him. He says that because it is the fossil fuel industry stall strategy. It is so ironic coming from the longtime head of ExxonMobil to say we should wait because it has been well documented by the Los Angeles Times, by Inside Climate News, and by others that ExxonMobil--despite conducting some of the leading climate science for decades--has played a devious role in undermining public understanding of these dangers.  For years, Exxon has underwritten a shadowy network of denial organizations--we have called it here on the Senate floor the web of denial--with the purpose of delaying any steps to reduce the use of fossil fuel. Between 1988 and 2005, ExxonMobil contributed over $16 million to a network of phony-baloney think tanks and pseudo-science groups that spread misleading and false claims about climate science. In response to public outrage about ExxonMobil's role in funding climate denial--it knew it had been caught--it claimed that it would stop and that it had stopped. But in 2015, ExxonMobil was still funneling millions to groups pedaling climate denial. According to its own publically available ``2015 Worldwide Global Giving'' report, over $1.6 million, or one-fifth of ExxonMobil's public information and policy research contributions went to organizations active in deceiving the public about climate change--groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the Hudson Institute, and the Manhattan  Under Tillerson's leadership, Exxon spent untold millions of dollars obstructing climate action and burying real science in a cloud of nonsense. The nonprofit research organization Influence Map found that ExxonMobil spent[[Page S606]]at least $27 million obstructing climate action in 2015 alone. This was after they had said publically that they would knock it off. Tillerson even fought his own shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies reports shareholders of ExxonMobil have introduced 62 climate-related resolutions over the past 25 years. Under his guidance, management has opposed every one of them.  Rex Tillerson once openly mocked a shareholder who asked about investing in renewables. Tillerson responded that renewable energy only survives on the backs of enormous government mandates that are not sustainable. ``We on purpose choose not to lose money,'' he said. Well, one of the ways they choose not to lose money is by spending huge amounts on a big, complex PR machine to churn out doubt about the real science and to protect the enormous market failure that forces the rest of us to pay for the cost of Exxon's carbon pollution. To say that renewable energy only survives on the backs of government mandates and subsidies is a bitter irony from the CEO of a company in an industry that has been calculated by the International Monetary Fund to get subsidies of $700 billion a year in the United States alone from not having to pay for the damage that its product causes.  Now, $700 billion a year is quite the subsidy. We heard this special brand of fossil fuel doublespeak in his confirmation hearing. ``The increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are having an effect,'' he said. ``Our ability to predict that effect,'' he continued, ``is very limited.''  Our ability to predict that effect is clearly established. The scientists who study our planet's climate system know that is the case. They understand that our carbon pollution has already driven unprecedented changes in the climate, and they know that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will bring rising temperatures, higher sea levels along our coast, a warmer and more acidic ocean, and changes in weather patterns.  None of this is subject to serious doubt in the scientific community. When asked whether he sees climate change as a national security issue, Tillerson replied, ``I don't see it as the imminent national security threat that perhaps others do.''  Well, let's talk about those ``others'' for a minute. They are the ``others'' who are in charge of defending our country and its interests, the people whose job it is to monitor global trends and prepare for future threats. They are intelligence and security experts like the former Director of the CIA, the Chair of President George Bush's National Intelligence Council, the former commander of the U.Pacific  The ``others'' include the top brass at the U.Department of Defense, which has in its Quadrennial Defense Reviews for years described climate change as a ``global threat multiplier.'' These ``others'' might just know what they are talking about, and they are not burdened with the conflict of interest of being the CEO of a company that is sponging a $700-billion subsidy off the American taxpayers every year. Perhaps the problem is that Mr.Tillerson is too steeped in the fossil fuel industry to hear the ``others'' who have dedicated their careers to defending the American people.  The United States ought to represent to the world a model of democratic leadership and honesty. That is how we get away with saying that we are a city on a hill. That is how we explain to the world that we hold up a lamp in its darkness. The telling responses from Mr.Tillerson's hearing matter because he will be the one to direct or abdicate America's global leadership on this critical issue.  We may be blind in this Chamber to the fact that the fossil fuel industry is calling the shots, pulling the strings, has control over our democracy, and is going around breaking our democratic checks and balances in order to seize control. But the rest of the world knows. You don't think the rest of the world can see why this body will do anything on climate change when every American State university knows that it is coming on, when every American scientific society knows that it is coming on, when our defense professionals know that it is coming on and warn us about it, when NASA and NOAA know that it is coming on and warn us about it?  You don't think that the people of Russia and China and Germany know that we are the ones who have a craft driving around on the surface of Mars? You don't think they know how good our scientists are, and you don't think they know that the NASA scientists are telling us climate change is serious, it is coming at us, it is going to be catastrophic if we don't act--we have to do something? They know that.  Everybody sees it. It is in plain view. What is missing is that Congress will not act because the tentacles of the fossil fuel industry swarm through this place. The world sees it and knows it and history will judge us for it.  Tillerson has spent his career leading an international oil company that has been consistently and fundamentally dishonest with the world as to what ExxonMobil knew about climate change. His professional life has been centered on extracting--extracting fossil fuels from the earth, extracting drilling concessions from corrupt regimes, extracting special tax favors from Congress, and extracting profits for his shareholders.  Well, American leadership in a dangerous world is about more than that. That is why I could not support his nomination. He is just one of several individuals nominated by President Trump who cannot accept the science of climate change or who harbors close ties to the fossil fuel industry or both--usually.  Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt is Trump's nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the bureau most directly responsible for leading the U.effort to stave off the effects of climate change. Mr.Pruitt has such deep political and financial ties to fossil fuel companies and front groups that it is hard to tell where they give off and he begins. He has served as the industry's mouthpiece and attack dog for years.  When he was asked during his Environment and Public Works Committee confirmation hearing to explain his dealings with the fossil fuel industry through secretive, dark money groups that he operated, which have been tied to specific companies he would be charged with regulating should he be confirmed, he provided misleading, incomplete, and evasive answers.  So we submitted substantive followup questions, asking him to set the record straight. Once again, he chose to provide evasive and empty responses. Right now, his record is a black hole of special interest secrecy about his dark money links to the fossil fuel industry. That ought not to be acceptable to anybody in the  We have a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on administration nominations. Any Senator who believes that Congress should have a role in overseeing this administration should take note of this. In response to questions following up on Pruitt's hearing, rather than providing information sought by the committee, he instructed the Senate to file open records act requests for the information with the State of  If Pruitt is willing to tell Senators who are poised to vote on his nomination to go to the back of a very long, first-come, never-served line to learn more about his conflicts of interest, I can hardly imagine how unresponsive he will be when Congress asks for information about changes he wants to make to the renewable fuel standard, changes he wants to make to clean air protections, changes he wants to make to our clean water protections or to toxic regulations.  By the way, he has stonewalled for more than 2 years, producing 3,000 emails between him and his office and identified fossil fuel companies and front groups--stonewalled an open records request for 2 years. His office admits there are at least 3,000 of them. Of the 3,000 emails between him and the fossil fuel industry that his office has admitted exist, how many do you suppose he has produced for the Environment and Public Works Committee--out of 3,000? Pick a number. I will tell you what the number is: zero; not one.  The party that for a long time had a really determined interest in emails suddenly has no interest in these emails at all. Emails? What emails? If it is fossil fuel companies on the other end of the emails, suddenly it does not matter. Pruitt does not want the Senate and the American people to know[[Page S607]]about his dealings with his polluter patrons. But we should know. It is our job to know. The public should know--but not when it is fossil fuels.  President Trump also nominated Senator Sessions of Alabama as Attorney General, the position responsible for enforcing Federal environmental laws, like the Clean Air He has invented the notion that the sky is not right in Alabama for solar power, saying, ``In my home State of Alabama, one would think we have a good bit of sunshine, but in truth, we have a lot of clouds, and solar is not effective in our area.''  In a 2015 interview with the Family Research Council, Senator Sessions said he was not even sure that global warming exists. That same year in a hearing with the EPA Administrator, Senator Sessions claimed that ``carbon pollution is CO2, and that's not really a pollutant; that's a plant food, and it doesn't harm anybody except that it might include temperature increases.''  This is the man who wants to be Attorney General of the United States, who says he is going to follow the law. There is a Supreme Court case on point that says carbon is a pollutant. What does he say? Carbon pollution is CO2, and it is not really a pollutant. That is just plain not the law.  By the way, try telling my Rhode Island fishermen, whose stocks are disappearing from the warming waters off our coast, that CO2 does not harm anybody. Trying telling it to Senator Merkley's shell fishermen in Oregon who have had shellfish hatcheries wiped out by acidified seas coming in.  I asked Senator Sessions at the confirmation hearing whether, as Attorney General, he would make decisions in environmental cases based on scientifically accepted facts. Senator Sessions, to his credit, responded that he would and said that the ``theory'' of global warming ``always struck me as plausible.''  Well, if he is confirmed, he will have to hold a lot of these fossil fuel companies accountable under our environmental laws, and I hope he will familiarize himself with the science that he committed to follow because I intend to hold him to his pledge.  Last, over at the Department of Energy, Trump chose former Governor Rick Perry of Texas, a one-time Presidential candidate who campaigned on eliminating altogether the Department he now hopes to lead. Perry also does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.  He has said:       Historically in Texas we've always had substantial periods      of drought. World temperatures have also been changing for      millennia. I truly believe the science is not settled on the      issue of man-made global warming.  Well, he had not checked with Texas universities when he said that. He was the Governor of He has not even checked with his own universities.  I went down to I had a hearing with climate scientists from the major Texas universities. They came in and said what they knew: It is real. It is coming. We are already seeing it. It is important. We have to get ahead of it. It is caused by We can solve that. Let's get to work.  It is not a complicated message. It is coming from his home-State universities.  Why would a Governor not follow the message of science developed and propagated by his own home-State universities? Why? Because the fossil fuel industry is so powerful that it will not let people recognize the truth. In the confirmation, Perry continued to hedge his bets. He said:       I believe the climate is changing. I believe some of it is      naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man-     made activity. The question is how do we address it in a      thoughtful way that does not compromise economic growth, the      affordability of energy or American jobs.  Well, if Governor Perry were actually being thoughtful about it, he would heed economic analyses like the Risky Business Project that show if we don't address climate change in a serious way, worsening storms, rising seas, warmer temperatures, and other extreme weather events will cost the United States billions of dollars. Just ask the insurance industry. In fact, ask our own CBO who testified today that these are concerns we need to look at.  President Trump's Cabinet nominees should be working for the American people. But their public records show that they are more likely to listen to the Koch brothers, to ExxonMobil, to Devon Energy, to Murray Energy, to the special interests and the fossil fuel industry, and that they will not listen to our military, they will not listen to our national labs, they will not listen to NASA, even though they have that rover driving around on Mars and presumably know a little something about science. They are more likely to protect the profits of polluters than protect the health of  Mr.President, there is too much at stake here to let Washington sink into the polluters' swamp. This whole scenario is an embarrassment to our country. It is going to be a lasting stain on our national reputation.  Bringing us back to this Congressional Review Act, here we go again. The Congressional Review Act action was brought to benefit coal company polluters at the expense of our natural heritage, our children, and our common good, just so they don't have to clean up the mess they left behind, just so they don't have to clean up ruined public streams. It is just the latest demonstration that in this Congress, fossil fuel is king, doesn't care for our future, doesn't care for anything but what goes into its own pockets, and it is a disgrace.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS605-3.txt,1823,ADVANCED NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2017,2017.0,1.0,January

I appreciate his concern that Medicaid can be managed by the States--and I think I used his words correctly--along with the money to[[Page S1796]]pay for it. But when the bill has $800 billion in Medicaid savings but will not cure or prevent a single illness, you are not reducing those $800 billion in savings; you are just moving it to the You are just putting that burden on the Ask Arizona how that worked when they tried to do Medicaid as they dealt with the mortgage meltdown.  The American people do perhaps demand better than ObamaCare, but the solution to offer them something that is far, far worse does not seem very sensible. I believe we are willing to work together. Indeed, in the HELP Committee our chairman has already said that as soon as we start talking about repair, we can get to work. But the notion that there is an invitation out to us to work in a bipartisan fashion when the majority party is jamming this bill through without negotiation, using reconciliation as an extraordinary process to try to put it through under arcane budget rules that were never designed for this--that is not exactly much of a signal. So as soon as we get to regular order and 60 votes, I think we will be able to actually work and serve our constituents very well.                             Climate Change  Mr.President, I am here today for my 160th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, this one focused on the security consequences of our failure to deal with carbon emissions and climate change.  My remarks at the Munich Security Conference this year pointed out that climate change presents several orders of security risk to society. The first order of security risk is just physical damage, damage that science and our senses are already perceiving and measuring in our atmosphere, our oceans, and our environment.  This security risk, risks to the Earth's present national state, will hurt farming communities, coastal communities, fishing communities, and of course anyone vulnerable to wildfires, droughts, and extreme weather. Of course, the poorer you are in this world, the more vulnerable you are to this peril.  The second order of security risk from climate change is the consequences in human society from that physical, biological, and chemical damage in our environment. As farms and fisheries fail, people are impoverished and dislocated. Scarce resources lead to conflicts and confrontations. Storms and fires can make suffering acute, and people who are hungry or dislocated or torn from their roots can become desperate, radicalized, and violent. That is why the U.Department of Defense has for years called climate change a catalyst of conflict.  Drought in Syria, for instance, has been described as a root cause of the conflict there, a conflict that has killed more than 400,000 people, according to some estimates, and displaced more than 11 million. Researchers from NASA and the University of Arizona have determined that drought was very likely the worst in a millennium. Massive crop failures and livestock losses moved farmers into stressed cities, where popular protests met with brutal violence from the Assad regime and the tide of refugees from that chaos swamped  Nigeria, Sudan, and Central America are other areas where violence and flight are driven by scarce resources. So the second order of national security risk is the societal damage that cascades from the natural damage caused by climate change.  The third order of security risk is perhaps the most dangerous for our country; that is, reputational damage to the keystone institutions of our present world order: market capitalism and democratic government. People around the world who have been harmed by the first-order environmental effects of climate change, or people around the world who get swept up in the second-order societal effects of climate change will want answers, as will many who are witness to the global suffering and harm caused by climate change.  When that reckoning comes, as it will, the discredit to institutions like capitalism and democracy which failed to act, even when loudly and clearly warned, could be profound. This failure of action by these institutions is compounded by the moral failure. Fossil fuel companies are knowingly causing this harm. They are aggressively fighting solutions to this problem. Their weapons are as disreputable as their conduct: professionally administered misinformation--climate denial, after all, is the original fake news--and massive, massive floods of political money.  As a result, the Congress has shown itself utterly unable to resist the threats and blandishments of this industry, despite the fact that we know very clearly of the industry's enormous conflict of interest. This all stands to be a lasting blot on both democracy and capitalism, a blot that will worsen as the consequences of our climate failure worsen. If you believe, as Daniel Webster did, in the power of America's example, that we are, indeed, a city on a hill, then you should worry about this terrible example of greed, ignorance, and corruption triumphant.  It is not like we have not been warned. The National Intelligence Council has estimated that worldwide demand for food, water, and energy will grow by approximately 35, 40, and 50 percent respectively in coming decades. This increased resource demand is on a collision course with those first-order harms--disrupting fisheries and agriculture around the globe.  The U.Institute for Peace has warned that ``poor responses to climatic shifts create shortages of resources such as land and water. Shortages are followed by negative secondary impacts, such as more sickness, hunger and joblessness. Poor responses to these, in turn, open the door to conflict.''  For those who discount this as a bunch of peaceniks' prattle, let me add that in 2013, our National Intelligence Council put climate change alongside events like nuclear war and a severe pandemic among the eight events with the greatest potential for global disruption--noting for climate change that ``dramatic and unforeseen changes are occurring at a faster rate than expected.'' The Department of Defense 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review described climate change as a ``global threat multiplier.'' That report warned that ``the pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world.''  As head of U.Pacific Command, ADM Samuel Locklear warned in 2013 that climate change was the biggest long-term security threat in his area of operation, noting the need to organize the military for ``when the effects of climate change start to impact these massive populations.''  Again, I will quote him. ``If it goes bad,'' he said, ``you could have hundreds of thousands or millions of people displaced and then security will start to crumble pretty quickly.''  Operation Free, a coalition of national security and veterans organizations, has continually pointed out the national security threat posed by climate change, as has the American Security Project, comprised of retired military flag officers. The Government Accountability Office, GAO, has warned that climate change is affecting defense infrastructure around the world, from sea level rise at Naval Station Norfolk to heavy rain and flooding at Fort Irwin, CA, to thawing permafrost affecting Air Force radar installations in Alaska, to faraway effects, even at Diego Garcia in the Indian  The Coast Guard, of course, must meet entirely new demands of the icecap's melt in the Arctic for transportation and shipping, for new fishing grounds, for resource exploration, and of course the possibility there of conflict. In 2005, when Defense Secretary Mattis led Marine Corps Combat Development Command, he called on Navy researchers to find ways to make the military more energy efficient, to ``unleash''--to use his words--U.military forces from the ``tether [of] fuel.''  Ask Senator Tammy Duckworth about the casualties sustained among her comrades in arms defending fuel supply lines if you want to see a passionate conversation. The military funds research into alternative energy and studies how climate change affects military capability because in the real world, where real lives are at risk, they can't afford to believe the false facts peddled by the fossil fuel industry.  The people we entrust to keep us safe, who have to deal with real threats in the real world, recognize the danger[[Page S1797]]climate change represents. The National Intelligence Council said in January that ``issues like . . . climate change invoke high stakes and will require sustained collaboration.'' Instead of that, we get a Congress and an administration that has deliberately let the fossil fuel industry occupy and sabotage the orderly operation of the Government of the United States to deal with this problem.  So I am going to start to push back. When these tools of the fossil fuel industry, to whom we in the Senate gave advice and consent, go too egregiously about their dirty business of climate denial, expect that I may come to the floor and object to consent requests.  Last week, Administrator Pruitt said carbon dioxide does not cause climate change. That is nonsense. That is somewhere between ignorant and fraudulent. He gets that one lie for free but no more--not next time with the stakes this high. It can't be free to have these fossil fuel tools spouting their fossil fuel nonsense from Senate-confirmed positions of governmental authority. Starting now, it will not be.  I yield the floor.

So this morning, given the fact that this legislation would be the top priority of Senator Coats, as he said in the Intelligence Committee, I want the Senate and the country to understand why this issue is so important.  First, I am happy to yield to my friend from  The PRESIDING The Senator from                           Order of Procedure  ",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgS1811-3.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,15.0,March
3282,topic-id,1332,"I thank my colleague.  Now, as we consider the nomination of Senator Coats, and recognize that his top priority, by his admission, would be the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--particularly section 702--I want to begin this discussion by saying that it is because the intelligence community has stonewalled Democrats and Republicans in both this body and in the other body for 6 years on the information that we need to do good oversight that I have come to the floor to outline what I think the central issue is all about.  I am going to begin my remarks by way of saying that, at a time when Americans are demanding policies that give them more security and more liberty, increasingly, we are seeing policies come from both this body and the other body that provide less of both.  A good example would be weakening strong encryption. Weakening strong encryption is bad from a security standpoint, and it is bad from a liberty standpoint. When government creates policies that give the American people less of both--less security and less liberty--obviously, the American people are not going to react well.  My view is that when the government--particularly intelligence agencies--don't level with the American people about large-scale surveillance of law-abiding Americans, our people are justifiably angry. When the government tries to keep this information secret--as I have pointed out on this floor before--in America, the truth always comes out. Leveling with the American people is the only way for agencies to have the credibility and the legitimacy to effectively do their jobs. They have critically important jobs in keeping our people safe from threats.  Now, with respect to Senator Coats, at his confirmation hearing, since he said the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be his top priority, I asked our former colleague how many Americans--innocent, law-abiding Americans--have actually been swept up in the surveillance program known as section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Under section 702, the government conducts warrantless surveillance of foreigners who are reasonably believed to be overseas. It does this work by compelling telecommunications companies and internet service providers to provide the content, phone calls, and emails, and other individual communications.  Now, there are several different ways this happens, and I will get to that in the course of these remarks. What we are talking about--what I want people to understand--is that this goes to the content of communications. This is not about metadata collection. Congress, as the Senate knows, reformed that in the USA FREEDOM This is surveillance without any warrants, and once the FISA Court signs off on the overall program, the details are up to the government.  Now, this was not always the case. For decades, individual warrants were required when the government needed the assistance of the country's telecommunications firms. Then the Bush administration created a secret, but legal, warrantless wiretapping program.  After the program was revealed, the government then went to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court to get approval. But when the government ran into some trouble with the court, the Bush administration argued that the Congress should create the current program. It was first passed in 2007 under the name Protect America That became the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act of 2008.  Now, fortunately, the Congress included a sunset provision, which is why it was up for reauthorization in 2012, and that is why it is up for reauthorization this year. This year it is Senator Coats' top priority, if confirmed. Whoever is the head of the intelligence community will be the point person for this legislation.  I want it understood that the reason that I am going through this background is that I believe the American people deserve a fully informed debate about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization. You cannot have that debate--you cannot ensure that the American people have security and liberty--unless you know the impact of section 702 of that bill on the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.[[Page S1815]]  So for 6 years, in this body, Democrats and Republicans--and in the other body, Democrats and Republicans--have been asking the same question: How many law-abiding Americans are having their communications swept up in all of this collection? Without even an estimate of this number, I don't think it is possible to judge what section 702 means for the core liberties of law-abiding Without this information, the Congress can't make an informed decision about whether to reauthorize section 702 or what kind of reforms might be necessary to ensure the protection of the individual liberties of innocent  At Senator Coats' nomination hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, I asked Senator Coats whether he would commit to providing Congress and the public with this information. I will say, because of my respect for Senator Coats and our longtime cooperation on issues like tax reform and a variety of others, I hoped that Senator Coats would be the one--after 6 years of struggling to get this information--to make a commitment to deliver it to the Senate Intelligence Committee before work on the reauthorization began. Instead, Senator Coats said: ``I will do everything I can to work with Admiral Rogers at the NSA to get you that number.''  If confirmed, I hope that happens. But after asking for the number of law-abiding Americans who get swept up in these searches for years, and getting stonewalled by the executive branch, hoping to get the information we need to do real oversight is just not good enough.  The problem--the lack of information on the impact of this law on the privacy of Americans--goes all the way back to the origins of the authority. In December of 2007, the Bush administration, in its statement of administration policy on the FISA Amendments Act, stated that it would likely be impossible to count the number of people located in the United States as communications were reviewed by the government. In April of 2011, our former colleague Senator Mark Udall and I then asked the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, for an estimate. In July of that year, the Director wrote back and said: ``It is not reasonably possible to identify the number of people located in the United States whose communications may have been reviewed under the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.''  He suggested reviewing the classified number of disseminated intelligence reports containing a reference to a U.person, but that is very different than the number of Americans whose communications have been collected in the first place. And that is what this is all about: How many law-abiding Americans--innocent, law-abiding Americans--are getting swept up in these searches? It will be an increasingly important issue as the nature of telecommunications companies continues to change, because it is now a field that is globally interconnected. We don't have telecommunications systems just stopping at national borders. So getting the number of Americans whose communications have been collected in the first place is the prerequisite to doing real oversight on this law and doing our job, at a time when it is being reauthorized and the American people want both security and liberty and understand that the two are not mutually exclusive.  So Director Clapper then suggested reviewing the classified number of targets that were later determined to be located in the United But the question has never been about the targets of 702, although the mistaken targeting of Americans and the people in our country is another serious question. The question that Democrats and Republicans have been asking is about how many Americans are being swept up by a program that, according to the law, is supposed to only target foreigners overseas.  So let me repeat that. That is what the law says. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act says that the targets are supposed to be foreigners overseas, and Democrats and Republicans want to know how many law-abiding Americans, who might reside in Alaska or Oregon or anywhere else, are getting swept up in these searches.

3337,topic-id,1497,"Mr.President, the Senate has been digging into the legal quagmire of drug testing the unemployed. I would like to begin by saying that no matter where a Senator comes down on the issue of drug testing, my view is that this measure before us is simply bizarre.  If, like me, you believe that drug testing is ineffective and mean-spirited, you ought to oppose this measure because it simply vilifies unemployed workers who are actually less likely to use drugs than the general population.  For those Senators who support drug testing, this measure blows up what has been a bipartisan compromise and a Labor Department rule allowing select testing to go forward. The result of this measure passing would actually be to block testing from going forward.  The fact is that the courts have ruled that suspicionless drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. That is why there is now actually a rule that is narrow.  We have the courts expressing skepticism about this, and there is actually a rule that is narrow so that, in effect, States that are doing this drug testing have what amounts to guardrails to avoid running afoul of the If you pass this measure, you will throw out the guardrails, opening up, in my view, the possibility of yet more litigation on Fourth Amendment grounds.  Now, as I touched on in my opening comments, there isn't evidence that unemployment insurance recipients use drugs any more frequently than the general population. In fact, studies actually indicate that they are less likely to use illegal drugs than the general population. So this idea that somehow there is a presumption of irresponsible conduct and guilt is just baseless.  To be eligible for unemployment insurance, workers have to have substantial recent work experience. They have to be unemployed through no fault of their own. Workers can only collect unemployment benefits if they are actively searching for work and available to work.  For States that have implemented drug testing policies, there is evidence that the costs dwarf the potential savings. The costs of operating drug testing programs are charged to State health and human services accounts, and I think we all understand that those have been squeezed mightily by the effort to treat opioid addiction. In my view, instead of wasting money by drug testing Americans who are looking for jobs, the States ought to be putting those very same dollars toward[[Page S1798]]substance abuse treatment, given the fact that opioid addiction has hit our country like a wrecking ball.  Moreover, we have said that fighting opioid addiction ought to be a bipartisan cause. If Republicans wanted to do everything possible to fight addiction, they shouldn't be going forward with TrumpCare, a bill that would be a disastrous setback when it comes to fighting opioid addiction. The fact is that colleagues on the other side of the aisle here in the Senate--colleagues not from my side but colleagues from the other side--have expressed their concern about what TrumpCare means for the fight against opioid addiction.  The hard numbers are actually out now on TrumpCare, and they show that the majority is going into overdrive to pass a bill that strips millions of Americans of their access to treatment for substance abuse. Today Medicaid is strengthening our mental health network, expanding access to substance use disorder treatment, and is at the forefront of some promising new work to fight opioid addiction. So TrumpCare hits the cause of treating opioid addiction in a devastating way. It slashes the healthcare safety net, and, in my view, it would inflame the epidemic of drug abuse deaths across the country.  At the same time, there is this partisan effort to slash funding for addiction treatment. Republicans have dredged up an old head-scratcher of an argument that drug testing Americans and denying them earned benefits somehow just magically helps to overcome addiction. This is an important point.  Just like Social Security, unemployment insurance is an earned benefit. It is an earned benefit that ought to be there for workers who fall on hard times.  So what the majority is pushing for in this debate looks to me like light years away from what was discussed last year when there was discussion before the election about helping Americans in every part of the Nation who are struggling with opioid addiction.  You have to ask this question: What earned benefits are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle going to crusade against next? Is the drug testing crusade going to turn next to Social Security and Medicare recipients as an excuse to deny seniors benefits that they have earned--earned benefits that they worked hard for through a lifetime of work?  I am going to wrap up by way of saying that, if this measure passes, I think States are just going to be thrown into bedlam. The current law, based on a compromise--a bipartisan compromise reached in 2012--says States can drug test recipients of unemployed benefits in two cases: first, if the unemployment insurance recipient lost their job for drug-related reasons and, second, if the unemployment insurance recipient is applying for a type of occupation that requires drug testing, as defined by the rules of the Department of  Let's say, for example, that two unemployment benefits recipients are specifically applying for jobs as schoolbus drivers or air traffic controllers. The rule that is on the books now says that States can drug test those individuals because they are applying for work in occupations that require drug testing.  Now, as far as I can tell, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to eliminate the rule that defined those occupations. States would be blocked from performing any occupation-based drug testing for unemployment recipients, and the States would just be walking into a legal minefield if they wanted to go ahead with testing programs anyway.  Make no mistake about it. When this passes--if it does--drug testing policies go on hold until the Congress passes a new law, rather than our continuing a carefully put together bipartisan compromise of just a couple of years ago.  I have been trying to see this from my colleagues' perspective. I have listened to the arguments from the other side. I just find this a baffling, bizarre kind of analysis. All this measure does is create a huge amount of new uncertainty. That doesn't strike me as a good way to reduce bureaucracy and make government more efficient.  If the majority decides to take another crack at this issue down the road, I can only guess at what kind of new ideas they might have that would, again, miss the point of making sure we had a narrow, defined, and bipartisan approach to deal with this issue.  My view is that this is an ill-conceived campaign against working people built on a completely false premise. The premise is that if you are looking for work, you are guilty of drug use until proven innocent. My view is that we ought to keep trying, as I have said, on major issues involving health and taxes and infrastructure and trade. When you are dealing with important questions, we should work to find the common ground. It is not about taking each other's bad ideas. It is about taking each other's good ideas.  My view is that what was done a few years ago was a good and narrowly tailored bipartisan idea. What the Senate may choose to do is basically to throw that in the trash can, create bedlam, and make it impossible for States to move because they are in a sort of legal limbo. I don't see how that meets the test of sound policy.  This measure before us today sets back the cause of strengthening the unemployment insurance system. It sets back the cause of advocating for Americans struggling with addiction. I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure when we vote here in a little bit.  I yield the floor.

3264,topic-id,374,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.42, and I thank Chairman Smith for taking the lead in fighting for American workers with this commonsense piece of legislation.  I believe there has been a misconception about the intent of this Congress is not acting because we have a malicious intent to punish American workers. We are not even trying to disincentivize them from participating in the program.  My colleague, Mr.Davis, said we should strengthen our programs, and what we are attempting to do is exactly that: strengthen the system that is intended to help unemployed Americans and allow them to prepare to reenter the workforce.  The 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made commonsense reforms to the unemployment insurance system with the goal of assisting Americans in returning to gainful employment. Yes, this included allowing States, like my own of Florida, to determine whether or not they wanted to include drug screening and test unemployment insurance applicants. And, yes, the law specifically stated two conditions: if the applicant had lost their job due to drug use and if they were seeking a new job that regularly required new employees to pass a drug test.  Now, when the Department of Labor drafted the rule, they clearly went beyond the intent of Congress and tailored it too narrowly. This will only hurt prospective employees in the long term.  The rule covers occupations such as those that require the employees to carry firearms, flight crews, transportation, and the like.                              {time}  1400  The problem here is that employers in occupations outside of this narrow scope also regularly require drug testing of their employees.  So under this rule, unemployed Americans who are using and looking for employment outside of the specific occupations outlined in the rule could potentially find employment in a different industry, be drug tested, and subsequently terminated.  How is this helping American workers? It doesn't make sense to me, and it shouldn't make sense to any of my colleagues either. This is a bad rule, and it needs to be repealed so the Department of Labor can go back to the drawing board and craft a rule that will actually strengthen the unemployment insurance, help the American worker, and ultimately strengthen the economy.
