                     PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REPORT CARD

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, here is President Trump's report 
card after less than a month in office:
  The President wants to stop terrorist attacks by conducting 
background checks on refugees from countries that are considered 
security threats.
  The President wants to prevent criminal immigrants from being 
released into our neighborhoods where they continue to prey on innocent 
Americans.
  The President wants to lower the cost of health care and let 
individuals choose their own insurance plans.
  The President wants to reduce our $500 billion trade deficit and 
export goods and services, not jobs.
  The President wants to eliminate unnecessary regulations which are a 
drag on the economy.
  Mr. Speaker, the President's critics oppose all these actions. Only 
the people are on the President's side.

                          ____________________
