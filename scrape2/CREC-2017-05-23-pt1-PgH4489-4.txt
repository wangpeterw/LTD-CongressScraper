                              MEMORIAL DAY

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this Monday, America honors its war 
dead. We call it Memorial Day.
  Many Americans do not realize that there are 25 United States 
cemeteries overseas for America's war dead. The one in Luxembourg is 
one that I have visited and I find quite unique.
  During World War II, in 1944, the Germans crushed through the 
American lines in a surprise attack. It was called the Battle of the 
Bulge. My 92-year-old father fought in that battle when he was 18.
  The German advance was eventually halted. One reason was because 
General George Patton and his army helped halt the attack by quickly 
advancing through and saving Luxembourg.
  After the war, the nation of Luxembourg agreed to a memorial there. 
The memorial is unique because the cemetery is a burial place for 
mostly Americans who were killed in the Battle of the Bulge. There are 
5,076 Americans buried there--22 sets of brothers. And the average age 
of the soldier buried in Luxembourg is 19.
  This Memorial Day, let us remember all who have served and have given 
their lives and are buried all over the world, because, Mr. Speaker, 
the worst casualty of war is to be forgotten.
  And that is just the way it is.
