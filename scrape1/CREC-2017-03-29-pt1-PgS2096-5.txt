                                 ______
                                 

 REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
  SIGNIFICANT MALICIOUS CYBER-ENABLED ACTIVITIES THAT WAS DECLARED IN 
              EXECUTIVE ORDER 13694 ON APRIL 1, 2015--PM 4

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694 
of April 1, 2015, is to continue in effect beyond April 1, 2017.
  Significant malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or 
directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside 
the United States, continue to pose an unusual

and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13694 with respect to significant malicious cyber-enabled 
activities.
                                                     Donald J. Trump.  
The White House, March 29, 2017.
