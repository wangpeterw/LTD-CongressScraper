SENATE RESOLUTION 362--RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF THE LOS ANGELES-CLASS 
     ATTACK SUBMARINE THE USS JACKSONVILLE AND THE CREW OF THE USS 
   JACKSONVILLE, WHO SERVED THE UNITED STATES WITH VALOR AND BRAVERY

  Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. Nelson) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 362

       Whereas the USS Jacksonville (SSN 699) is named after 
     Jacksonville, the largest and most populous city in Florida, 
     and is the first ship to bear that name;
       Whereas the slogan of the city of Jacksonville, Florida, is 
     ``The Bold New City of the South'' and inspired the nickname 
     of the USS Jacksonville, which is ``The Bold One'';
       Whereas, on August 10, 2017, the USS Jacksonville returned 
     to the home port of the USS Jacksonville at Joint Base Pearl 
     Harbor-Hickam in the Western Pacific after 209 days out to 
     sea, thus completing the 15th and final deployment of the USS 
     Jacksonville;
       Whereas, on the last deployment of the USS Jacksonville, 
     the USS Jacksonville steamed more than 48,000 nautical miles 
     while conducting--
       (1) maritime security operations in the areas of operation 
     of the Fifth Fleet and Seventh Fleet of the United States; 
     and
       (2) joint exercises with the Maritime Self-Defense Force of 
     Japan and the navy of the Republic of India;

       Whereas, since the commissioning of the USS Jacksonville on 
     May 16, 1981, the USS Jacksonville has completed 2 around-
     the-world cruises, visited ports on nearly every continent, 
     and completed countless critical missions; and
       Whereas, on September 11, 2001, while the USS Jacksonville 
     was attached to the Enterprise Battle Group, the USS 
     Jacksonville--
       (1) was in the Mediterranean Sea; and
       (2) stayed on-station to provide critical intelligence 
     support as the United States prepared to retaliate in 
     response to the terrorist attacks carried out on that day: 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the service of the Los 
     Angeles-class attack submarine the USS Jacksonville and the 
     crew of the USS Jacksonville, who served the United States 
     with valor and bravery.
