                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS

  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:

       POM-12. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature 
     of the State of South Dakota expressing support for, and 
     unity with, the State of Israel; to the Committee on Foreign 
     Relations.

                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 1014

       Whereas, the United States has long supported a negotiated 
     settlement leading to a sustainable two-state solution with 
     the democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized, 
     democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and 
     security; and
       Whereas, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 
     claims ``the establishment by Israel of settlements in the 
     Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East 
     Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant 
     violation under international law and a major obstacle to the 
     achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and 
     comprehensive peace''; and
       Whereas, by referring to the ``4 June 1967 lines'' as the 
     basis for negotiations, United Nations Security Council 
     Resolution 2334 effectively states that the Jewish Quarter of 
     the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall, Judaism's 
     holiest site, are ``occupied territory,'' thereby equating 
     these sites with outposts in the West Bank that the Israeli 
     government has deemed illegal; and
       Whereas, passage of United Nations Security Council 
     Resolution 2334 effectively lends legitimacy to efforts by 
     the Palestinian Authority to impose its own solution through 
     international organizations and through unjustified boycotts 
     or divestment campaigns against Israel, and will require the 
     United States and Israel to take effective action to 
     counteract the potential harmful impact of United Nations 
     Security Council Resolution 2334; and
       Whereas, the Obama Administration's decision not to veto 
     United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 is 
     inconsistent with long-standing United States policy and 
     makes direct negotiations more, not less, challenging; and
       Whereas, Israel has been granted her lands under and 
     through the oldest recorded deed, as recorded in the Old 
     Testament scriptures held sacred and revered by Jews and 
     Christians alike, as presenting the acts and words of God; 
     and
       Whereas, the claim and presence of the Jewish people in 
     Israel has remained constant throughout the past four 
     thousand years of history; and
       Whereas, the legal basis for the establishment of the 
     modern state of Israel was a binding resolution under 
     international law, which was unanimously adopted by the 
     League of Nations in 1922 and subsequently affirmed by both 
     houses of the United States Congress; and
       Whereas, this resolution affirmed the establishment of a 
     national home for the Jewish people in the historical region 
     of the land of Israel, including the areas of Judea, Samaria, 
     and Jerusalem; and
       Whereas, Article 80 of the United Nations Charter 22 
     recognized the continued validity of the rights granted to 
     states or peoples which already existed under international 
     instruments, and therefore the 1922 League of Nations 
     resolution remains valid, and the six hundred fifty thousand 
     Jews currently residing in the areas of Judea, Samaria, and 
     eastern Jerusalem reside there legitimately; and
       Whereas, Israel declared its independence and self-
     governance on May 14, 1948, with the goal of reestablishing 
     its God-given and legally recognized lands as a homeland for 
     the Jewish people; and
       Whereas, the United States, having been the first country 
     to recognize Israel as an independent nation and as Israel's 
     principal ally, has enjoyed a close and mutually beneficial 
     relationship with Israel and her people; and
       Whereas, there are increasing incidents of anti-Semitism 
     around the world, including across the United States 
     reflected in official hate crime statistics; and
       Whereas, the international boycott, divestment, and 
     sanctions movement is one of the main vehicles for spreading 
     anti-Semitism and advocating for the elimination of the 
     Jewish State; and
       Whereas, the dramatic increase in boycott, divestment, and 
     sanctions campaign activities on college campuses around the 
     country has resulted in increased animosity and intimidation 
     against Jewish students, negatively impacting student 
     programming related to the State of Israel and politics in 
     the Middle East; and
       Whereas, leaders of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions 
     movement say their goal is to eliminate Israel as the home of 
     the Jewish people; and
       Whereas, messaging at anti-Israel rallies has adopted the 
     boycott, divestment, and sanctions slogan: ``from the river 
     to the sea Palestine will be free'' which means that there 
     would be no Israel between the Jordan River and Mediterranean 
     Sea and that the State of Israel will cease to exist; and
       Whereas, Israel is the greatest friend and ally of the 
     United States in the Middle East and the values of our two 
     nations are so intertwined that it is impossible to separate 
     one from the other; and
       Whereas, a strong and independent Israel supports our long 
     cherished beliefs of democracy and liberty which we believe 
     is the right of all mankind; and
       Whereas, there are those in the world who have continually 
     sought to destroy Israel, from the time of its inception as a 
     state, and those same enemies of Israel also hate, and seek 
     to destroy, the United States; and
       Whereas, the promise of the God of Israel, who is the 
     Creator acknowledged in our own Declaration of Independence 
     and referenced by our own Founding Fathers in the creation of 
     our nation, is that He will bless those who bless Israel. Let 
     it be known that the State of South Dakota openly blesses 
     Israel with our friendship and that we stand in support of 
     the Israeli people and celebrate our many culture ties and 
     gratitude for our cordial and mutually beneficial relations 
     since 1948, a friendship that continues to strengthen with 
     each passing year: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the Ninety-
     Second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate 
     concurring therein, that the Legislature calls on Congress 
     and President Donald J. Trump to oppose and counteract United 
     Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 against Israel by 
     all means necessary; and be it further
       Resolved, That South Dakota stands proudly with Israel and 
     thanks our only Middle East democracy, for Israel's cordial 
     and mutually beneficial relationship with the United States 
     and with the state of South Dakota. We stand in support of 
     Israel in its legal, historical, moral, and God-given right 
     of self-governance and self-defense of the entirety of its 
     own lands. We recognize that Israel is neither an attacking 
     force nor an occupier of the lands of others, and that peace 
     in the Middle East for us, is contingent on a whole and 
     united Israel; and be it further
       Resolved, That the chief clerk of the House of 
     Representatives prepare copies of this resolution and forward 
     them to the President of the United States, the speaker and 
     clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the 
     president and secretary of the United States Senate, and the 
     Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., for transmission to the 
     proper authorities in the State of Israel.
                                  ____

       POM-13. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature 
     of the State of South Dakota expressing support for, and 
     unity with, the State of Israel; to the Committee on Foreign 
     Relations.

     security; and

     Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant
