                       SALUTE TO MEALS ON WHEELS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today commemorates the 
15th anniversary of March for Meals. This month-long grassroots 
campaign seeks to raise awareness about senior hunger and isolation. It 
also celebrates the proven private-public partnership of government, 
local community organizations, businesses, and compassionate 
individuals coming together to ensure that America's seniors are not 
forgotten.
  As chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, I know how 
important this program is to seniors across America. One in six seniors 
might not know where their next meal is coming from.
  But on March 22, 1972, President Nixon signed into law a measure that 
establishes a national nutrition program for seniors 60 years and 
older.
  For nearly 45 years, these critical programs--commonly referred to as 
Meals on Wheels--have delivered more than just nutritious meals to 
homebound seniors in virtually every community across the country.
  Meals on Wheels programs have come together each March, since 2002, 
to celebrate this proven collaboration of local community 
organizations, businesses, all levels of government, and compassionate 
individuals to ensure their seniors are not forgotten.
  Thank you to everyone who works to help our seniors live healthy 
lives.
