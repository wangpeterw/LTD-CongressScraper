                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week marks National 
Small Business Week, a time to recognize the remarkable contributions 
small businesses make creating jobs.
  In South Carolina, small businesses represent 99 percent of our 
State's businesses, employing 47 percent of our citizens. I am grateful 
for the input from the National Federation of Independent Business, 
NFIB, led by Ben Homeyer; the State Chamber of Commerce led by Ted 
Pitts; and local chambers from Barnwell to Blythewood and from North 
Augusta to northeast Columbia, promoting every corner of the district.
  When I meet with members of the small-business community of South 
Carolina, I learn how government regulations and government overreach 
threaten their businesses and reduce job opportunities.
  I support President Trump's commitment to creating jobs and how, in 
only 100 days, his administration has proven to be a champion of small 
business by cutting harmful regulations and outlining tax reform.
  I appreciate the leadership of the small-business administrator, 
Linda McMahon, and her advocacy for the 29 small businesses nationwide.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
