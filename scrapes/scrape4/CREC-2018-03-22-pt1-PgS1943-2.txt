                 REMEMBERING RICHARD E. ``DICK'' HAINES

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I have the honor of remembering Mr. 
Richard E. ``Dick'' Haines as he is laid to rest at the Western Montana 
State Veterans Cemetery with full military honors on April 6, 2018.
  Dick was born in Billings, MT, on September 28, 1936, and spent much 
of his life in service to our great State. Dick graduated from Montana 
State University in 1959 with a degree in mechanical engineering, while 
also completing the Army's ROTC program. After serving in the U.S. Army 
as an officer teaching marksmanship skills and shooting on Army rifle 
teams, Dick began his engineering career. In 1962, he was offered an 
engineering position with the U.S. Forest Service. During his career, 
he served on the Kootenai, Kaniksu, Clearwater, Deer Lodge, and 
Siskiyou Forests. His years of public service, however, did not stop 
there. From 1999 through 2004, Dick served in the Montana State House 
of Representatives, where he played a key role in the establishment of 
the Western Montana State Veterans Cemetery. In addition, he served a 
total of 8 years on the Missoula City Council and served for countless 
years with many other local organizations.
  When Dick wasn't serving his constituents or volunteering, he enjoyed 
Montana's beautiful outdoor recreational activities, including hunting, 
fishing, hiking and backpacking. His selfless public service and 
commitment to volunteering will never be forgotten.
