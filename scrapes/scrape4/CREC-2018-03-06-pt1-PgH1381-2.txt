                     LIMIT SCOPE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the special counsel investigation 
has pushed way beyond its authorized purpose.
  Recent reports indicate that individuals have been questioned about 
President Trump's business activities prior to his entering the 2016 
campaign. The private interests of Trump family members also are being 
probed.
  These lines of investigation clearly violate the scope of the special 
counsel, which is limited to: ``. . . any links and/or coordination 
between the Russian Government and individuals associated with the 
campaign . . .''
  In the interest of justice, the investigation must be limited. The 
Deputy Attorney General should do so immediately to ensure a fair 
process.
  A rogue investigation should not be allowed to continue.
