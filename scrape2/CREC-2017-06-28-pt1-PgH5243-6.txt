                    STREAMLINING PERMITTING PROCESS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week, in the Natural Resources 
Committee, we passed my bill, H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters Act, 
called the GO Act. It will help people be able to access public lands, 
national parks, U.S. Forest Service land, and BLM land for recreational 
activities without the litany and long wait of having to get permits. 
This will streamline that process.
  A couple of aspects include getting all the different agencies to 
work together to have a one-stop permitting process and shorten the 
length of time it takes to get these permits so that people can have 
events that are compatible with the use of these public lands and enjoy 
them. Indeed, no one is trying to hurt the environment, and we don't 
need a 6-month study every time somebody wants to have a bikefest or a 
jog through their public lands.

  We think the GO Act will be a very important, helpful tool, 
especially during the summertime, when people like to get outdoors and 
enjoy their public lands.
