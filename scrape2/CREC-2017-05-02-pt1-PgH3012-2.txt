         HONORING THE LIFE OF REVEREND DR. NORMAN LEE ROBINSON

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Reverend 
Dr. N.L. Robinson, the longtime pastor of Mount Olive Baptist Church 
who passed away last Friday.
  Reverend Robinson proudly served our Nation in the Army during World 
War II and was honorably discharged on November 25, 1945. It was during 
his time of service that he found spiritual enlightenment in Jesus 
Christ and his passion to serve the community.
  After leaving the Army, Reverend Robinson worked for the Dallas 
Housing Authority from 1946 until he retired in 1976.
  A graduate of the Southern Bible Institute of Dallas, Dr. Robinson 
began his ministry at St. John Missionary Baptist Church in Grand 
Prairie in 1962, and he was also the pastor very briefly at the Lucille 
Baptist Church in Palmer, Texas, before jointing Mount Olive in 1966.
  Under his guidance, Mount Olive grew to become a 12,000-member 
church. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that everybody, from the workers 
that built the cars at the General Motors plant in Arlington to one of 
the past mayors of Arlington, has been a member at that church 
throughout time.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Reverend N.L. 
Robinson, whose spiritual leadership touched so many lives in the 
Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington community.
