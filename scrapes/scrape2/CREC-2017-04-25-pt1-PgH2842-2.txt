                   HONORING THE LIFE OF SHARON GIESE

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of 
Sharon Giese. Sharon passed away unexpectedly in Arizona last week, a 
few short days after the death of her husband, Burt.
  Sharon was a respected, admired, and cherished member of our 
community. She had a long history of promoting conservative principles, 
and everyone she touched will miss her steady voice. Sharon Giese was a 
steadfast icon of the conservative movement in Arizona and a former 
Republican National Committeewoman.
  Mr. Speaker, I pray that the family of Burt and Sharon will receive 
peace in remembering their lives of purpose and distinction. These two 
individuals made a difference for Arizona and for the causes they 
dedicated themselves to. Burt and Sharon left behind a wonderful legacy 
for their family, community, church, and State.
  Like Sharon, we do not have knowledge of the moment of our life's 
final breath, but we are exhorted to run with endurance the race that 
is set before us. Sharon Giese ran her race with an abundance of 
endurance and inspired countless individuals around her. Her example 
will be celebrated and her loss mourned.
