                        IT IS THE MEDIA'S CHOICE

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the liberal national media have two 
choices.
  First, they can continue their dislike--some would call it hatred--of 
President Trump that results in severely slanted coverage. This is the 
road to self-destruction. The media's credibility has hit a record low, 
and the American people soon will stop looking to them for news.
  Or, second, the liberal national media can start covering President 
Trump objectively. This means not portraying his actions in the worst 
possible light but sometimes giving President Trump the benefit of the 
doubt. It means giving his side of the story. It means, most of all, 
recognizing that President Trump represents the legitimate hopes and 
fears of millions of Americans.
  If the liberal national media continue to treat President Trump 
unlike they would a Democrat, the public will grow tired of the double 
standard.
  The American people have an innate sense of fairness, which the media 
should not ignore. For their own sake and for the sake of our 
democracy, the media should change their ways.
