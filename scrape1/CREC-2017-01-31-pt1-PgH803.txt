                     NO WALL ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER

  (Mr. O'ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. O'ROURKE. Madam Speaker, we have the lowest levels of northbound 
apprehension coming across our southern border in modern history. We 
have more Mexican nationals going south to Mexico today than coming 
north to the United States. We have less than zero migration from 
Mexico.
  In El Paso, Texas, the border community is the safest city in the 
United States. On top of that, there has been not a terrorist, 
terrorist plot, or terrorist organization that is connected to our 
border with Mexico.
  But just in case, we are being vigilant. We are spending $19 billion 
a year to secure that border. There are 20,000 brave members of the 
Border Patrol who patrol every inch of that 2,000-mile border.
  Madam Speaker, we do not need a wall on our southern border. It is a 
waste of time. It is a waste of resources, and it takes our eye off of 
the real threats to this country.
  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in opposing a wall 
from this new administration.
