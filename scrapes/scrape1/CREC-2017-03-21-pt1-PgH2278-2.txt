                   PUTTING LIVES AT RISK WITH REPEAL

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today gravely concerned for the 
lives put at risk by the Republicans' repeal scheme. Trump has flip-
flopped on his promises to the American people.
  I recently heard from a person named Nancy who lives in my district. 
Nancy said: I am not asking for a handout. I have been a gainfully 
employed taxpayer for close to 40 years.
  Nancy was able to pursue her dream of opening her own small business 
because she could finally afford her own health care.
  This bill breaks Trump's promise to Nancy and to millions of 
Americans. It does not lower deductibles or drug prices, and it doesn't 
provide better coverage. Instead, they are purposefully taking away the 
health insurance from 24 million Americans by cutting $170 billion from 
Medicare and $880 billion from Medicaid.
  Why are they doing this?
  Simply to give a $600 billion tax cut to millionaires. Let me be very 
clear. This bill hurts kids, women, families, working people, the 
disabled, and seniors.
