          CONGRATULATING THE SHABAZZ HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Shabazz High 
School Bulldogs football team for winning their State championship game 
against the Weequahic High School Indians. These schools--both in my 
neighborhood and in my district--have been rivals since 1938.
  This is the second year in a row that they have gone head to head in 
the championship, but this year Shabazz beat Weequahic with a score of 
35-0 to win the State championship for north Jersey, section 2, group 
1. The Shabazz Bulldogs had a perfect season, finishing the year with a 
12-0 record. It was their first perfect season since 1966.
  The Shabazz Bulldogs were led to victory by Coach Darnell Grant, 
whose brother Barris Grant coached the Hillside High School Comets 
football team to its State championship this year as well. Both teams 
are in my district.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coach 
Grant and the Shabazz High School Bulldogs football team for their 
perfect year in sports this weekend.
