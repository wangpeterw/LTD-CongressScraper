    RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF SNAPa IN THE LIVES OF STUDENTS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I will meet 
with leaders from the School Nutrition Association of Pennsylvania, 
commonly known as SNAPa, which is a statewide organization of school 
nutrition professionals.
  SNAPa works to advance quality child nutrition programs through 
education and advocacy. Organized in 1955, SNAPa is an all-volunteer 
board of directors elected by its membership, which currently stands at 
more than 2,300 individuals. As chairman of the Agriculture 
Subcommittee on Nutrition and a senior member on the House Committee on 
Education and the Workforce, I know the essential services that SNAPa 
works to provide. Students throughout the Commonwealth receive high-
quality, low-cost meals thanks to SNAPa.
  Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember that, for some students, the 
only meal they may receive may be at school. This organization works to 
keep our children healthy and ensure that they have healthy food 
options through the school meal programs.
  I look forward to speaking with Travis Folmar, a food services 
director from State College. I sincerely thank SNAPa for advancing the 
availability, quality, and acceptance of school nutrition programs as 
an essential part of education in Pennsylvania for more than 60 years.
