                  DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION

  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the President recently disclosed 
highly sensitive information to Russian officials, information that had 
been entrusted to the United States by an ally. This incident has 
generated concern among national security professionals.
  Under current law, the President must keep the congressional 
intelligence committees informed of U.S. intelligence activities. 
Building on this general mandate, I am filing a bill that would require 
the President to notify the intelligence committees when a U.S. 
official, including the President, intentionally or inadvertently 
discloses top-secret information to a nation that sponsors terrorism 
or, like Russia, is subject to U.S. sanctions.
  My bill would deter unjustified disclosure of sensitive information 
to adversaries. It would also give the congressional intelligence 
committees an opportunity to examine the rationale for the disclosure, 
to assess any fallout, and to take appropriate action.
  My bill would simply provide Congress with the same information that 
was made available to other nations. I hope my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle will support this bill.
