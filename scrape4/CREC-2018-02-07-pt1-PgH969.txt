                  HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS DAY, JR.

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Thomas 
Day, Jr.
  Thomas loved spending time with his four kids, Whitney, Candice, 
Kelsey, and Nolan, and his two grandkids. He loved boating with his 
family, cheering for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and coaching Little 
League baseball.
  He worked as an estimator for Portrait Construction for more than 20 
years and was very personable and friendly with everyone he met. His 
children's friends called him ``Daddy Day''.
  Thomas will be remembered by all those who knew him as a fun-loving 
and amazing family man.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Thomas Day's family and 
friends, and please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of 
Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.

                          ____________________
