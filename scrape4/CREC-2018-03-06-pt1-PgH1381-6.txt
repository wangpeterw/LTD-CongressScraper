             THE UNHRC MUST STOP UNFAIRLY TARGETING ISRAEL

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Israel is America's 
treasured ally in the Middle East, and we must stand up for our friends 
when they are being treated unfairly. Recently, we have seen the United 
Nations targeting Israel with six anti-Israel resolutions passed in the 
last year alone. This is hypocritical discrimination.
  That is why I introduced House Resolution 728, which recognizes that 
the United Nations Human Rights Council wastes U.S. taxpayers' money by 
targeting Israel and reiterates that they

need to stop the shameful, prejudicial behavior toward Israel. Even 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has expressed disappointment with 
the Human Rights Council singling out Israel, given the multitude of 
other human rights violations occurring around the world.
  I was grateful for the opportunity to have attended the AIPAC Policy 
Conference this weekend, where I participated in a panel discussion on 
the threat to Israel from Gaza. There I highlighted the broad security 
concerns Israel is facing, such as the Hamas tunnels, and discussed 
ways in which the United States can assist to address the threats of 
kidnapping and murder, such as the murder of Taylor Force.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Americans appreciate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a world 
statesman, for his visit to Congress today.
