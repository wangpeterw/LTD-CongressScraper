             CONTINUE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS

  (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, for more than 50 years, community health 
centers across the United States have delivered affordable, accessible, 
and quality primary healthcare to patients regardless of their ability 
to pay. They care for the whole person, bringing together medical and 
behavioral health with pharmacy services.
  In my district, I have seen the important work that goes on at 
community health centers in Massachusetts, in Lowell, Lawrence, 
Gardner, and Fitchburg. In 2016, these facilities and their staff cared 
for more than 100,000 people.
  Unfortunately, community health centers are facing a funding cliff if 
the Community Health Center program is not reauthorized by the end of 
this year. A lack of funding means too many of my constituents would 
immediately lose access to care, putting the health of our communities 
at risk.
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together and 
make sure this vital program is funded.
