                              MEMORIAL DAY

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, America pauses to honor the 
patriotic men and women who sacrificed their lives in support of our 
liberty.
  For many, perhaps, Memorial Day has become just another reason for a 
cookout. But for more than 11,000 families in North Carolina, Memorial 
Day is very real. Their son or daughter or spouse or parent is among 
the 11,000 North Carolinians who died during World War II, Korea, 
Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan.
  Remembering the price of freedom makes me all the more grateful for 
the 17 students from my district who this year received appointments to 
West Point, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy. 
These students, many of them at or near the top of their class, are 
volunteering to dedicate at least 9 years to defend America. They know 
the potential risks and the ultimate sacrifice required by many.
  To the families of those who died in service to our Nation, we extend 
our deepest sympathy and gratitude. May God bless you.
