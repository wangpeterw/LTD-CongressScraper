                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, in my absence today, I would like to 
note my support for the confirmation of Mr. Kevin Hassett to be 
Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Due to 
ongoing and urgent recovery efforts from Hurricane Irma, which finished 
its course through Florida only yesterday, and the lack of commercial 
air travel in the wake of this disaster, I am staying in my State to 
help coordinate and marshal the full capacity of recovery resources 
available to us.
  Had I been able to attend today's vote, I would have voted in favor 
of Mr. Hassett's confirmation as Chairman.
  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered 
to be printed in the Record.)
