                   HONORING NAVY SEAMAN BOBBY TEMPLE

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor U.S. Navy Seaman Bobby 
Temple, a 19-year-old who died during the attack on Pearl Harbor in 
1941. He was one of 400 sailors who lost their lives aboard the USS 
Oklahoma and whose remains were buried in a mass grave.
  In 2015, the Navy started a project to identify each of the remains 
and bring closure to the families after 75 years. Bobby's bravery was 
honored during a memorial service in O'Fallon, Illinois, last week 
before his remains were laid to rest in the National Memorial Cemetery 
of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii.
  As a veteran myself, it is with heavy heart that I honor Bobby's 
heroic service and pray God's blessing for his peaceful rest.
