                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious God, thank You for giving us another day.
  We ask Your blessing of strength and perseverance that each Member 
might best serve their constituents and our entire Nation.
  The debates and issues that dominate the legislative landscape, as 
always, are contentious and challenging. Many Americans are anxious to 
know what will come to pass.
  Bless the Members of Congress with wisdom, equanimity, and good will 
as they struggle to find solutions that might unite rather than further 
divide our Nation. We know this is a lot to ask, but grant also to all 
Americans increased faith and hope, virtues most in need in these 
difficult days, that their Representatives might faithfully perform 
their appointed tasks.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
