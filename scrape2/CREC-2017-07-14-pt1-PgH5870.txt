                      IN TRIBUTE TO KAYE FISSINGER

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to Kaye Fissinger, a 
late resident of Colorado, who passed away at the age of 73.
  I only got to know Kaye during her time in Colorado the last 11 years 
of her life. I got to meet her through her work in founding Our Health, 
Our Future, Our Longmont that initiated a successful fracking ban for 
the city of Longmont and dealt with the disposal of fracking waste 
products in the city of Longmont.
  While, unfortunately, that fracking ban was later overturned by the 
Supreme Court, the legacy of her citizen activism should be inspiring 
for all of us. Her friend, Marisa Dirks, said: ``She was a fierce 
warrior for democracy and for our environment. . . . `'
  Our mutual friend, Bob Norris, said: ``Kaye was dedicated to many 
aspects of having a better and safer environment for all.''
  Kaye is somebody who, as a citizen, was able to pull people together 
and had more effect on keeping people safe than the politicians. Kaye 
truly helped give voice to the power of the people, and her legacy will 
live on with all those who were touched and protected by her actions.
