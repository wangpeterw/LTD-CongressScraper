                          Personal Explanation

  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, due to bad weather that did not allow for 
me to arrive in Washington, DC, in time, I was unavoidably detained. 
Had I been in attendance, I would have voted ``yes'' on:
  H.R. 423--Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017.
  H.R. 582--Kari's Law Act of 2017.
