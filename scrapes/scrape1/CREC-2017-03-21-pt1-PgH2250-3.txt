            WORKING TOGETHER ON THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will celebrate 7 years since 
the President signed the Affordable Care Act into law. The following 
day my colleagues across the aisle will vote to eradicate the 
undeniable progress it has made.
  On Thursday, when the House votes on the American Health Care Act, we 
will vote to take away health insurance from millions of Americans; we 
will vote to raise premiums on seniors; we will vote to damage women's 
healthcare programs; and we will vote to reduce access to care for 
LGBTQ people.
  Policies that were once derided as socialist are now mainstream, 
considering so many of the popular parts of ACA are retained in the 
Republican replacement.
  The majority of the country does not want to repeal ACA but to 
improve it in a bipartisan way. The only way to create a meaningful 
change for the American people is to work together across the aisle.
  As Lincoln said: ``We cannot escape history. We . . . will be 
remembered in spite of ourselves.'' A vote to repeal ACA will be a 
stain on that legacy.
