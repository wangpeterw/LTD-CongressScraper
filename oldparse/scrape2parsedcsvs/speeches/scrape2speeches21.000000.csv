There have been 16 U.Ambassadors to Tokyo, a very distinguished group since World War II: a five-star general, two former Senate majority leaders, a former Vice President of the United States, a former Speaker of the U.House of Representatives, the daughter of a former President of the United So far as I know, none of them were able to do what Bill Hagerty did in 2013 when he made a speech entirely in Japanese at the American Embassy in  That is just one reason I think Bill Hagerty is one of President Trump's best appointees.

From 2011 to 2015, he was the commissioner of economic and community development for In that role, working with Governor Haslam, he was enormously successful.

His wife, Chrissy, would want me to quickly add that there are two aspiring Girl Scouts in their family who will have time to do the same.  This is not only one of the best appointments but one of the most important of this There is a reason we have had such a distinguished list of Ambassadors since World War II, including our former majority leader, Senator Howard Baker from  Mike Mansfield, another former majority leader of this body, was also He used to say in every speech he made that the Japanese-American alliance is the most important two-country relationship in the world, bar none. Ambassador Mansfield said that so often that Americans in[[Page S3971]]Tokyo used to call our Embassy there the ``Bar None Ranch.''  If you will permit a little parochialism, Mr.Hagerty comes from a state, Tennessee, which has the most important relationship with Japan of any State, bar none.  That began about 40 years ago. I remember President Carter saying to me as a new Governor and to other Governors: ``Go to Persuade them to make in the United States what they sell in the United States.''  Off we all went. During my first 24 months as Governor, I spent 3 weeks in Japan and 8 weeks on Japanese-American relations. I explained to Tennesseans that I thought I could do more good for our State in Japan than I could in Washington, It turned out to be true. Nissan, Bridgestone, Komatsu, and other companies came, and so did the jobs.  By the mid-eighties, Tennessee had 10 percent of all the Japanese capital investment in the United States, and this has continued.

For too long, our veterans, Mr.Speaker, have been trapped in a system that has failed them. They are in a single-payer system. We put them in a system that the Members of Congress wouldn't sign up for. For years, we haven't give them the same choice that we have given Medicaid patients and Medicare patients.  The Choice Program isn't just common sense, it is common decency. We have asked these men and women to serve and to sacrifice for our freedom. They deserve the very best care. The only way they are going to get the best care is to have choice when they have geographic challenges or are waiting in line.  We have all read the reports about how our veterans have waited in line, have gotten sicker, and some even died. It is unconscionable and unacceptable.  I am so grateful that, in an institution that has a reputation of gridlock and dysfunction, we have a committee with leaders like Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz who will come together and put America first.

12584,topic-id,282,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.1970, the Kerrie Orozco This coming Saturday is the 2-year anniversary of the death of the Omaha Police Officer Kerrie Orozco, who was killed while serving a warrant to a convicted felon and known gang member. May 20, 2015, will forever be a somber day in the Omaha metro area.  Every day all across the country, first responders put their lives on the line to protect citizens. When Officer Orozco was killed, her husband, Hector, was going through the process to gain U.citizenship, and her death put a halt to it. He has an enormous responsibility as a single parent, and we owe it to Kerrie to ensure that her family is provided the same protections they would have had if this unfortunate situation had not occurred.  H.1970 would give many of our first responders peace of mind to know that, even in death, their surviving loved ones can continue the immigration process. This legislation would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow for the surviving family members of a fallen U.citizen first responder to be naturalized upon compliance with all requirements.  Current law allows for surviving family members of the U.military killed in service of our Nation to continue with their citizenship application. H.1970 will simply extend that privilege to first responders. We owe it to Officer Orozco and other fallen first responders to honor their memory by passing H.1970.  I look forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to give our first responders the peace of mind they deserve as they head out the door each day to serve our communities.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgH4342-2.txt,99999999999999,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1694, FANNIE AND FREDDIE OPEN",2017.0,18.0,April

12642,topic-id,471,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2480, the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act, a simple but powerful bill that will amend the Byrne JAG Grant Program to include funding initiatives aimed at disrupting and reducing the demand for sex trafficking.  As we know, dismantling the multifaceted web of sex trafficking requires collaborative and comprehensive action at every level of government. I am pleased to join Representative Hartzler and so many of my colleagues as we continue to address this problem.  In conjunction with a number of bills introduced this Congress to strengthen and reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, H.2480 acknowledges that a comprehensive approach to eliminate sex trafficking necessarily requires the inclusion of demand reduction efforts. Specifically, this bill provides support to State and local jurisdictions working to eliminate sex trafficking by expanding the designated use of Byrne JAG funding to include the express purpose of combating sex trafficking demand.  It is important that we support concrete and effective measures in furtherance of demand reduction as a critical component of law enforcement. Yet in nearly every State across the country, especially when it comes to underage youth, the buyers of sex tend to be treated as johns. When we are looking at underage girls, anybody that is purchasing sex should be viewed as a child molester.  Just as we are beginning to see the need to acknowledge the shift in how we see and respond to victims of sex trafficking--most of whom are minors, 59 percent of all reported cases in 2016 per Polaris National Hotline, and nearly all of them having involvement in the child welfare system, 86 percent as reported in the 2016 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children--there must be a paradigm shift in how we see and respond to those engaged in the illicit buying of women and children for sex.                              {time}  1545  Sex trafficking reduction programs under this bill would support enhanced efforts to arrest and prosecute these offenders. This bill would further help jurisdictions implement and facilitate necessary training programs designed to help law enforcement understand, identify, and appropriately respond fundamentally to those who buy and perpetrate sex trafficking.  Just as law enforcement must make critical efforts in distinguishing and identifying victims in need of services from petty criminals, so, too, must efforts be made to identify and prosecute dangerous and predatory sex offenders. Thus, State and local justice systems would be eligible to receive Byrne JAG money to support innovative advancements in developing and acquiring cutting-edge technology.  For example, H.2480 would support the use of programs like Spotlight, a web-based tool used by over 4,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.and Canada to enable them to collaborate across jurisdictions for streamlined tracking of child sex trafficking victims.

12526,topic-id,800,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Veasey for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, it is an honor for me to stand on this floor, but when I think that tonight I have to stand here and talk about the topic that the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to speak out against is a sad day.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my classmate and colleague and friend, Congressman Marc Veasey, for taking a leadership role and for making that clarion call to ask us to come.                              {time}  1945  Many of us will come tonight and speak out. Several of us will file our message so it can be recorded. Others will be back in their districts fighting for voting rights.  This is something we have to do because, unfortunately, it has been over 50 years since President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which has been the most powerful tool in defending the voting rights of minorities.  The Voting Rights Act, as you have heard tonight and you will continue to hear, outlawed the harassment, the intimidation, and the violence that many African Americans experienced when trying to exercise their right to vote.  It ended some of the most overtly discriminatory practices in our country's history by banning literacy tests, appointing Federal examiners in certain problematic areas to register voters and monitor elections, and criminalizing voter intimidation threats and coercion.  Also key to the Voting Rights Act, you have heard many of our attorneys explain it and talk about the creation of the preclearance process that required certain places with some of the worst histories of discrimination to gain approval from a Federal court or the Department of Justice before making election changes.  However, Mr.Speaker, during my first term in Congress, I became a part of this history. It was in 2013 that the United States Supreme Court struck down this crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County v. Holder decision, opening the door for States to reduce--I am going to say that again, Mr.Speaker--opening the door to reduce the electoral power of minority communities.  And with that door open, many States are taking this opportunity to pass a slew or a wave of laws, including strict voter ID requirements, early voting cutbacks, and registration restrictions, making it harder for many hardworking Americans to vote. That is just not right. Every citizen should have the right to vote.  Following the 2016 election, President Trump falsely claimed that millions voted illegally, perpetuating the myth of voter fraud long used to justify restrictive legislation that suppresses voters in low-income areas. I stand here today to tell you that it is not true.  And when the Congressional Black Caucus hears the President of these United States using terms like ``voter fraud'' or ``illegally voted,'' we can read between the lines, Mr.He is signaling his intent, in my opinion, to suppress the vote. He is signaling the support for efforts that will make it even harder for poor people, people of color, women, elderly people, to vote, one of the fundamental rights that we have to vote.  While the legislative maneuvers to restrict our citizens' fundamental right to vote should shock the conscience, it has not, and that is why we are standing on this floor today. That is why we are asking Democrats and Republicans to work together to correct this wrong.  We have witnessed the history of some 50-plus years of what happened to many people in some of our Southern Mr.Speaker, it is just not right, and that is why we are here today.  As former President Barack Obama said: ``This is something that has constantly been disproved.'' As a matter of fact, ``This is fake news.''  Now, one of my colleagues came to the floor tonight and said this is not a Democrat or a Republican issue. Well, let me say it a little differently. This should not be a Democrat or Republican issue; but if it were a bipartisan issue, we wouldn't be standing here in this Special Order hour demanding and asking that we come together, as Democrats and Republicans, and restore the voting rights.  So let me be very clear. The Congressional Black Caucus, through the leadership of our chairman, Congressman Cedric Richmond, through the leadership of our power-of-the-hour chair, Congressman Marc Veasey, and the other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of the largest minority caucuses in this House, we stand ready to advocate, we stand ready to protect those who we come here to protect.  So as elected officials, we have a responsibility to ensure the right of ``one person, one vote,'' and part of this responsibility includes making it easier, Mr.Speaker, not harder for citizens to vote.

12573,topic-id,1221,"Mr.Speaker, the day before yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration for two very important measures. First, the resolution provides for the consideration of H.2372, the VETERAN This rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Ways and Means  In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.2579, the Broader Options for Americans This rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Ways and Means  Mr.Speaker, both of these bills are a part of the House of Representatives' commitment to repair damage done by the Affordable Care These bills seek to amend key parts of the American Health Care Act, which the House passed on May 4 of 2017.  The American Health Care Act expands health coverage options for Americans by allowing them to use advanceable, refundable tax credits to purchase State-approved plans in the individual market. The two bills will ensure the tax credits that Americans will use to purchase health insurance policies will be available to all who qualify.  When the House passed the American Health Care Act, the bill included individual, advanceable, flexible, refundable tax credits that individuals can use to purchase health insurance policies on the individual market. When the bill passed, however, procedural reasons prevented the House from including two key groups of Americans: veterans who are eligible for coverage through the VA and individuals who need to get continuation of coverage through an employer's COBRA-sponsored plan. The two bills covered under this rule will remedy that same problem.  In recent years, the Internal Revenue Service has adopted a practice of providing eligible veterans the choice to get financial support for a private plan in lieu of enrolling in healthcare provided by the Department of Veterans  H.2372, the VETERAN Act, will codify this and continue that practice retroactively for both the Affordable Care Act's Premium Tax Credit and the new tax credit created in the American Health Care Veterans will continue to be able to get premium support when they opt out to purchase a private health plan instead of enrolling in the healthcare provided by the  Similarly, H.2579 will expand access to the new American Health Care Act tax credit to COBRA, in the continuation of that coverage. Under COBRA, group plans allow beneficiaries to keep their existing employer-sponsored coverage if they are laid off, work fewer hours, or lose insurance due to a change in family circumstances.  Often, those who need to use the COBRA coverage are those most in need, such as individuals who are in the middle of a treatment course and want to preserve their network of providers. COBRA coverage is frequently very expensive, since the individual policyholder must now pay all the premium for their policy.  H.2579 will extend the new tax credits to include people receiving COBRA coverage and enable people who need it to continue taking advantage of their employer-sponsored healthcare coverage, even after a triggering event.  Mr.Speaker, the bills the House will consider under this rule will help fulfill the promise Republicans made to the American people. We made repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with something that works the highest priority. Six weeks ago, we took the first step in fulfilling that promise with the passage of the American Health Care Act, and today we will take another step forward creating a healthcare system that works for all  Mr.Speaker, I urge support for the rule, I urge support for the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30 minutes; and I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to both the Speaker of the House and the minority leader for their presentations before the full House yesterday in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, which has wounded our colleague, Steve Scalise, and two Capitol Police officers, and two staffers.[[Page H4925]]  We were all horrified by what happened, but I thought both the Speaker and the minority leader came to the floor and set the right tone, not only for this Congress, but for the And Speaker Ryan, yesterday, I thought, truly was the Speaker of the entire House of Representatives because when he said that an attack against one of us is an attack against all of us, I think everyone feels that way.  I thought it was also important that both Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi reminded us that we are all part of one family. Sometimes we might be a little bit dysfunctional, but the bottom line is we are all part of one family. And like all families, we have our disagreements, we have our points of view, and we fight for what we believe in, and there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, that is what is right about this country.  But, clearly, our politics in this country have gotten coarse and, in many cases, ugly, and what happened yesterday is something that I think that all of us are deeply shocked by. And so we pray for our colleague, Steve Scalise, we pray for Matt Mika, Zachary Barth, and the two Capitol Police officers, David Bailey and Crystal We pray for their speedy recovery.  I, too, want to echo the sentiments that were stated yesterday by our leadership, both in the Republican and the Democratic Parties, that we honor our Capitol Hill police officers. I mean, they protect us each and every day. They put their lives on the line for us. And if they weren't there, the situation could have been much, much worse, and so I thank God that they were there.  As far as the rule goes, the gentleman from Texas knows how I feel about closed rules. I voice my opinion on that often, and I will continue to voice my opinion on that. But I don't think today is the time for me to prolong this debate, and I think we should move on, and that is what I intend to do.  Just one final thing, Mr.Speaker, on a personal note.

12645,topic-id,417,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding.  I rise today as an original cosponsor of H.2480, the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act, along with my friend and distinguished colleague from Missouri, Congresswoman Hartzler, and other colleagues.  This bipartisan act aims to provide local law enforcement with additional tools to fight the heinous epidemic of sex trafficking by expanding the authority of the vital Byrne Justice Assistance Grant act to enable law enforcement agencies to compete for Federal funding, specifically to develop and implement sex trafficking demand reduction programs.  Our legislation would also add an additional provision for Byrne JAG funding to allow State and local agencies more flexibility in prioritizing precious resources to combat domestic sex trafficking. The trafficking of mostly[[Page H5492]]young people for the purposes of sexual exploitation is a form of 21st century slavery that is pervasive around the world, around this country, and even in my home State of Missouri, as we heard earlier.  Sadly, because of my district's central location and easy access to cross-country interstates and modes of transportation, the Louis area is one of the top 20 markets for the horrific and inhuman crime. Most of the victims are minor children, and some of them have been kidnapped, beaten, and deceived by organized criminal enterprises who are exploiting their bodies for profit.  But the sick and the inhuman practice could not continue without steady demand, and reducing that market is exactly the purpose of this important bill.  According to a recent report by the National Human Trafficking Resource Center, this multibillion dollar slavery system victimizes over 20 million young people worldwide, with at least 1\1/2\ million of those victims in North Yet, last year in the United States, only about 5,000 cases were actually reported, leaving tens of thousands of other victims in the shadows with no protection, no help, and no hope.  As reported in the February 23, 2016 edition of The Atlantic magazine:       According to the United Nations' Office on Drugs and Crime,      sexual exploitation is the most commonly identified form of      forced labor worldwide. And as a whole, human trafficking is      a lucrative industry that, around the globe, rakes in at      least $150 billion.       But it is unclear whether the numbers are an accurate      representation of the problem, because many cases are not      reported, according to Monique Villa, the CEO of the Thomson      Reuters Foundation, which works to combat human trafficking.

12646,topic-id,98,"Mr.Speaker, the article continues on:       The problem with human trafficking is that, of course, the      victims are silenced. We don't have good data about it. You      don't know how many slaves there are around the world.       Traffickers also play into the narrative by telling victims      who are exploited for sex that they are offenders,      threatening to call the police and report them for      prostitution if they push back. This makes sex trafficking      particularly challenging because victims might be fearful of      going to law enforcement and being charged with a crime.

12514,topic-id,805,"Mr.Speaker, I would say to my friend who just spoke, if he wants to do something for Alzheimer's, don't pass the Senate Republican healthcare bill. It would devastate Medicaid and Alzheimer's victims who rely on Medicaid service.  Ensuring that every American has access to high-quality and affordable healthcare is the most important and enduring challenge, arguably, facing our Nation today. Ironically, we are closer than ever before to achieving that goal.  Since the Affordable Care Act was adopted, more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans have gained quality coverage. In fact, we have reduced the uninsured rate to the lowest level ever recorded. Americans no longer face punitive annual and lifetime limits, and they no longer have the fear of having their inadequate health insurance cut off if they dare get sick. Insurance companies can no longer refuse to cover Americans who suffer preexisting conditions, which is the case for tens of millions of  The Affordable Care Act has been the difference between life and death for adults who have been locked out of the system for years, for sick children who have reached their lifetime limits before they can even leave the hospital where they were born, for families bankrupted by a cancer diagnosis, and for everyday Americans that will require expensive treatments for the rest of their lives due to a chronic illness or accident.  The Republican effort to repeal this bill is a unilateral retreat from the progress made under the Affordable Care Act and from President Trump's own promise that there would be ``insurance for everybody.'' I guess there was a footnote: except for 23 million.  This promise made by the President is not the only falsehood perpetrated by many of my friends on the other side of the aisle about the Affordable Care Here are three more:  Falsehood number one: Republicans say costs are out of control.  The truth is, since the Affordable Care Act became law, healthcare costs have grown at the slowest rate in 50 years. That is right, the slowest rate in 50 years, and considerably below the decade preceding the adoption of the act. Republicans conveniently ignore the fact that, under their own repeal plan, their premiums would go up an average of 64 percent.  Falsehood number two: Republicans claim the Affordable Care Act is in a death spiral.  Well, this would come as news to the Congressional Budget Office, Standard & Poor's, and the American Academy of Actuaries, all of whom have concluded that the Affordable Care Act's individual markets are stable and could continue to improve, except, of course, for Republicans talking it down.  Falsehood number three: Republicans say that insurers are fleeing the markets and consumers will have no choice.  The truth is the Affordable Care Act is not imploding, but Republicans have certainly tried to sow dysfunction and destroy the individual markets. In some places, they have succeeded. They have resorted to sabotaging the individual markets to fulfill their own false narrative. They killed the risk corridors that stabilized those markets and have used riders and must-pass spending bills to undermine premium stabilization programs.  This has resulted in huge losses to some insurers, causing them to pull out of markets, understandably, and to increase premiums when they otherwise would not have. Ironically, the same premium stabilization programs that the Republicans have attacked since 2014 are actually in their own repeal bill.  The Trump administration has refused to commit to making the cost-sharing reduction payments that lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers. That has caused premiums to go up. Without those payments, Americans will see premiums increase by an average of 19 percent.                              {time}  1030  One Blue Cross Blue Shield executive noted the premium increases would be 8 percent if the cost-sharing reduction payments were guaranteed.  Other insurers have explicitly stated that their participation is contingent on those payments. Threatening not to make those payments, of course, undermines the system.  Those payments are not the only aspect of ObamaCare the Trump administration has sabotaged. They have also disrupted enrollment in individual markets by refusing to enforce the individual mandate, by cutting the open enrollment period in half, and by refusing to promote the enrollment itself on television.  Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration have chosen sabotage and repeal over bipartisan cooperation to fix that which is not working. I would propose we work in a bipartisan fashion, and I have three ideas.  First, introduce a public option to increase competition in marketplaces; second, we can implement premium stabilization programs in order to keep premiums affordable for everybody; and third, we can increase premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies to lower costs and boost enrollment for middle class That is the bipartisan solution to healthcare, not a reckless repeal effort that will deny 23 million of our fellow Americans access to healthcare.[[Page H5767]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgH5766.txt,1959,DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS BONUS TRANSPARENCY ACT,2017.0,13.0,July

The      total estimated cost is $1.46 billion.       This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and      national security of the United States by strengthening the      security of a Major Non-NATO ally which has been, and      continues to be, an important force for political stability      within the region. New Zealand is a close ally in the region      and an important partner on critical foreign policy and      defense issues.[[Page S2607]]       The Government of New Zealand intends to use these defense      articles and services to continue its Maritime Surveillance      Aircraft (MSA) capability, following retirement of its P-3K      maritime patrol aircraft. The sale will strengthen collective      defense and enhance New Zealand's regional and global allied      contributions.       New Zealand has procured and operated U.produced P-3 MSA      for over 40 years, providing critical capabilities to NATO      and coalition maritime operations.

12446,topic-id,1253,"Mr.President, as I speak, wildfires are blazing across In fact, as of this moment, we have 21 active fires, with just about 300,000 acres burned, which has turned our big sky into gray smoke. In fact, the Lodgepole fire in Eastern Montana alone has burned over 250,000 acres, and there are 300-plus heroes bravely working to tame those growing flames.  I was on the phone a couple of times with our county commissioner from Garfield County, and we talked about how to get more resources for these devastating fires. I just got word an hour ago that the Sunrise fire on the western side of our State, near Superior, MT, was just elevated in the last couple of hours as the 2 national priority fire in the  Montana is hot, Montana is dry, and there is a long way to go yet in this fire season. The status quo is simply unacceptable. With these fires blazing and the ground cracking beneath us, we are reminded of how fragile the way of life in Montana is.  Our 1 economic driver in Montana is agriculture. Montana ag supports our economy in seasons of plenty, as well as in seasons of drought, including physical drought and unseasonable rains. We have seen both in Montana, and farmers and ranchers have risen to the occasion each time. As they have supported us, we must support them.  The historic drought conditions in Eastern Montana warrant relief from regulations that limit the producers' abilities to use our land in the best ways possible. I was pleased by the decision of Secretary Perdue and the USDA to allow impacted producers to best use the Conservation Reserve Program acreage for grazing, but I believe Montana producers are not able to sleep at night for fear of losing their family farms. They deserve more support from those who benefit from their legacy of hard work.  I have held and will continue to hold USDA's feet to the fire, urging additional emergency relief for farmers and[[Page S4131]]ranchers. I have been engaging with Montana farmers and ranchers. Most recently, I spoke with officials; I was literally on the phone last night with officials from Garfield County, talking with folks on the ground as to what the lack of rain has meant for them.  I understand the severity of drought and the risk of wildfires. Let me tell you, wildfires are all too common for those of us who live in Hundreds of fires burn through Montana's forests every year, with countless firefighters fighting to protect lives and property. Year after year, I will come down here, and you will hear me speak on the floor; you will hear me in committees; you will hear me back home, talking about the fact that these fires are ready to ignite at any moment. You can see the unmanaged forests we have in Montana are literally just waiting for a massive wildfire. With nearly 300,000 acres burned--and we aren't even in August yet; it is still July--it is a big deal for a State known for its wide open landscapes.  We need forest management reform urgently. It is a topic always on the forefront of my mind and on the forefront of Montanans and those of us out West, but it is on the back burner of the swamp here in Washington, DC, until, of course, we get to fire season; then we will talk about it.  We must reform the way we manage our national forests. We can use proven tactics to reduce the threat of wildfires, as well as to reduce the rate of spread and intensity of those fires when they occur. We need a wildfire funding fix because we can't just keep hoping the Congress will pay back the Forest Service at the end of every season. It is not the way a family budgets, and the Forest Service shouldn't have to either.  We have nearly 5 million acres of national forest in Montana that have been identified as critically in need of restoration. We are talking about dying and dead timber, primarily because of beetle kill, and we can't even get in and manage the timber because we have these far-left groups that would challenge many of our timber sales in court. I have joined Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in sponsoring legislation to encourage partnerships between the Forest Service and the State foresters to carry out these cross-boundary restoration projects.  A fire does not respect boundaries; it doesn't know where the State land ends or Federal land begins or where private land is or reservation lands are. We need to work better as neighbors along the fence line to reduce fuels and wildfire hazards across the country. These partnerships and projects will make fighting these wildfires safer for firefighters and allow them to return home safely to their families.  At this time of year, we recognize our firefighters, in particular, as some of the bravest men and women out there. The courage with which they run toward danger--I tell you, if you have never seen a wildfire burning out west, it is an incredibly terrifying sight to see huge plumes of flames that reach up to 30,000 feet in the atmosphere. They are ominous. These brave men and women run toward danger to protect our lives and our homes.                        Honoring Trenton Johnson  Mr.President, let me close by recognizing a young man who lost his life in Montana just this past week. His name was Trenton Trenton Johnson was such a man--one of those brave heroes.

12562,topic-id,1796,"Mr.President, on a separate note, it has been more than 5 months since the intelligence agencies in the United States reached a solid consensus on a critical issue. The agencies presented to the American people 5 months ago their damning assessment that Russia actively tried to interfere in our last Presidential election to help elect someone they thought would be a better friend to the Russian interests.  I think it is important to recall some of the key findings by our own intelligence agencies on a virtually unanimous basis. They said:       Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.presidential      election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's      longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal      democratic order, but these activities demonstrate a      significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and      scope of effort compared to previous operations.[[Page S3101]]       We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential      election.  Our intelligence agencies went on to say:       Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.     democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her      electability and potential presidency. We further assess that      Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference      for President-elect       Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered      campaign aimed at the U.presidential election to future      influence efforts worldwide, including against U.allies      and their election processes.  We have never seen anything like this in our history--nothing. What Vladimir Putin did--or tried to do--is staggering, momentous, and something we should not ignore. A foreign adversary intentionally manipulating America's democracy and election to try to get a result friendly to Russia but not consistent with American public opinion--that was his goal.  The dictionary defines an act of war as ``an act of aggression by a country against another with which it is nominally at peace.''  Was the Russia attack on our election an act of war? Is sure seems close to the definition. At a minimum, it was an act of cyber war against America and an attack on our democracy. It should not go unanswered. Troublingly, there have been few answers forthcoming from this President and this  What did the White House and the majority party in Congress do to respond to this act of cyber war to protect against any future attacks? Virtually nothing. As more and more questions have emerged about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and these Russian actions against our election, possible Russian money, and the President's business interests, and troubling ties between those close to Trump and the Russians, this President has instead been trying to endear himself to the Russians, incredibly.  That is right. On May 10, he had a closed meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador in which the President reportedly boasted about sensitive intelligence and--this is truly incredible--also boasted about firing our Nation's FBI Director to relieve the ``great pressure'' on him over the Russia investigation.  In fact, he reportedly told the Russians:       I just fired the head of the He was crazy, a real nut      job . . . I faced great pressure because of That's      taken off . . . I'm not under investigation.  That is the end of the attributed quote to the President of the United  Let that sink in for a moment. The President of the United States was bragging to the same people who attacked our election and democracy that he had fired the top law enforcement officer investigating that attack. That is incredible, both for its obvious appearance of obstruction of justice but also for what should have so obviously been said in that meeting instead.  President Trump, instead of a frivolous exchange with a dictatorial regime that attacked our Nation, should have had as his first message to the Russians the obvious: Do not ever interfere in our elections or those of our allies again or you will face serious consequences--end of meeting.  Then the President should have come out and related this conversation to the American press and to the American people.  Instead, the President let the Russians bring their own official photographer from the TASS Soviet news agency into the Oval Office and--get this--excluded all of the American press--just the friendly Russian cameras. Then, the Russians gleefully sent out victory tweets of the President's warm and friendly greeting.  This is totally upside down. Yet it only gets worse. Stunningly, it was just revealed Monday night that President Trump asked two of the Nation's top intelligence officials in March to help him push back against the FBI investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and the Russian  The Washington Post reported that President Trump made separate appeals to the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, and the Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Mike Coats and Rogers both rightly refused to comply with President Trump's request, properly deemed as an inappropriate request from the President of the United States to leaders of our intelligence-gathering community. I applaud the respect of these two men for our democratic norms and system of government and the rejection of the President's reckless, selfish request.  This is breathtaking--an American President running from the Russians to our Nation's top law enforcement agency to our intelligence community, bizarrely pleading innocence on a matter of grave national security and trying to undermine ongoing investigations.  Former CIA General Counsel Jeffrey Smith said Trump's deeply troubling effort is an echo of President Nixon's ``unsuccessful effort to use the CIA to shut down the FBI's investigation of the Watergate break-in on national security grounds'' and, in his words, these actions were ``an appalling abuse of power.''  I had argued that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should either appoint a special counsel to look at the allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians or tender his resignation. I said this after he was set up by the Trump administration to write a memo explaining the firing of James Comey as Director of the FBI and giving as his reason to protect the honor and integrity of Hillary Clinton during the campaign.  That was a laughable assertion.  Rosenstein wrote it. For at least 24 hours, that was the official line from the Trump White Then, there was the Lester Holt interview on NBC, and the President came out and said: I wanted to get rid of him months ago; I wanted to put an end to this Russian thing.  I am pleased that Mr.Rosenstein made the right decision when he appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to fill the special counsel role.  Back in the year 2001, that ominous year of 9/11, I first met Robert He was the Director of the We worked together on some important issues relative to the I came to respect him very much. He is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war, where he served as an officer in the Marine Corps, a former Federal judge, a man of the opposite political faith, but a man who clearly loves his country above party, whenever he is asked. He is a man who has not only risen to the challenge of public service but who has excelled to the point where his term as Director of the FBI was extended--a rarity around Washington and, certainly, on a bipartisan basis almost unthinkable these days. But it happened with Robert It happened because he is smart, he is principled, and he loves his country, and we know it. I don't think Rod Rosenstein could have chosen a better person.  I don't know if I will ultimately agree with his investigation of this critical issue, but I will respect his findings, whatever they may be, because I know that they are heartfelt, sincere, and principled.  While this special counsel investigation will be critical, it is not a substitute, however, for continued congressional action, as well, as some have suggested or perhaps hoped. I know the Senate Intelligence Committee is actively pursuing this matter, and I salute them for that effort, but I think we need to think about more. We need to think about an independent commission--a bipartisan, transparent commission--to deal with policy questions. For instance, what are we going to face from the Russians in the next election? What did we learn in the last election to protect ourselves?  The special counsel is going to focus on whether crimes were committed, but I am deeply concerned that there may be matters related to Russia's attack that may not involve crimes themselves but should be made public to the American people. It is Congress's responsibility, just as it was after the September 11 tragedy, to make sure the American people know as much as possible in a democracy. That is how it works.  Former Watergate investigator Scott Armstrong made this point in an op-ed in Sunday's New York He pointed out how a select congressional committee and a special prosecutor overcame partisan and jurisdictional conflicts to get to the truth during He noted:[[Page S3102]]         A mature special prosecutor and a well-led congressional      inquiry can coordinate over issues like witness immunity.      Congress can creatively expand its witness list beyond      prosecution targets and fill in critical details from      satellite witnesses . . . If the committee is aggressive and      truly bipartisan, it can not only educate and reassure the      public, but also legislate solutions to prevent future      abuses.  There are a lot of parallels between the Watergate era and what we face today, but, sadly, one major difference from the Nixon era to the Trump era is the willingness of members of the President's own party to stand up and speak out.  Back in Nixon's day, there came a moment when a handful of Senators from this Chamber changed history, and one of them was Barry He met with President Nixon and he said: There are only so many lies you can take, and now there has been one too many.  Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania joined him, as well as another Republican--John Rhodes, a Republican leader in the They made it clear to President Nixon that what he had done was unacceptable by any standard and they would no longer stand by him. It took courage for them to do that. The President saw the writing on the wall, and he resigned.  We are looking for similar leadership today from both sides of the aisle--not just Democrats but Republicans as well--to stand up and defend our democracy from Putin's interference.  There have been months of relative inaction. It is clear that the President is not going to stand up to It is time for all of us--Democrats and Republicans in Congress--to act for the good of this Nation and get to the truth of what happened and make sure Russia can never do this to our democracy again.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgS3100-5.txt,326,TRIBUTE TO ZANE HEHNKE,2017.0,23.0,June

12580,topic-id,2377,"Mr.President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for April 2017. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, S.Con.3. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act,  My last filing can be found in the Record on March 1, 2017. The information contained in this report captures legislative activity since that filing through April 25, 2017.  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared Tables 1-3 of this report.  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the For this reporting period, 14 of the 16 authorizing committees are in compliance with their allocations. The two committees out of compliance are: the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, for spending $1 million more in budget authority and outlays than allowed over each enforcement window due to passage of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017, P.115-10; and the Committee on Veterans Affairs, which violates its outlay allocation by $200 million over both the fiscal year 2017-2021 and fiscal year 2017-2026 periods. The latter violation--the largest of this reporting period--stems from passage of a bill to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to modify the termination date for the Veterans Choice Program, and for other purposes, P.115-26. This measure removed the August 7, 2017, sunset from the program to allow funds previously appropriated to be fully exhausted.  Tables 2-3 remain unchanged from the last report as no new appropriations activity has occurred for the fiscal year 2017 cycle.  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget totals approved by the  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA section 311. In its report, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the latest continuing resolution, which provides funding through April 28, 2017. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views current-law levels as being $953 billion and $583.2 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively.  Revenues are consistent with the levels assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017. Over the fiscal year 2017-2021 and fiscal year 2017-2026 period, however, revenues are $1 million below assumed levels due to the enactment of H.83, P.115-21, a resolution considered under the Congressional Review Act for disapproving of the rule by the Department of Labor relating to ``Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness.''  Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in S.Con.3.  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently shows increased deficits of $202 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 and fiscal year 2016-2026 periods. For both of these periods, outlays have been increased by $201 million, and revenues have been reduced by $1 million. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 201 of Con.Res.21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.

Mike Enzi,     Chairman, Committee on the Budget     U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of      Congressional action on the fiscal year 2017 budget and is      current through April 25, 2017. This report is submitted      under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the      Congressional Budget Act, as amended.       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues      are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of      3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for      Fiscal Year 2017.       Since our last letter dated March 1, 2017, the Congress has      cleared and the President has signed the National Aeronautics      and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2017 (Public      Law 115-10). That act has significant effects on budget      authority and outlays in fiscal year 2017.           Sincerely,                                                       Keith Hall,                                                                 TABLE 1.--SENATE CURRENT LEVEL REPORT FOR SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR                 FISCAL YEAR 2017, AS OF APRIL 25, 2017                        [In billions of dollars]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               Current                                      Budget      Current    Level  Over/                                    Resolution    Level b     Under (-)                                        a                     Resolution------------------------------------------------------------------------On-Budget    Budget Authority.............      3,226.1      3,308.0         81.9    Outlays......................      3,224.6      3,254.7         30.1    Revenues.....................      2,682.1      2,682.1          0.0Off-Budget    Social Security Outlays c....        805.4        805.4          0.0    Social Security Revenues.....        826.0        826.0          0.0------------------------------------------------------------------------Source: Congressional Budget Office.a Excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in  outlays assumed in 3 for non-regular discretionary  spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to  discretionary spending limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, that is not  yet allocated to the Senate Committee on Appropriations.b Excludes emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency  requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget  and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.c Excludes administrative expenses paid from the Federal Old-Age and  Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance  Trust Fund of the Social Security Administration, which are off-  budget, but are appropriated annually.

These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:                                       Budget                                    Authority     Outlays      Revenues Further Continuing and Security             -2           -1            0 Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.114-254)............. \c\ Division A of P.114-254 contains the Further Continuing  Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding for those agencies  within the jurisdiction of 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills  through April 28, 2017; those amounts are shown under the ``Continuing  Resolution'' section of this table. Certain provisions in Division A  provide funding until or beyond the end of fiscal year 2017; those  amounts are shown in the ``Previously Enacted'' section of this table.  In addition, Division B of P.114-254 contains the Security  Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding until or  beyond the end of fiscal year 2017 for overseas contingency  operations; those amounts are shown under the ``Previously Enacted''  section of this table.\d\ Sections 193-195 of Division A of P.114-254 provided funding,  available until expended, for innovation projects and state responses  to opioid abuse. CBO estimates that, for fiscal year 2017:The $20 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section  193 would result in an additional $5 million in outlays for FDA  innovation projects;The $352 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section  194 would result in an additional $91 million in outlays for NIH  innovation projects;The $500 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section  195 would result in an additional $160 million in outlays for state  response to opioid abuse.Consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.114-255, for the purposes of  estimating the discretionary budget authority and outlays for these  provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974  and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Act of 1985, these  amounts are estimated to provide no budget authority or outlays.\e\ For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget  Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not  include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.  As a result, current level does not include these items.\f\ Excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in  outlays assumed in 3 for non regular discretionary  spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to  discretionary spending limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, that is not  yet allocated to the Senate Committee on  TABLE 3.--SUMMARY OF THE SENATE PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORECARD FOR THE 115TH                     CONGRESS, AS OF APRIL 25, 2017                        [In millions of dollars]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 2016-2021    2016-2026------------------------------------------------------------------------Beginning Balance a...........................            0            0Enacted Legislation: b,c,d    Tested Ability to Leverage Exceptional                *            *     National Talent Act of 2017 (P.115-1).

12613,topic-id,1071,"Mr.President, I greatly appreciate having this opportunity to share with my colleagues the presentation of an award that means a great deal to me for a number of reasons. It is the president's medal that will be presented by Steven Knapp, the president of The George Washington University, Its recipient, Edward Gnehm, has been a friend of mine ever since we were college freshmen at  When Edward Gnehm, Jr., or ``Skip'' as everyone came to know him, came to Washington, DC, from rural Georgia and I left rural Wyoming to tackle the challenge of my own college education at GW, I don't think either one of us knew what a great impact those 4 years would have on us and how our college experience would change our lives forever. It was a purely random thing, but when the administration of George Washington University decided which rooms we would use as freshman, they assigned Skip and me to the same dorm. We became friends pretty quickly. Then, when we pledged the same fraternity, we became brothers as well. Skip is the only real brother I have ever had, and I have relied on him and enjoyed that same kind of friendship and relationship ever since.  Our room was a pretty interesting place to be. I was a night person, studying accounting and business issues that would become my first major career. Skip, on the other hand, was a morning person, interested in reading whatever he could to sharpen his knowledge and understanding of foreign relations. He had a dream even back then that he would someday be an ambassador for the United  As I watched him pursue his dream, I learned that Skip was an interesting guy, very smart, dedicated, and determined to be the best he could possibly be at his chosen field. He helped me learn to expect the same of myself.  Soon, our college years were over, and we each went our separate ways, keeping in contact, pursuing our life's dreams and taking advantage of every opportunity that presented itself. Soon Skip was making his way through our Nation's diplomatic and foreign service system. For my part, what began as a small business soon had me working my way through Wyoming's political system on the local, State, and national levels.  As the years went quickly past, Skip and I continued to follow a similar path in life as we both met and married our special wives. Our kids were even born about the same times. Skip found in his wife, Peggy, and I found in my wife, Diana/, the kind of support and assistance it was going to take if we were to achieve the kind of success we were both hoping for. For Skip, Peggy's encouragement and guidance has helped him to be a force for the United States and to serve our country all over the world. For my part, Diana has been exactly what I needed to serve the people of Wyoming at every opportunity.  For Skip, one of the greatest moments of his career had to be his service as our Ambassador to He was nominated to that post when Saddam Hussein came calling with his army and attempted to set up shop there. Fortunately, Skip had what it takes to face up to a challenge like that with great courage, bravery, and determination. Those who knew him weren't surprised. We knew he had it in him, and when our Nation emerged from that challenge, our President,[[Page S2719]]George Bush, knew he had chosen wisely when he selected Skip Gnehm for that difficult post. I got to watch on television as Skip raised the American flag at the recaptured U.Embassy in  I could go on at length about some of his other posts and the places he has served to promote and protect U.interests. He has been our Deputy Permanent Representative to the United He has also served as our Ambassador to Australia and to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, presenting his credentials on 9/11 and then flying to peace meetings with the King of He still has special contacts throughout the Middle  Over the years, Skip received a number of awards for his work overseas, including the Secretary of State's Distinguished Service Award for his service in Jordan and Superior Honor Awards for his service in Kuwait and  Skip has also been an active force for the betterment of The George Washington University in a number of different capacities. He has been a member of the board of trustees, the vice president of the general alumni association, and the faculty representative to the board of directors.  Skip is currently on the faculty of the Elliott School of International Affairs where he is inspiring our next generation of foreign policy advisers and experts by sharing his own experience borne from a lengthy career in our foreign service. Thanks to Skip, we can rest assured that our future diplomatic efforts will be in good hands  Looking back to those days years ago when Skip and I were spending another night hitting the books for the next day's class or exam, I don't think either one of us could have dreamed how well things would turn out for the two of us. I have been given an opportunity to represent the people of Wyoming as mayor, member of the State legislature, and now as a U.I was always proud to work on Skip's confirmation to these different postings. Skip has had an impact all over the world and touched more lives than we will ever be able to count.  Simply put, I couldn't be more proud of Skip and all he has accomplished over the years. I don't think anyone is more deserving of the president's medal that he will receive from The George Washington University's president Steven Steven is doing great work to promote GW and ensure its future will be even better than its past.  This is a great honor for Skip, and I am sure he couldn't be more appreciative of this recognition. It represents a lifetime of achievements for him and an amazing list of accomplishments. As the title of the classic film reminds us, Skip has had a ``wonderful life'' of which both Skip and GW can be truly proud. He represents what a tremendous advantage an education at George Washington University can be when placed in the right hands.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2718-3.txt,1542,VIOLENCE IS NEVER THE ANSWER,2017.0,3.0,July

12589,topic-id,1425,"Mr.Speaker, this is Infrastructure  Can you imagine Congress actually talking about building things that America needs, like roads, high-speed internet, and maybe a few ports and ships and high-speed trains from here to there?  It is Infrastructure Mr.President, you promised us a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill; however, you seem to be occupied on a few other things. So we will be understanding and just kind of take up the issue here and talk about it and see if we can move this issue forward since we really haven't heard from the administration on your trillion-dollar program.  Let's talk about some of the elements of it today. I am going to start with a really old placard that we have used now for 7 years. We call this the Make It In America agenda, and it has been something that Mr.Hoyer of Maryland and I and many others on the Democratic side of the aisle have been talking about for some time. We talk about trade; tax policy; energy policy; and labor issues, such as the Davis-Bacon Act that guarantees that we are not going to have a rush to the bottom, but that we are going to hold up the working men and women that are making things in America, like roads and bridges; education; research; and not at the bottom, but always important, infrastructure.  So today we talk about infrastructure. As we do so, I want us to always keep in mind that infrastructure offers an incredible opportunity for America to do more than just lay down concrete, more than just putting asphalt on a road or a pipe in the ground. Infrastructure offers an opportunity for us to rebuild the American manufacturing sector. There are many different ways we can do that.  For example, if we are going to build locomotives for the eastern corridor of the Amtrak system here in the United States, new electric locomotives. Way back when, some of us do remember the Great Recession and the effort of this Congress--then controlled by the Democrats--to jump-start, to rebuild the American economy. In what was the stimulus legislation there was a piece of it that called for, I think, $700 million or $800 million for about 80 new electric locomotives for Some brilliant staffer wrote into it: 100 percent American made.  Guess what. Siemens, a German company, said, Oh, a $700 million, $800 million contract to make a bunch of locomotives; we can do that. So, in Sacramento, California, they expanded their little trolly plant and made it into a locomotive plant. They have now built all of those 100 percent American made.  So when we talk about infrastructure--in this case, the Amtrak system--it can be made in Manufacturing matters.  To get down to the details here of what infrastructure is all about, international trade is critical to the American economy. Unfortunately, we are running a trade deficit. All of that trade--about 90 percent of it, actually--comes through the ports of So when you talk about infrastructure, you have got to talk about the ports.  Harbor maintenance is a particular program that has been in existence for a long time. It is a tax on every cargo container that arrives in the United States in ports and is basically used for dredging.  My colleague and I, who will joining me in a few moments from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, made a little change here. We said that money can't just go for the support of the Treasury and the deficit, but, rather, it must be used on harbor maintenance. We expanded the definition of harbor maintenance to include on the wharf and related issues.  But when we talk about infrastructure, much of that infrastructure will start at the great ports on the West Coast up in Seattle and the Puget Sound and San Francisco Don't let me forget about They have got some great ports in Then, of course, the busiest port in America--well, probably among the busiest ports--L.A.-Long Beach Port in  Are the American ports ready for tomorrow's international commerce?  The answer is: Not really.  The Panama Canal has been expanded and now we have ships called Panamax ships and super Panamax ships, all of which require that our ports be upgraded. The channel has deepened. The wharf has expanded. The number of containers that can be handled at any one time increased.  So you have got the channel deepening, wharves that need to be made, docks, the rest, and all of the cranes and all of the movement necessary to[[Page H4218]]handle these ships that have thousands upon thousands of containers, all of which have to be unloaded quickly.  I want to begin with the infrastructure issue at the ports, but there is more to it than that. It is the ships that arrive at the ports.  The United States used to have a great maritime industry. At the end of World War II, there were more than 1,500 American-flagged and American-built ships. Over the years, we have seen a continuing decline in that. We had 500 about 20 years ago, and today, less than 80 ships are American-flagged.  We do have the Jones Act, which is extremely important. That is for the domestic shipping. Those are American-flagged and American-built ships, but those are all domestic. The intercontinental ships--what they call the Blue Ocean Ships--are not made in America anymore, but they could be.  This is where I want to take this discussion. I want to take this discussion back to another part of the infrastructure. Remember, I was talking to you about the trains, the locomotives made in America and really rebuilding the American locomotive industry in California with a German company, Siemens, building those locomotives.  Now, guess what. America is not energy independent yet, but we are on our way to that. We would expect to be the third largest exporter of natural gas in the form of liquefied natural gas by 2020 and one of the world's largest exporters of crude oil by 2025. As of today, none, nada, not any of that liquefied natural gas or oil will be on American-built ships.  Don't you think it ought to be the American policy that some of it should be on American-built ships with American flags and American mariners?  If you care about the national security, you should care about blue water shipbuilding in the United There are two bills that I am introducing that go directly to this.  The fundamental question is this: Will the LNG ships be made in China, Korea, Japan, or will they be made in America?  American national security depends upon the U.Navy and the ability to build ships in the United  Right now, the great oceangoing ships on the commercial side are not built in the United States and our shipyards are losing the trained men and women, from naval architects to welders and steamfitters, and on and on, that can build these ships.  What we need to do is to reenergize the American shipbuilding industry and the infrastructure that goes with it by passing legislation that we call the Energizing American Maritime Act and energizing the American shipbuilding industry, all part of an infrastructure package that includes the ports, the docks, the trains and trucks that arrive there, multimedia, and on the water itself--American-built ships with American sailors providing at least some of the export potential that is in the process of being achieved.  Liquefied natural gas. We would expect to have more than 100 ships moving that LNG from American ports to somewhere around the world--mostly China, Japan, India, and                              {time}  1945  But right now it will be zero unless we pass a bill--16 lines of law--that say: Build it in America; make it in America, American mariners, American ships.  We can do this as part of a large, trillion-dollar infrastructure package--ships on the ocean and ports in America that are capable of handling the largest ships in the world, docks that are capable of quickly unloading these ships in an efficient, effective manner, rail yards that move the goods out of the ports and into the ports for export, and the trucks that move across the highways, all of this, part of an infrastructure package, just one piece of a much larger issue.

It specifies that the JAG funds may be used for demand reduction operations.  Mr.Speaker, there is no question that the fight against human trafficking starts at the local level. It infects every community, and our local officials and law enforcement are on the front lines in this battle. They are in the best position to assess how to address this issue in their communities and how to use these taxpayer dollars.  As part of any comprehensive approach in combating trafficking, local government and law enforcement must address what many call the demand issue; that is, going after those who are buying young victims off the street and, very often, off the internet. This is simple economics applied to a horrific crime.  Human trafficking is driven by the demand for commercial sex, and this is costing victims their sense of worth and their dignity. By deterring demand, traffickers will have fewer buyers and may abandon their illegal and horrifyingly reprehensible activity.  These demand reduction operations and programs are most often carried out at the local level, and it is important to ensure local governments have the tools they need to prevent this destructive crime by deterring people from buying victims.                              {time}  1530  We cannot tolerate sex trafficking and must be able to act swiftly to combat this horrific crime.

He earned several decorations in the line of duty, earning the Good Conduct Medal, American Defense Service Ribbon, two Bronze Stars, and others.  After John's discharge from duty, he returned home to Davenport, IA, where he still lives. John and his late wife, Velma, raised two boys.  Our country can't thank Mr.Massick enough for his service. We will never truly be able to repay the debt owed to those who put their lives on the line in defense of freedom, not just for Americans but for those around the world. While I may not ever be able to thank Mr.Massick enough for his service, I do hope that shedding light on his incredible service may serve as a symbol of this body's gratitude.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-24-pt1-PgS2487.txt,457,CITIZENSHIP FOR SURVIVORS OF FALLEN FIRST RESPONDERS,2017.0,24.0,May

12683,topic-id,642,"Mr.President, I wish to address the issue of the healthcare debate that has been going on since the first of the year. Now that it has passed the House of Representatives, it comes to the The Senate is working on its own bill, not working from the House bill. This is still evolving, and I hope it will evolve very, very quickly.[[Page S3180]]  One of the things we face is to make sure we have accessible, affordable care for anyone who wants to buy health insurance.  I rise today, as I have in the past, to share real stories from real Iowans who have been harmed--not helped--by the Affordable Care I know there are plenty of examples we can give of people who have not benefited from the Affordable Care As we have found so many times, the Affordable Care Act has become the un-Affordable Care The other side often talks about the benefits of ACA without mentioning the reality I am trying to bring to this debate.  There is a reason Republicans are acting to protect Americans from the loss of access to medical care. ObamaCare has broken its promises. All these promises, made over and over again, have not stood the test of time, so I would like to remind everyone of some of these promises.  The promise: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  The reality: This promise was even scrubbed from the ObamaCare website after everyone knew it was a farce.  The promise: You will be able to keep your insurance plan.  What is the reality? In the fall of 2013, between 7 and 12 million people had health insurance cancelled. ObamaCare's mandates resulted in fewer choices for people to buy affordable insurance. People were kicked off plans they liked and plans that, until ObamaCare, they could afford. This promise was dubbed the ``Lie of the Year.''  Another promise was made: Your premiums will go down by $2,500.  That is not even close. I have been quoting for a long period of time that they had gone up at least $3,500. Now, more recently, I have seen a figure of an average of $4,300. So, in reality, that $2,500 promise that premiums would go down wasn't even close.  In Iowa, premiums increased up to 43 percent in just 1 year. One farmer told me that his insurance went up from $20,000 to $32,000 in 1 year. He was able to get the premium down to $25,000 by taking advantage of an HMO, but the deductible for that plan was $15,000. You have an insurance policy, but you may never use it.  The biggest promise: You were promised access to affordable health care. The law is called the Affordable Care That is the most concerning of all--the situation created by ObamaCare is far from affordable.  What is the reality? Premiums in 2017 have doubled for a majority of States using ObamaCare exchanges. In three States, premiums have tripled during One Iowan from Pomeroy, IA, wrote to me and said she shopped for an ObamaCare plan and found that she would have to pay $9,000 out-of-pocket before her insurance kicks in. She told me she doesn't know where that money would come from, and of course that makes that policy too expensive to use.  For the past 7 years, ObamaCare has not been working, and it will never work for the American people. Republicans are not going to accept failure. That is why we are working so hard to put together what we have promised the people of this country for the last 7 years--to repeal and replace. Pointing out the shortcomings of affordable care, we aim for better, and that is what guides us as we continue to work on repealing and replacing this failed law.  I yield the floor.

12641,topic-id,647,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to ask for support for H.2480, the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand  I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers for their support, as well as Congresswoman Karen Bass, Congressman Steve Chabot, and Congressman William Lacy Clay from Missouri, my friend, who have all co-led this effort with me.  The Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act expands the authority of the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Program, or Byrne JAG, to enable law enforcement agencies to compete for Federal funding specifically to develop and execute sex trafficking demand reduction programs. Adding this provision provides State and local agencies more flexibility in balancing precious resources to address sex trafficking.  Today, when many Americans hear the term ``sex trafficking,'' they might envision a young woman in Eastern Europe being abducted or a far-away brothel in While both of these instances, sadly, happen, Americans must realize that sex trafficking happens in thousands of neighborhoods and cities all across our great country.  As recently as May, in the city of Springfield, Missouri, there were two[[Page H5491]]young girls, ages 13 and 14, that were recently rescued. Those two innocent girls were locked in a neighborhood home and forced to do drugs and engage in sexual acts for money. After some heroic police work, the man responsible was caught, but not before he robbed these two young girls of their innocence and confined them to years of mental torment.  This type of event occurs all too often and serves as a stark reminder that this horrendous crime can occur anywhere. It is a domestic problem that we cannot ignore.  Since 2007, the National Human Trafficking Hotline has reported 22,191 sex trafficking cases in the United States, and countless cases remain unreported.  According to leading researchers and law enforcement agencies, one of the primary causes of sex trafficking is consumer-level demand for commercial sex. Sex traffickers have discovered that illicit support of commercial sex is a lucrative business. In 2014, the Urban Institute estimated that the underground sex economy ranged from $39.9 million in Denver, Colorado, to $290 million in Atlanta,  Despite the fact that demand is the ultimate cause of commercial sexual exploitation of women and children, buyers are frequently overlooked as offenders in crimes of domestic sex trafficking. Recently, leaders in the law enforcement community have discovered that the only effective practices for combating sex trafficking are those that include combating demand for commercial sex.  There are two primary ways to directly influence actual and potential buyers of commercial sex, and these are termed ``demand reduction programs.'' They are: education of actual and potential buyers of commercial sex, and law enforcement interventions aimed at deterring those who might buy sex and punishing those who do.  Many law enforcement agencies execute demand reduction programs, such as reverse sting operations, john schools, and community education. However, resource limitations preclude them from expanding these efforts. This bill provides law enforcement expanded funding opportunities to support demand reduction efforts.  This is a huge step in the right direction because the Byrne JAG grant is the cornerstone Federal crime-fighting program, enabling communities to target resources to their most pressing local needs.  Byrne JAG's hallmark is its flexibility; thus, States and localities are able to deploy Byrne JAG funding against their most pressing public safety challenges, such as sex trafficking. This allows communities to design complete programs, fill gaps, leverage other resources, and work across city, county, and State lines.  The crime of sex trafficking rips through the fabric of our communities and our country. We as Members of Congress must shed light on this horrendous epidemic and provide our law enforcement agencies with adequate resources to attack this problem at its source. H.2480 will do that. It is a bipartisan solution to a nationwide problem.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this effort.  ",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5488.txt,2032,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,12.0,May

12651,topic-id,1852,"Mr.President, last Wednesday, the Trump administration unveiled the outlines of a tax reform plan, and, predictably, the plan has met with both praise and scorn from the usual sectors. Regardless of where the people might come down on the specifics of the President's plan, those who have been proponents of tax reform--hopefully those from both parties--should be pleased to see the President of the United States fully engaged in this effort.  For 6 years now, I have been beating the drum on tax reform. I have sought to make the case for reform here on the floor, in public forums and events, and in private conversations, and I haven't been alone. Indeed, Members from both parties have acknowledged the need to fix our broken tax system and have sought to move the ball forward on reform.  One thing I have said throughout this endeavor is that tax reform, if it is going to be successful, will require Presidential leadership, and that was not a political statement on my part. With those statements, I wasn't simply calling for the election of a Republican President; on the contrary, I repeatedly implored President Obama to engage with Congress on tax reform but really to no avail.  As of now, we finally have a President who is willing to lead in this effort. Once again, regardless of where anyone stands with regard to this President or the specifics of his tax plan, the fact that he is willing to meaningfully engage with Congress and the public on these issues should be viewed as a welcome sign for all tax reform advocates, regardless of their party affiliation.  With regard to the specifics of the outline, I believe the President has laid out a set of critical core principles that should hopefully serve as guideposts as the effort moves forward. Most importantly, the plan is designed, first and foremost, to grow the economy, and it would certainly do that.  In addition, the plan would greatly simplify the Tax Code to make it fairer, particularly for individuals and families, which has been a shared goal of tax reformers from both parties and from both sides of the aisle. For instance, over two-thirds of taxpayers take the standard deduction. Those taxpayers tend to be concentrated in the middle and lower income brackets. Under the President's plan, married couples would see the standard deduction doubled, so that they would not pay taxes on the first $24,000 of income. It would reduce rates for both large and small businesses and job creators, which is also something both Republicans and Democrats have sought to accomplish in tax reform.  Overall, the President's tax plan would make our country more competitive in the international marketplace and reduce the tax burden on millions of middle-class families.  Clearly, as the effort moves forward, Congress and the administration will have to fill in the specifics. We will need to see how the numbers work out and where the votes are for any particular reform proposal. This is going to take some time, but, as the chairman of the Senate's tax-writing committee, I believe we can be ready to move in relatively short order. I intend to work closely with my colleagues on the Finance Committee, our leadership here in the Senate, leaders in the House, and, of course, the administration to finalize a reform package and get it across the finish line. The last major tax overhaul in the United States was more than 30 years ago, so we have a once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-a-generation opportunity in front of us, and I intend to do all I can to ensure that we make the most of it.  When I say ``we,'' I am not simply referring to Republicans in Congress and the White House; I am referring to anyone who recognizes the problems in our current tax system and is willing to do the necessary work to fix those problems. My hope is that this will be a bipartisan exercise. By and large, Republicans appear ready and willing to work with the President to get tax reform done, and I am working to find some willing partners among my friends on the other side of the aisle.  I have said many times that tax reform should not have to be a partisan exercise. Our current tax system imposes undue burdens and undue hardships on Republican and Democratic voters alike. Therefore, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress should be willing to relieve these hardships, and, as I have stated here on the floor on numerous occasions, I am willing to work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, to make this effort successful.  That said, I haven't been all that encouraged by the rhetoric we are hearing from our friends on the other side of the aisle on these issues. Setting aside statements we have heard about the policies in the President's plan or[[Page S2646]]elsewhere, the Senate Democratic leadership at times seems bound and determined to ensure that no Member of their party engages on these issues.  Most recently, the Senate minority leader has insisted on two conditions before he will agree to work with Republicans on tax reform.  The first condition is that Republicans commit to not moving tax reform through the budget reconciliation process. This is an odd demand, one that is, quite frankly, unprecedented in the modern history of tax policy. Certainly, the reconciliation process makes it easier to move reform through Congress on a partisan basis, but, historically speaking, most major tax bills that have moved through reconciliation have had bipartisan support. There is no reason, if agreements are reached on policy, that Democrats could not agree to support a tax reform package moved through reconciliation, so taking it categorically off the table before discussions even begin seems, at best, counterintuitive.  History tells us that reconciliation need not be partisan. In fact, when Republicans have had control of both Houses of Congress and the White House, we have enacted tax reconciliation bills that have enjoyed some Senate Democratic support.  It is also worth noting that at various points in the recent past, Republicans have stayed at the negotiating table, participating in formal and informal discussions on major policy matters with reconciliation instructions in place and without any assurances that reconciliation would not be used. Are Democrats going to be more amenable to compromising on policy if reconciliation is not on the table? It is hard to see why that would be the case. Taking reconciliation off the table would really only make it easier for Democrats to prevent any kind of tax reform from passing.  So, essentially, what some of my Democratic colleagues are saying is that before they will even enter into talks on tax reform, they want us to ensure upfront that they will have the ability to block the bill once it is brought up. As I said, that is an odd demand, and not one you would expect to hear from someone who is willing to negotiate in good faith.  My colleagues' second precondition for working with us on tax reform is that President Trump release his tax returns. Like their first demand, this one makes me doubt whether the Senate Democratic leadership really wants to be constructive on tax reform. This is a political demand, pure and simple, likely poll-tested and focus-grouped to please the Democrats' base. I don't imagine this demand is really about uncovering conflicts of interest in tax reform. If it is, it is a horribly misguided strategy.  After all, if tax reform were to succeed, the President is only one small part of the equation. There are 435 Members of the House of Representatives and 100 Senators, all of whom would be called upon to vote either for or against the tax reform bill, and whether a Member of Congress supports or opposes a particular bill, a conflict of interest could potentially influence that decision, just as one could theoretically influence a President's decision to sign or veto a bill. Yet I don't hear anyone from the other side of the aisle demanding the release of the tax returns of every Member of Congress before we can even start working on a bill. That has never been a prerequisite for working on tax legislation in the past, and it certainly should not be a prerequisite in the future.  In any event, despite these unreasonable demands, I will once again state that I am more than willing to work with my Democratic colleagues on tax reform, and I sincerely hope at least some of them will be willing to do so. I have been in the Senate for a while now. I think I have more than sufficiently demonstrated my willingness to put partisan differences aside and to reach across the aisle.  Make no mistake, I believe Republicans can move a tax reform package on a purely partisan basis. We have the procedural mechanism in place that would allow us to do that. But my strong preference would be to find a bipartisan pathway forward, and I hope that can be achieved.  Speaking more broadly, whether we move forward on a partisan or bipartisan basis, being successful on tax reform is going to require that we practice the art of the doable. There are a lot of ideas out there on tax reform and no shortage of competing interests. I have my own ideas and proposals that I have been working on for a number of years that I would like to see included in the final package. However, no idea should be considered more important than the broader goals of tax reform. That goes for my ideas and those of anyone else in Congress or in the administration.  There is a great deal of consensus among Republicans on the most important tax reform policies and principles. In fact, I would say we agree on roughly 80 percent of the key issues, which is a good starting point. I will not go into specifics today, but there are some high-profile items in the remaining 20 percent, and there are some differences of opinion regarding most of those items.  Bridging that gap and finding the path forward is going to take some serious negotiation and compromise. My hope is that people will be willing to adjust their expectations and bend on their preferences in order to achieve success in this very important endeavor. Speaking for myself, I can say that I would be willing to do so, and I have confidence that my colleagues who will also be playing leadership roles in this effort are similarly willing. Perhaps most importantly, I believe the President and his advisers in the administration are willing to make the necessary compromises to finally make tax reform a success.  This is the closest we have been to success in tax reform in the past three decades. I hope both parties, both Chambers, both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue are up to that challenge.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

12599,topic-id,1261,"Mr.President, I am speaking today because proponents of TrumpCare have their heads stuck in the sand. Many of the Republicans in this Chamber are clearly in denial that we live in a country where 91 Americans die each and every day from an opioid overdose; where 1.3 million Americans went to the hospital for an opioid-related issue in 2014; where 2,000 Massachusetts residents died from an opioid overdose just last year, and 69 percent of those cases had the illicit opioid fentanyl in their bodies. If people across the country were dying from overdoses at the same rate as in Massachusetts, that would be 100,000 people per year--two Vietnam wars' worth of deaths every single year. Over 10 years, that would be 1 million people who die if they were dying at the same rate as they are in Massachusetts--1 million people over 10 years dying from opioid overdoses in our country.  If these Republicans took their heads out of the sand, they would hear the near-unanimous calls from the experts and the pleas of mothers and fathers to stop this machete to Medicaid which they have brought with their new healthcare reform bill. They would hear the alarm bells Americans across the country are ringing against this cruel and heartless and immoral legislation.  These desperate voices should be enough to get Republicans to abandon their efforts to rip away insurance coverage for treatment and recovery services for Americans struggling with substance use disorders, but instead of accepting the truth and listening to their constituents, they have decided to take a cynical path and replace these lifesaving services with a paltry opioid fund of $45 billion over 10 years.  There has been a lot of talk from the Republicans about so-called fixes that they can work on with Democrats, but this opioid fund isn't a fix, it is a falsehood. It is a false promise to the people suffering from opioid addiction. It is a[[Page S3970]]false future that won't include critical Medicaid funding for treatment and recovery services. It is a false bargain that Republicans will make at the expense of families desperate for opioid addiction treatment.  This opioid fund is a politically craven effort to buy votes from Republicans whose States are being ravaged by the prescription drug, heroin, and fentanyl crisis, but the American people will not be fooled. This opioid funding is nothing more than a public health pittance, a wholly inadequate response to our Nation's preeminent healthcare crisis. In fact, the amount included in this latest version of TrumpCare is not even half of the amount that the Affordable Care Act would have spent on covering opioid use disorder treatment if we just left that law alone to work as intended.  Here are the numbers. The Center for American Progress has estimated that the Affordable Care Act would spend $91 billion for opioid coverage alone over the next decade, compared to the $45 billion the Republicans are putting into their bill which they announced today.  We already know that access to treatment is a challenge. Only 1 in 10 Americans with substance addiction receives treatment. There are estimated to be 2 million people with an opioid use disorder who are not receiving any treatment for this disorder.  It should not be a surprise to anyone that the epidemic of opioid abuse will only get worse as long as we have a system that makes it easier to abuse drugs than to get help for addiction disorders. And the paltry GOP fund that provides less than half of the funding of the Affordable Care Act is only going to accelerate the death sentence for the millions of people with substance use disorders.  Sadly, we know that my Republican colleagues who are attempting to jam this immoral and callous TrumpCare bill through this body actually are aware of the crisis facing their They speak to the same constituents. They read the same newspapers. They see the same obituaries of Americans who lost their lives to the opioid overdose epidemic. And that is why we have been able to make some bipartisan progress. Last year, we passed the CARA bill. We passed legislation to fund $1 billion for treatment. But support for the TrumpCare bill and this opioid fund is a betrayal of all of that hard-fought progress we were making.  Republicans are turning their backs on their vow to combat the opioid epidemic, and President Trump is breaking his promise from the campaign trail to ``expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.'' Instead, they are moving forward with a proposal that would rip insurance away from 22 million people and threaten insurance coverage for 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder.  This bill would eviscerate Medicaid--the leading payer of behavioral health services, including substance use treatment--by nearly $800 billion, and all of this to give billions in tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.  One analysis has found that under the Senate's previous version of TrumpCare, Republicans provided a nearly $33 billion tax break to the top 400 earners, the top 400 billionaires in America, which is the equivalent of ending Medicaid expansion for too many people in our country.  Let's look at what they are planning. They are planning to cut from $91 billion down to $45 billion the amount of money we spend on opioid treatment in the United At the same time, they have $33 billion that they are going to give in a tax break to the wealthiest 400 billionaires in Where is that money going to be better spent in our country over the next 10 years--$33 billion for the 400 wealthiest people or adding that money back in so that we can have treatment for people who have opioid addiction problems in their families? What is going to be better for America?  Well, the Republicans say: We need all that money that would go for treatment to give it to the wealthiest people in our country.  They can afford their treatment. Their families will have all the healthcare coverage they need if they have problems in their families. But the Republicans don't care. If you kicked this bill in the heart, you would break your toe. That is how bad it is.  So, for me, this is without question, at the heart, a simple explanation of what is fundamentally wrong with this Republican bill. There are many other things wrong with it--preexisting conditions, go all the way down the line--but how can you, when we have this plague hitting our country, take all that money away and give it away to billionaires? It is just wrong. There are too many families, too many letters, too many conversations that we have all had with these families. There are too many tears that we have seen. So, for me, there can be nothing that is worse than doing that to families--taking away their hope.  This is going to be a battle of monumental proportions. All I can tell you is that for the 2,000 families who had someone who died in Massachusetts last year, we are going to make sure this is a battle that everyone knows because if the American people understood that they are doing this to all of those families who have an opioid problem right now, there would be a revolt that would rise up across this country. Over this next week, the American people are going to learn about what is in the soul of this bill.  I yield the floor.

It is not a statement about the President's current legal authority to amend, modify, or revoke a withdrawal made under section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands I believe our new President has all the authority he needs to revoke the Alaska withdrawals, and I hope he will do just that. If he does, precedent will be on his side. In the meantime, our legislation makes clear the position of Alaska, which is that we do not support the withdrawal and want it gone by any possible legal means.  Next, our bill would create a new nearshore Beaufort Planning The State of Alaska currently conducts annual lease sales in the area from zero to 3 miles offshore. The establishment of a separate planning area in the adjacent nearshore zone will provide a real, near-term opportunity to provide vital throughput into the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, known as TAPS, because of its proximity to existing infrastructure. Projects in this area are easier, faster, and less expensive.  Our bill would also provide for additional lease sales in the Nearshore Beaufort Sea and Cook Inlet Planning By lifting the withdrawals in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, those areas would be eligible for leasing in the next Five-Year OCS Leasing Program or a supplement to our current program. Frequent and predictable lease sales are needed to create stability and certainty for investors, Alaska, and the United  It is also important that Alaska and Alaskans receive fair compensation for any exploration, development, and production that occurs in the Arctic Under current law, no matter how much energy we provide for the rest of the Nation, Alaska will receive none of the revenues. That arrangement is widely recognized as unfair, and so my bill devotes a reasonable share of the revenues that will only be generated as a result of this bill, and as a result of the waters that are only part of the United States by virtue of Alaska, with our  We have divided revenue sharing into two time periods, from 2017 to 2027 and from 2027 onwards, to reflect our differing needs during the exploration, development, and production phases. During the initial 10-year period, our bill proposes that 7.5 percent of the revenues be shared with the State and 7.5 percent of revenues be divided between coastal political subdivisions. The division between coastal political subdivisions is based on distance from the lease tracts, with 90 percent of the funds going to areas within 200 miles and 10 percent reserved for coastal political subdivisions that are beyond 200 miles but determined by the State of Alaska to be staging areas.  In addition, our bill would allocate 2.5 percent of the revenues it generates to fund competitive grants for workforce development in support of OCS development, 2.5 percent to fund the North Slope Science Initiative, 2.5 percent to the Secretary of the Interior to support offshore development and the establishment of pipeline rights-of-way on Federal land associated with Beaufort and Chukchi development, and 2.5 percent to the Tribal Resilience Program established by the act. The remaining 75 percent would go to the U.Treasury, to help pay down our national debt.  Following the initial 10-year period, we propose to divide the revenues slightly differently, with 50 percent going to the Treasury, 30 percent to the State, 7.5 percent to coastal political subdivisions, and 12.5 percent to the Tribal Resilience Program established by the act. These divisions do not apply to what is known as the 8(g) zone, such as the Nearshore Beaufort, where Alaska currently receives 27 percent of revenues.  The Tribal Resilience Program established by our bill, which is national in scope, would provide grants for a number of critical purposes. These funds could be used to relocate villages or communities experiencing or susceptible to coastal or river erosion, to construct infrastructure to support emergency evacuations, to restore or repair infrastructure damaged by melting permafrost or coastal or river erosion, to install and manage energy systems that reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, and to construct and maintain social or cultural infrastructure that supports resilient communities.  The OPENS Alaska Act will allow our home State to produce more of its vast offshore energy resources, which is a priority for the vast majority of It will help us create good jobs, generate billions of dollars in new revenues, and ensure a stable footing for our State for generations to come.

12447,topic-id,1542,"Mr.President, I am here this evening to stand with the patients and families and communities nationwide to make sure they have a voice to continue speaking out against TrumpCare and to urge our Republican colleagues to stand with their constituents and join Democrats in rejecting this mean bill.  Before I go any further, I want to talk about an incredible group of families I met with recently who are making their voices heard against These are parents with kids who are battling serious and complex medical conditions. These families have spent the majority of their summer here in Washington, DC, sharing their stories about what having healthcare means to them.  The little lobbyists, young kids 3 years old, 5 years old, should be at home in their neighborhoods like other kids, but, instead, they are here fighting for their own healthcare and their lives.  I held a press conference with these families here in the Capitol, where their parents shared stories about what TrumpCare would mean for them and their families. They spoke about their worries and their fears for the future.  One story was that of Elena Hung and her daughter Xiomara is 3 years old. She will be starting school this fall. You can tell she is one of those kids with incredible energy, who just lights up a room. But Xiomara was born with complications in her lungs, heart, and kidneys. She needs a tracheostomy, a feeding tube, and a ventilator just to stay alive.  Elena has told me what it has meant for her and her family to have healthcare these last couple of years. Elena and her husband both have professional degrees, good-paying jobs, and savings in the bank. They have done everything right, as Elena put it, and played by the rules, but nothing prepared them for dealing with the expensive care Xiomara would need. The hospitalizations, multiple surgeries, and medical equipment have all added up to cost more than $3 million.  Elena talked about the uncertainty that TrumpCare has caused her family. Because of TrumpCare, she said that they are terrified about lifetime caps coming back and about losing their home or going bankrupt. If they lose their healthcare, Xiomara's 10 preexisting conditions may make her uninsurable. This is so wrong. The Hung family should be able to focus on Xiomara, the care she needs, and getting the right specialists and therapies to advance her treatment.  The Morrison family, whom I also met with, shouldn't have to worry about their son Timmy getting the care he needs.  Xiomara and Timmy and all the other little lobbyists deserve to be kids, live at home, to go to school, grow up, and just live. That was Elena's message to our Republican colleagues, and I couldn't agree with her more.  I have seen my share of contentious legislation during my time in the I have seen quite a few Democratic bills that Republicans couldn't stand. I saw Republican bills that Democrats would never vote for. I understand that some of my colleagues may disagree with certain parts of the Affordable[[Page S4132]]Care But what I can't understand is why anyone would ignore real life stories of their own constituents whose lives have changed and even been saved by this law. For one, that is not how you have a serious policy debate--ignoring your constituents and facts and fudging the numbers. More importantly, that is not what we were sent here to do by the people we represent. They rightly expect and deserve better.  What we have seen for the last 7 years--and since the Republican leadership began their efforts to repeal the ACA--has been truly unprecedented. In January of this year, the Republican leadership kicked Democrats out of the process entirely under reconciliation. Since then they have done everything possible to prevent not just Democrats but anyone other than their own party to be involved in that process--no hearings, no scrutiny, no public input, no expert testimony. When they finally released the TrumpCare bill after months of negotiating in secret in a room of 13 men, it was no surprise that it was immediately rejected by people across the country because it was clear that their bill isn't actually about healthcare--far from it. Their bill is about giving a massive gift to the wealthy and already well-connected on the backs of children and working families and people with disabilities and the sick and elderly.  So Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and millions of people have stood up and said no to this awful bill, no to increasing costs to families and seniors, no to putting insurance companies back in charge, no to kicking tens of millions of people off their health insurance, no to attacking women's health and rights. In fact, one study came out showing it was the least popular bill in three decades.  I guess it is no surprise that my Republican colleagues didn't want to defend this bill, but here is what is frankly appalling: What did Republican leaders do in the face of large-scale, popular rejection of the bill? What did Republican leaders do after Members of their own party said that they couldn't vote for it without massive changes to help more people? They made the bill worse. They did nothing to address the concerns that even many Republicans--Governors, Senators, and so many others--had about the massive cuts to Medicaid that would be devastating to patients and to our They did nothing to truly address the defunding of Planned Parenthood and cutting off access to care for millions of women. They included an opioid fund so insignificant that a Republican Governor said it would be like ``spitting in the ocean.''  When it comes to affordability and putting insurance companies back in charge, Republican leaders not only didn't fix that problem, they made it a whole lot worse. They caved to the most extreme Members of their caucus by including the Cruz-Lee provision. Now with every sweetener, every tweak, they have not only made the bill worse, they have made it unworkable, and even in violation of the Senate reconciliation process.  Now, as soon as tomorrow, the Republican leadership is saying that they are going to move forward with either a vote on their failed TrumpCare bill, a vote to repeal the ACA entirely--with no plan to help families who would be devastated--or maybe a vote on the disastrous House version of the TrumpCare bill. Nobody knows, especially our Republican colleagues.  It is like Leader McConnell is setting up Senate Republicans to play ``choose your own adventure'' with our families' healthcare. Even he does not know for sure where this will end, but he is clearly willing to do whatever it takes to get to yes, and so is President He is doing what he does--tweeting threats, stirring up his extreme base, sending Vice President Pence to twist arms to try to convince a few more Republicans to stay quiet about their very legitimate concerns. Yet, as we head toward a possible vote tomorrow, I hope my Republican colleagues--especially those who have already indicated that they oppose this bill and process--will demand better for their own constituents.  I am going to keep saying this until it sinks in, which is that Democrats are ready, as we always have been, to work with Republicans to improve our healthcare system and make healthcare more affordable, more accessible, of higher quality, and to clean up the mess that has now been made with their efforts to sabotage the ACA in order to jam this TrumpCare bill through.  Let's be clear. As President Trump and Republicans have tried to pass TrumpCare legislatively, they have also implemented it by undermining our current healthcare system. Unless they get serious and get to work with Democrats, families are going to face higher premiums in 2018, and they will have fewer choices--all because of partisan political tactics.  This fight is on the razor's edge, and Democrats are going to keep doing everything we can to stop it. We just need a few Republicans to join us, to stand on the side of patients and families and say no to Democrats will do everything we can to persuade more Republicans to join us, but what has made the difference thus far, what has truly mattered, is when Republicans have heard from their own constituents.  I am here tonight to strongly urge people across the country to ramp up the pressure in these last few hours. Keep calling and tweeting. Double down on your advocacy, and make your voices heard. Again, we have less than 24 hours until the Republican leadership plans to hold a vote.  Republican Senators, we also need to hear from you. Now is the time to stand up, do the right thing, and oppose TrumpCare once and for all.  I know a number of our colleagues are going to be coming to the floor tonight to talk about this, and they will be raising their voices and their concerns. I urge all Senators to stand with us tomorrow and vote no.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

There has been a great amount of love for this man and a great amount of appreciation for what this man did.  After serving in the U.Navy, he moved to Santa Cruz, where he loved surfing in its cold waters, so much so that he was quoted as saying: ``When you get screwed up, just jump in the ocean and everything is all right.''  Jack's love for being in the ocean was demonstrated by being one of the first people to create and the first person to market the wetsuit. This led to him and millions of other people being able to surf at any time and at any temperature.  He was a trailblazer not just in the ocean, but in life. As a father of seven and grandfather of six, he understood how important it was to preserve our ocean for our children.  He was instrumental in designating Santa Cruz as a world surfing reserve, one of only four locations in the world that preserve surf spots and their surrounding environment.  He created the O'Neill Sea Odyssey, an educational program on a 65-foot-long catamaran that teaches our children how to be stewards of the ocean.  Jack not only bestowed upon us the wetsuit and year-round surfing, he left a legacy for our children to understand that being in and around the ocean really can make everything all right.

12524,topic-id,532,"Mr.Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from Texas for sponsoring this CBC Special Order hour. It is a great responsibility and a responsibility that he has done remarkably well in governing the time and the topics on which we speak. This is a timely topic, Mr. In a single decision, the U.Supreme Court set ablaze decades of progress by overturning critical portions of the Voting Rights Four years after Shelby County v. Holder, voter protections that many Americans rely on are again under assault.  Following that decision, we saw an eruption of unjust voting laws. It is an unfortunate historical fact that, in the absence of Federal safeguards, some States will erect prejudicial barriers to voting. States previously under Federal overview were emboldened and, shortly after the ruling issued, blatantly added discriminatory rules that directly affected minority communities.  Sadly, one of the most significant and imminent threats to accessing the polls comes directly from the administration. Since the inauguration, the Trump administration has withdrawn from longstanding legal challenges to discriminatory voter laws and created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity that will investigate the President's wildly unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. These sorts of actions and rhetoric only reassure States that discriminatory voting laws will be tolerated and upheld in this administration.  I urge Congress to take responsibility and restore vital voter protections that have secured the integrity of our democracy for more than 50 years. Although the Shelby decision was one of the most disruptive judicial decisions in recent American history, passing good voting rights legislation will redeem America's promise of a fair vote for everyone of eligible age.  It appears that protecting America's basic right to vote will be a task reborn with every generation. Obstacles to voting are no longer as blatantly obvious as literary tests and poll taxes. Unjust voter ID laws, voter intimidation, and unfair gerrymandering create barriers to the polls for individuals from all skin colors and age groups.  Although these actions appear insurmountable, they are not. Voter suppression is an affront to the Constitution and will not be tolerated. If we continue to resist all attempts to turn back voter protections, we will be successful and once again stand proudly on the right side of history.  Mr.Speaker, it is unfortunate that this Nation appears to be going in reverse. Gains that have been made by people who weren't necessarily considered citizens when they first arrived here, but property, have had to look to these rulings and laws being created in order for them to have the rights every other American has.  The hands that built this great building could not vote, were property. But it is a beautiful symbol of this Nation's history. The ancestors of the people that helped build these beautiful buildings here will be rolling over in their graves to learn that equality and rights for all are still under attack.  So, Mr.Speaker, the CBC and, I hope, the whole Congress will be vigilant in this area, making sure that all Americans, regardless of where they come from, where they started, and when they were allowed and even seen as citizens, have the right to vote in this great country.

12449,topic-id,2502,"Mr.President, I am truly dismayed by what we have seen in this Chamber over the last couple of months with respect to the Senate TrumpCare bill.  We are expecting to take a vote tomorrow on the motion to proceed, but at this point, our Republican colleagues have not shared with us exactly what we are proceeding to. We do not know if our Republican colleagues will attempt to replace the ACA with their flawed TrumpCare bill or if they will just vote to repeal the ACA and immediately upend health insurance markets across the country. Not one of these options is acceptable, and I am skeptical that my colleagues will be able to come up with a better solution in the next 24 hours.  For an issue of this magnitude, we should be holding hearings, meetings, and discussions in the committees of jurisdiction, with experts from around the country, much like we did when we worked to pass the Affordable Care In that way, we could have worked together across the aisle to develop ideas that would improve the system in place, not gut it.  There have long been misconceptions about how the Affordable Care Act came to be. For over a year, we held hearings, meetings, and roundtable discussions with Members from both parties and had a robust amendment process in our committees, both in the Senate Finance Committee and in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions I served on the HELP Committee at that time and went through numerous hearings, open discussions, and numerous amendments, and I listened to my colleagues. In fact, the HELP Committee's draft of the ACA included over 160 amendments that were offered by my Republican colleagues. It was truly a bipartisan effort at the committee level to try to at least discuss the critical issues that both sides had identified.  This stands in stark contrast to the bill our colleagues have written in secret this year. Even some Republican Senators were kept in the dark, excluded from the process. There were no opportunities for experts, doctors, patients, and others to weigh in and offer comments. As a result, they have written a bill that is bad for patients, bad[[Page S4133]]for healthcare providers, bad for States, and bad for the system as a whole.  My colleagues even rejected the chance to hear from States in public hearings about their healthcare systems in terms of what has worked well and what has not. There are examples of States that have done some very innovative things and some examples of States that have had difficulties. We always say that the States are the great incubators for new ideas. Yet the process that was adopted did not incorporate the views in both of the cases--those in which States have done remarkably well and, frankly, when they could have done much better.  We should look to the States to see how we can improve our healthcare system and let them be partners with us in this process. That is what we did in the consideration of the Affordable Care In fact, some States had already worked to expand access to care before the ACA, most notably Massachusetts, with RomneyCare, and we looked carefully at those examples and tried to incorporate those successful ideas in a national model.  By contrast, across the country, Governors and Senators and State legislators--both Democrats and Republicans--are largely opposed to the Senate Republicans' TrumpCare bill because they know it would be a bad idea for their State and local officials have crossed party lines and joined together to get the word out about how bad this bill would be for Americans in all States and from all walks of life. My Republican colleagues must heed their advice and abandon this harmful approach.  It is no secret as to why my Republican colleagues have struggled to come up with the votes within their caucus for their repeal efforts. Their proposals are bad for my State of Rhode Island and bad for the country as a whole. In fact, many States with Republican legislatures and Republican Governors have done very well in incorporating the ACA and understand the impact this will have almost immediately on their healthcare systems.  While we do not know exactly what we will be voting on tomorrow, we have some guesses based on some of what Republicans have publicly shared over the last couple of weeks, and each proposal seems to be worse than the next.  First, my colleagues tried to vote on their TrumpCare bill, which would have provided massive tax giveaways to the very wealthiest Americans at the expense of hard-working Americans across the country. This bill would have decimated Medicaid, cutting State budgets and eliminating access to care for seniors, children, and people with disabilities. Fifty percent of the funds in my State go to seniors, and it is roughly equivalent across the country. Typically, it is through Medicaid for seniors who are in nursing homes. If they were to lose that funding, the States could not make it up.  I think every State in this country is struggling with its own fiscal issues--education, transportation and infrastructure--a host of issues. When this money is pulled out, they will not be able to replace it. They will make difficult decisions about cutting back eligibility so that, ironically, middle-class seniors will be the first to feel the brunt of these cuts. That is exactly one of the areas in which we are trying to improve our system, not only of healthcare but of government. Even after doing that, I think they will still come up short, and that is when they will go into the education funding formulas. There are many States across the country now that are already in crisis, and this will just add to the crisis.  None of these fixes, I don't think, will overcome the damage that would be inflicted by the bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed that last week when it released an updated score of the bill to reflect some of the changes that had been made. The CBO said that under this revised bill--the latest one that has been evaluated--22 million Americans would lose coverage, just like in the previous version of the bill. It said that 22 million Americans--a significant number of our neighbors--would lose their coverage. Many of them are working families, and many of them have children with special needs, and they need this coverage. They would be thrown out.  I was at a Lowe's store in Rhode Island when a young man came up to me--probably in his mid-thirties--and said: Please, Senator, you have to stop this bill. I have a son who has a serious problem.  I believe he told me it was  He said: If, eventually, they remove the lifetime limits on healthcare insurance, as they are talking about, I will be done. I have employer healthcare insurance. I have a good job, and I have benefits, but if they put those lifetime limits back again, I will be bankrupt. My son will not have the care, or he will only get the care through some type of--something--some extraordinary method.  That is the reality. These are our neighbors.  Similarly, the CBO said that out-of-pocket costs would increase across the board and that care would be prohibitively expensive for the sickest and poorest amongst us. That is one of the great ironies here--that the sickest would be paying more and more and more.  The CBO was not misled by these so-called fixes that have come into the bill. In fact, we know that the reality would be even worse, I believe, than the CBO has predicted because it has not taken into account a provision that was added too late to be scored--a provision that would bifurcate insurance markets and separate the sick from the healthy, which would lead to a death spiral in the market that would all but certainly collapse the market. They are plans that are not really insurance. They are kind of--I don't know what they are. In fact, the CBO could not even call them insurance. But that would qualify as a plan. The healthiest, youngest people would buy it because it would be cheap, and they would have some kind of sense of protection, driving the sickest and older people into other plans, which would increase their costs and, in fact, create this bifurcated system in which either young, healthy people would not have insurance or they would have this insurance, which would not be insurance when they need it. Then you would have more and more people with chronic conditions and illnesses and just the accumulated health issues of age flocking to what is left and bringing down that system. It would be a death spiral.  If that were not bad enough, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided that the backup plan would be to vote on a bill to repeal the ACA in its entirety on a 2-year delay. They claim that it will give them an opportunity to work out a replacement plan. This is not sound policy. First, they have had more than 7 years to come up with a replacement but have not had any success. At this moment, there is this ad hoc ``What do we put in? What do we take out?'' The 7 years of supposed study and analysis has produced, apparently, nothing, and they have spent all of this year behind closed doors, coming up with something they think will work, but they have come up with the same results--the same CBO scores, basically. The real end game is not to repeal and replace; it just seems to be to repeal.  My other concern is that even if this repeal is delayed by 2 years, markets will not wait 2 years to react and insurance companies will not wait 2 years to react. They have to provide for decades in terms of actuarial values, in terms of their shareholders. Hospitals will not wait 2 years. They will see this coming to an end. They will start scaling back their programs, their outreach, all of the things they do, and the effects will be imminent. This effort would leave 17 million more Americans uninsured next year and 32 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade. That is the repeal-and-wait approach. And once again the CBO said this bill will lead to skyrocketing healthcare costs, for the reasons that I suggest: markets will not wait. Markets will move very quickly once they know this is gone. And since in the last 7 years we couldn't get a replacement, the idea that we are getting it in 2 more years is something they won't believe, and it will be immediate and devastating--again, another death spiral for the marketplace. But here we are on the precipice of voting on whether to upend our entire healthcare system so that, in some respects, this President can claim a victory over former President[[Page S4134]]Obama--not because it is sound healthcare policy but just because of that very complicated relationship. And it is not the right thing to do.  It is long past time for us to leave the campaign rhetoric behind, to get together in a bipartisan fashion, and to work out ways to improve our healthcare system. That is what we attempted to do with the We sat in meeting after meeting, hearing after hearing--the longest markup, I believe, in the HELP Committee--accepting and voting on Republican amendments and Democratic amendments. That is how we get things done--I hope that is how we get things done.  Healthcare makes up one-sixth of our economy. And when you walk into an ER or a doctor's office, they don't ask you whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, but whether you have insurance. That is the only question they ask: How are you paying for this? If you don't have insurance, then you are in an awfully difficult position, and we know that.  Everybody is going to use the healthcare system in their life. This is not an optional thing. This is not something that is designed for a special group of people. We all will use the healthcare system. And if you can't access it because you have no money or no insurance, maybe you will find a way through the emergency room or some other way, but it won't be the best healthcare and it won't be the most efficient and economical for our country.  In fact, one of the ironies of our healthcare system before the ACA is that we could have large portions of our population with no health insurance, not getting treatment for illnesses that could have been readily fixed while they were in their forties and fifties, and then suddenly at 65, with Medicare, which we all support, they can get treatment they need.  I had an ophthalmologist in my office one day, and they kind of looked around and commented: Well, you are right, because I see people right now coming into Medicare--65, 66 years old--because they had early onset diabetes, which could have been treated by a modest drug regime in their forties and fifties. They are now so sick that they have to have expensive surgery.  That is not effective for the country. With the Affordable Care Act, we were putting our whole Nation, we hoped--from young people, children, all the way through--on a path to good healthcare, so that by the time they get to Medicare, those issues would not be so important.  So I would urge my colleagues to abandon this effort, to begin tomorrow not with a vote on their proposal, but sitting down with both sides, doing the same process that we did. Again, one of the tests of life is, do you allow your colleagues and friends to do what you did, or do you insist they do something else? We are just asking them to do the same thing we did with the Affordable Care Act over many months of hearings and debate, and then at the end there was a vote.  We are going to see this for the first time tomorrow--the details. We still don't know what is going to be in it. There will be a vote, but it won't be an informed vote. It won't be a result of careful deliberation. It won't be a result of a bipartisan effort. It won't be a result of all the equity holders, including doctors, patients, public health officials, and governors, coming together and saying: We can do this better. That, to me, is a shame.

Extension of the Choice program is good news for veterans in my district. The Northern Marianas is the only jurisdiction in our country that does not have a VA medical clinic and does not have a single, dedicated VA doctor or mental health professional. There is one physician contracted by the VA on a part-time basis. But she is at capacity and cannot take on any more veteran patients.

12519,topic-id,676,"Madam President, on healthcare, we are only 2 weeks away from the July 4th recess, and my friends on the other side say we are going to vote on a healthcare bill before the break. Democrats still have not seen the bill. The Republican Health and Human Services Secretary has not seen the bill. The American people have not seen the bill. I am sure many Republican Senators have not seen the bill either. The White House spokesman could not even say if the President has seen the bill.  This is a bill that would likely reorder one-sixth of the American economy and have life-and-death consequences for millions of It is being discussed in secret, with no committee hearings, no debate, no amendments, no input from the minority. This is the most glaring departure from normal legislative procedure that I have ever seen. My friend the majority leader used to sing the praises of regular order and wax poetic about the wisdom of the committee process and an open amendment process.  Republicans criticized Democrats vehemently for passing the Affordable Care Act with only Democratic votes, and that is after we accepted dozens of Republican amendments during a robust hearing process. Now that the shoe is on the other foot and Republicans are in charge, all of those concerns and criticisms have disappeared. No committee process, no hearings, nothing--quite the opposite of what they called for 5 years ago. What gall.  Why are my Republican friends engaging in this farce of a legislative process? Why are Republicans willing to engage in such blatant hypocrisy, contradicting all of the things they have said about good procedure in the Senate? What are they afraid of? There is only one reason Republicans are doing this: They are ashamed of their bill. The Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it, plain and simple. They are ashamed that the bill will likely cause millions to lose their healthcare insurance. They are ashamed because it will increase costs for older and sicker Americans--all to pass along a big, fat tax break to the wealthiest among us, the folks who need it the least. No wonder they do not want to show anyone the bill. They are ashamed of it.  This radical departure from normal procedure on a bill of such consequence leaves the Senate minority little choice but to depart from normal procedure as well. Starting this evening, Democrats will begin objecting to all unanimous consent requests in the Senate, save for honorary resolutions. We will seek, in as many ways as we can, as many times as we can, to refer the House-passed healthcare bill to committee, where it can be vetted, debated, and amended in the open for the American people to see, as is their right.  Tonight, Democrats will hold the floor late into the evening in a series of speeches to highlight just how unprecedented this process is. If Republicans are not going to allow debate on their bill on the floor or in committee, Democrats will make opportunities to debate.  These are merely the first steps we are prepared to take in order to shine a light on the shameful TrumpCare bill and reveal to the public the GOP's backroom deal-making.  Of course there is another way. On Friday, I sent a letter to my friend the majority leader requesting that we hold an all-Senators meeting in the Old Senate Chamber to discuss a bipartisan way forward on healthcare. We should all share common goals--improving the healthcare system by lowering costs, raising the quality of care, and stabilizing the marketplaces. Let's sit down together, all 100 of us, and talk about how we can achieve those results together.  That option, I say to the Republican leader, is on the table, and I hope he will not refuse it, but if Republicans will not relent and debate their healthcare bill in the open for the American people to see, they should not expect business as usual in the                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3568-7.txt,1036,PANDEMONIUM COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE,2017.0,19.0,May

He is a fine man. He has great integrity, great courage, great service to our country, and no one has helped defend America more--both when he was in the Armed Forces and here on the Senate floor--than the gentleman. I respect that.  I respect that you always try to put yourself in the other person's moccasins. That was one of the great Indian proverbs.  I know he is doing that, as he mentioned in his remarks.  I would like to make a couple of quick points.  First, our Republican leader has chosen this week to proceed with three nominees under regular order. He could have advanced this nominee and a few others from the DOD but instead chose a district court judge in Idaho, a nominee to OMB, Ambassador to So I say to my good friend from Arizona, given the frustration he remarked on that our side has on healthcare, which is so important to so many--as is keeping a strong and fully staffed Defense Department--I would say to the gentleman that we would be happy to consider the nominee in the regular order.

Before I ask for a ruling on that, may I just say that the Senator from New York has a legitimate comment. Why in the world we would be wasting time on the Ambassador to Japan when we have the Department of Defense nominees in line is something I can neither account for, nor can I condone. So I understand the frustration of the Senator from New  Maybe sometime after our 2 weeks in August, perhaps some of us ought to sit down and talk and work out an agenda. We have a train wreck coming, as the Senator from New York knows. We have the debt limit. We have appropriations bills to pass.

The only way we are going to address some of these challenges, I say to my colleagues, with their partisanship and anger and dislike of anybody who lives over there, the fact is that we need to work together to work these things out, and we can do it without betraying principle, but we can also do it by understanding the priorities and the dedication and patriotism of those on the other side of the aisle.

12653,topic-id,1270,"Mr.President, late last night, due to the hard work and diligence of the staffs of the Appropriations Committees on both sides of the aisle in both Houses, the staff of the leadership, and so many others, we were able to come to a bipartisan agreement on a bill to fund the government through Most importantly, this agreement takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table. It is also a good agreement for the American people.  The bill ensures taxpayer dollars are not used to fund an ineffective border wall; it excludes over 160 poison pill riders; and it increases investments in programs that the middle class relies on, like education, infrastructure, and medical research.  It includes a permanent extension for health benefits for miners. Here, I want to praise--and I can't give enough praise--to the Senator from West Virginia, Joe Manchin, who was relentless even after disappointment after disappointment, at holding the Senate's feet to the fire and making sure this was done. Many miners can rest easy tonight--people who have worked so hard all their lives and had so much disappointment--because of Joe Manchin's work and what we put into the bill.  There is also funding to shore up Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program, and $2 billion to help States like California, West Virginia, Louisiana, and North Carolina recover from recent natural disasters.  The bill also includes a significant increase in NIH funding, which deals with cancer research and the Cancer Moonshot that both President Obama and Vice President Biden pushed for and continues onward, and a restoration of year-round Pell grants that will benefit about 1 million students. College is often the ladder up for a lot of students, and this will help them stay on that ladder.  And the bill includes significantly increased funding for infrastructure, as well as funding to combat the scourge of opioid abuse which affects all parts[[Page S2647]]of the country--urban areas, suburban areas, rural areas. It affects the poor, the middle class, and the rich.  Good news: It protects 99 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency's budget so their quest to keep our water and air clean will be able to continue. It increases funding for clean energy research as well. That is one of the great hopes for jobs in this country, as our Senator from Washington, Maria Cantwell, constantly reminds us.  For my home State of New York, I was particularly pleased the agreement supports critical programs that are greatly needed and very popular in my State, like the Community Development Block Grant Program, which so many smaller cities depend on; the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to get pollution out of all the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario and Lake Erie being on the shores of New York; and the vital TIGER Grant Program, which has done so much to support infrastructure, road building, and highways throughout my State and throughout  As I said, the bill explicitly precludes the use of any of this funding for a border wall. This is an idea that both parties rejected. A load of Congressmen and Senators on the Republican side have said that the wall doesn't make sense. In fact, you couldn't find one Republican on the border in the States of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas who supported that wall. Why? Unlike the President's promise, Mexico is not paying for it. There is no plan for the wall. We don't even know where we would build it. The Secretary of the Interior, President Trump's appointee, said: We can't build it from the U.side because it cuts us off from the river. Mexico will not build on their side. Where are we going to build it? In the middle of the river? And, mainly, because it is not very effective--you can tunnel under a wall.  We all want to prevent the scourge of drugs from coming across our border; so many of them come in little planes and boats. When they come by land, they are often hidden in parts of cars, in the carburetor or the exhaust tank--hidden. They will be able to come through because the wall obviously is going to have portals in it where trucks and cars can go through. So there is no money for the border wall, not one plug nickel.  We do have money, of course, for border protection, which both parties have always supported, and comprehensive immigration reform. Senator McCain and I, in a bipartisan bill supported by 68 Members of this body, made sure we had very strong border protection. But it has to be smart, it has to be cost effective, and it has to work.  Early on in this debate, Democrats clearly laid out our principles and insisted there would be no poison pill riders in this bill. We were able to knock out more than 160 poison pill riders from the final agreement, including the border wall, anti-labor measures that hurt the working people of America, and efforts to defund Planned So many women depend on these clinics for their health. And we were able to achieve significant investments in domestic programs that help the middle class and those struggling to get to the middle class.  Of course, this bill doesn't include all the things we wanted, but that is the nature of compromise. At the end of the day, this is an agreement that reflects our basic principles--something that both Democrats and Republicans can support. It took a few extra days, but we got a very good agreement.  I want to thank my friend, the majority leader, Senator He worked very hard to get a good bill. I thank the chairmen and ranking members of the House-Senate Appropriations Committees, particularly Senator Leahy from Vermont in our I thank Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi and all of their staff for working so hard last week and over the weekend to forge an agreement.  I must tell you, and I must tell my colleagues, the negotiations between our two sides were consistently productive and always respectful. Throughout the process, both Republican and Democratic Members and staff negotiated in good faith because we all wanted to get something done. I believe this experience bodes well for the 2018 budget and future negotiations between our two parties on appropriations. If we can show the same desire to get things done--the same mutual respect, the same ability to compromise--we can get a darn good budget for the year 2018 without the specter of a government shutdown hanging over the country's head.  I wish to say one final thing. It shows that when our Republican colleagues are willing to work with us, we can get things done. All too often--particularly from the White House--this attitude is just do it our way, my way or the highway. That is what happened on the healthcare bill--no consultation with That is what happened on this little tax plan.  When you don't do things in a bipartisan way, it is much harder to pass things. It is much harder to get a product that is at the consensus of where America is. I hope that not only will this successful negotiation on the 2017 appropriations bill be a model for the 2018 bill but a broader model that we can all work together to get things done for the country we love.

12506,topic-id,2132,"Mr.President, I want to talk this evening about a very serious threat to the United States; that is, the threat from North Korea and what we in the Congress should be doing about it.  Now, over the weekend we saw another piece of news about how the North Korean regime is again testing missiles, testing for intercontinental ballistic missiles, more missile launches, literally two in the last 2 weeks.  I would say this is one of the most serious threats facing the United States of America right now because what has now become clear, it is no longer if Kim Jong Un and the North Korean regime will have the ability to range the United States of America with an intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile. It is no longer if. It is when.  This has been stated time and time again in open hearings we have had on the Armed Services Committee with generals and some of the top experts in the United It used to be, hey, maybe he would have this capability sometime down the road. Maybe he will never get it. They are not saying that any longer. Think about that. Every American should be thinking about that. It is no longer if but when one of the craziest dictators in the world will have the capability to launch an intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile. It is not just ranging my State, the great State of Alaska, which unfortunately for me and my constituents is in the line of fire earlier than other States or Hawaii, which faces similar risks to Alaska, but we are talking about the continental United We are talking about Chicago, New York City, Los It is not if but when.  So yesterday in front of the Armed Services Committee, the Director of National Intelligence, our good friend, former Senator Dan Coats, when I asked him and General Stewart, the top military officer for our intelligence agencies, when they thought this was going to happen--well, it is a classified number and it is a classified time. I actually think it should be unclassified, given their estimates, to let the American people know what is coming because it is probably a lot sooner, at least in the estimates, than most people think. So that is what we are facing right now, and people should be concerned about it.  Let me give you a little bit more on the facts of this. Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, the unstable dictator of North Korea, has publicly stated it is his goal to develop a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile that can strike the continental United Now, let's just be clear. This is a man who starves his own citizens, sentences them by the tens of thousands to inhumane labor camps, and just a month ago allegedly assassinated his half-brother in a Malaysian airport with poison to kill him.  In fact, since assuming power just 5 years ago, as my next chart shows, Kim Jong Un has conducted more missile tests and twice as many nuclear tests as both his father and grandfather did in their 60 years of ruling over North Look at these numbers: That is the Kim Jong Un regime, Kim Jong Il, Kim Il So he is focused on this more than his father and grandfather were. As I mentioned, it seems almost daily there is another one of these missile tests or even nuclear tests.  Now, one of the things you see in the press sometimes is, well, some of these missile tests are failing. There have been failures, and there have been notable successes, such as the country's first intermediate range ballistic missile, its first submarine launch ballistic missile, its first solid fuel launch missile, and its ability to put satellites in space. This is actual progress. This is significant progress.  On the nuclear side, the country's fifth test--and Kim Jong Un's third--had an estimated yield in terms of its power of 15 to 20 kilotons, approximately the size of the nuclear bomb dropped on While this yield was not as large as they were expecting, the test again on the nuclear side shows steady progress in their nuclear program and steady progress in their ballistic missile program.  So what does all this mean? Why is Kim Jong Un testing so often? Even though he fails, he is still learning. That is exactly what the commander of U.Strategic Command said last month during a Senate Armed Services hearing.  John Hyten stated: North Korea is going fast. Test, fail, test, fail, succeed. They are learning, and as you can see them learning, they are developing the capabilities for intercontinental ballistic missiles. That is how it works in the rocket business.  That is happening right now. That is happening right now. That is in the news right now.  Also in the news is what the United States has been doing to protect our allies from this and other threats. So let me give you an example. There has been a lot of news about the THAAD deployment, a missile defense system in South Korea deployed by the U.Army to protect our troops and South Korea's citizens, to protect our troops in Korea, protect our troops in Japan, and to protect our allies. Now, I am very supportive of this--very supportive of this.  The President is on his Middle East trip. He is going to Europe now. He mentioned just a few days ago maybe having a THAAD system in Saudi Arabia, an American system to help protect the Saudis from the Iranian missile threat. Again, I am very supportive.  As the Presiding Officer knows, in our last National Defense Authorization Act, we had significant authorization and funding to help Israel protect itself with a missile defense system, the Iron Dome system, where we have been working with the Israelis to help their citizens be protected against an Iranian missile threat.  Again, I support all of these. I applaud these efforts, I have supported them, I voted for them, but it does beg the question that some of my constituents back home in Alaska are beginning to ask, and I am sure other Americans are asking in every State in the country: What about us? What about the United States? What about the U.homeland? Isn't that where Kim Jong Un said he wants to launch intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles? It is. It is exactly where he said he wants to do it.  The bottom line is, we need to do much more to protect ourselves. We need to do much more to protect the United States of Yes, we need to protect our allies, but we need to start focusing a little bit more on home, and we need to start focusing now.  In fact, if we know this threat is coming, which we do--there has been testimony after testimony--I think it would be the height of irresponsibility to not start working on increasing America's homeland missile defense. That is what we should be doing.  That is why I have introduced a very bipartisan bill called the Advancing America's Missile Defense Act of 2017. Again, Republicans and Democrats are already on the bill. I believe the Presiding Officer is now a cosponsor.  I would like to paint a scenario that we all know will happen unfortunately sometime in the future--again, on why this bill is so important, why what we need to be doing on missile defense is so important.  Just think through the headline. Let's assume a couple years down the road Kim Jong Un has this capability to launch an intercontinental nuclear[[Page S3153]]ballistic missile to hit a lower 48 city. Well, we know that is going to start leaking out. The headlines will be front page, banner headlines: Dictator of North Korea can range Chicago, New It will be all over the news. It will be the only thing we talk about.  There will be enormous pressure on the White House and others to do something about this. On that day when we see the banner headlines, a lot of Americans will be very nervous. The American people and the American media will look at the people in the Pentagon, will look at the people in Congress, will look at the leadership in the White House, and will ask three critical questions. Are we safe? Did we see this coming? Have we been doing anything about it and, if so, what? That is what they are going to ask.  We know that day is coming. We are not sure when, but we know that day is coming--again, not if, but when. People are going to ask those questions. If we know that, and we do, we need to be able to say to all three of those questions--whether it is the Secretary of Defense, the President of the United States, or whether it is all of us here, the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, we need to be able to answer the American people and say: Yes, we are safe; yes, we saw this coming; and yes, we have the world's most robust, technologically advanced, capable missile defense system that will with near certainty shoot down any North Korean missile launch at the United States and give our President and the Congress the strategic time and space to make potentially world-altering decisions.  We know this is coming, and I think we should be doing everything we can in our power to focus on it, so we will be safe, and we will be able to say yes to all three of those questions if we begin to seriously focus on America's missile defense, which is what our legislation is all about.  Unfortunately, our Nation has not always been focused on funding our missile defense system, and in many ways the funding has been erratic. As the Center for Strategic and International Studies put it recently, such funding for America's missile defense has been marked by high ambition, followed by increasing modesty. I think the time for modesty on an issue of this importance is over.  From 2006 to 2016, homeland missile defense funding, adjusted for inflation, declined nearly 50 percent, and homeland missile defense testing declined more than 83 percent. The goal of our bill is to change that and change it significantly. Among its other elements, Advancing America's Missile Defense Act will grow our U.base missile interceptors from what we have now, which is about 44, to as many as 72 and will require our military to look at having up to 100 interceptors distributed across the United  The bill will also authorize the more rapid deployment of new and better kill vehicles. These are the bullets, essentially, on top of the warheads. It will allow a layer of space-based sensors and radars to track missile threats from launch to intercept, a technological advancement that would improve all missile systems to make sure we have a layered missile defense, whether it is THAAD in Asia, Aegis Ashore and on ships, or our missile system here at home--all of it integrated. Right now we don't have that.  The bill also will increase the pace of missile defense testing to allow U.forces to learn from actual launches of our defense systems and increase the confidence we have in our system and its effectiveness. This is very important. The Department of Defense needs to change the culture around missile defense, testing regularly and conducting more flight tests. Unfortunately, every test is not always going to be a success. It is OK to fail because we learn from failure.  I don't like to admit on the floor of the U.Senate that we could learn something from the North Koreans, but that is the approach they are taking. That is why their missile and nuclear programs are advancing so rapidly. They are not afraid to fail.  What we need to do is enhance our testing, enhance our missile defense, enhance our capabilities because, as I mentioned at the outset, it is no longer if, but when. That day is coming, and we need to be ready for it, and the United States Senate can lead in addressing this very significant challenge to America's national security.  I am encouraged that our bill has already gotten strong bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans because they know how important it is. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle truly understand the significance and seriousness of this threat, and I hope they can continue to support our Advancing America's Missile Defense Act of 2017. There are very few foreign policy and national security issues that are more important than making sure we address this threat to America's security.  I yield the floor.

But please visit California, especially Riverside,  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of 114, which prevents a funding lapse in the VA Choice Program while making critical investments to strengthen the Department of Veterans  This legislation is a significant improvement over the bill we considered earlier this week. It now includes leasing authorizations for VA medical facilities in 17 States across the country, and it includes several provisions that I introduced that will help address the VA's workforce shortages. This is what I hope to be the first step in providing the VA the tools it needs to meet its internal workforce challenges.  As I have often said, the VA's ability to provide quality and timely care to our Nation's veterans will be determined by who it hires.  There are nearly 50,000 vacancies at the VA that need to be filled. This bill strengthens and streamlines the VA's ability to recruit, hire, and retain talented and dedicated individuals. But more needs to be done to expand the VA's own internal capacity to provide care for our veterans.  The VA Choice Program is a well-intentioned program, but it has not delivered on its promise to consistently cut wait times or improve care. We do not want to be back here in January passing another short-term fix.  Starting today, we have 6 months to come together and develop a more efficient and effective system to connect veterans with the care they need.  Earlier this week, I expressed my desire to vote for a bill that avoids a funding gap in the Choice Program, while also recognizing the importance of a strong and sustainable This legislation meets that standard, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

Mr.Speaker, the foundation of American democracy is that, no matter who you are, we are all equal once we step into that voting booth. And the courage that has been displayed by brave foot soldiers who risked and, in some cases, gave their lives to guarantee that constitutional promise was fulfilled must never be forgotten, and this is really important to point out.  I mean, we have Representative John Lewis, who is a hero of the civil rights movement. But I always encourage people to watch the documentary, ``Eyes on the Prize'' so they can see how people were treated, how people were treated by law enforcement, how people were treated by people who were in positions of power, people who were active in the community, people who belonged to the Lions Club, belonged to the Elks Club, the way they treated people who were simply trying to register to vote.  There is one scene that I will never forget; it was about a woman who was trying to go and vote, and she was being kicked and shoved and hit and knocked to the ground by law enforcement in Alabama for simply trying to exercise her right to vote that was given to her in the early 1900s when women in this country were finally given the right of suffrage.  It is really in their memory that Congress originally passed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. And for years, both Republicans and Democrats reauthorized the Voting Rights Act, agreeing that equal access to the polls must be preserved for generations to come.  But sadly, Mr.Speaker, in 2013, that tradition dramatically changed. The Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder struck down section 4 of the Voting Rights Act and made Congress responsible for updating the The Court has left it to Congress to create a new formula for determining which States and other jurisdictions should be discovered under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to ensure protection against discrimination.  But 4 years later, we can confidently say that the Supreme Court ruling set into motion what most of us feared--that minorities and low-income Americans would have to face unfair and punitive barriers from exercising their most basic right as American citizens, and that is the right to vote.                              {time}  2000  In the years since the Shelby County decision, Republican legislatures nationwide have been in power to unleash an avalanche of purposely restrictive laws that have been aimed to keep, again, mostly Black and Latino voters away from the poll. Even when you do discovery and when you look into why these laws were passed by State legislatures, it is clear what the intent was.  It is a tactic that the Republican Party has indirectly endorsed, since they believe that trying to earn the vote of the growing minority population, that they would rather keep them away from the polls altogether.  Prior to Shelby, States with a history of voter suppression and discriminatory practices were required to preclear any changes in their election laws with the Department of Justice prior to enactment. But now, in the absence of an updated VRA, States no longer require the DOJ's approval.  I want to talk about my own State, the State of Texas, which has really served as an incubator for the suppressive tactics that Republicans nationwide have been eager to enact for years. I saw this up close and personal in the 8 years that I spent in the Texas Legislature, where I saw Texas Republicans enact SB 14, which severely restricted the types of IDs that voters could bring to the polls in order to cast the ballot. Texas Republicans claimed that limiting acceptable IDs would prevent widespread in-person voter fraud. As vice chair of the Voter Identification and Voter Fraud Select Committee in the Texas state house, I witnessed how Texas Republicans failed to produce any piece of evidence to prove that massive voter impersonation was occurring statewide.  Hearing after hearing--you can go back and look at the record, going back to 2005--I and my other colleagues who served on the committee and who were concerned about some of the voter suppression tactics asked the question: Show us evidence that voter suppression is taking place. We have time here during this legislative session.  That was what we would ask over and over again, and not one person could bring any evidence that this had happened.  Their flawed argument justified limiting voter IDs and instead favored an approach that would exclude student IDs but actually say that it was okay to use a concealed handgun license as a form of  What is interesting about that is that these student IDs, campus law enforcement, which, in the State of Texas, where I am from, again, if a kid has alcohol or if someone is roaming around campus and the police need to be able to verify who they are and identify them, that student ID that is issued by a State university in the State of Texas serves as ID for law enforcement personnel on those campuses to be able to verify whether that student is, in fact, who they are and belongs on that campus. That same ID, again, that is issued by the State of Texas could not be used to go and vote. It just doesn't make any sense.  When the law was enacted, of course, the DOJ blocked the measure. However, hours after the Shelby decision, Governor Perry enacted Texas' restrictive voter ID law. I became a named plaintiff in the case because I knew that, despite Republicans' claims that the law would disproportionately disenfranchise Latino and African-American voters--the State's own estimates showed that it would potentially disenfranchise over 600,000 Texans who are registered but do not have one of the required forms of And there are lots of different reasons why people may or may not have an  If they were born in a foreign country and they are now American citizens, they may have a hard time getting access to some of those documents. They may not have the money[[Page H5910]]or the transportation to go to the county that they were born in to be able to get the documents that they need in order to get one of these Again, there are costs and there are transportation and geographic barriers that may take place.  You may have people who were born in the country by midwives, and they are particularly African-American baby boomers and older that migrated from places like Longview, Texas; Marshall, Texas; Tyler, Texas, and they weren't really even raised in those cities. They were raised in smaller towns outside of those cities and they may not have those proper forms of  Remember, segregation was very rampant back then in Texas, and many people were born by midwives, were born in their houses and what have you. There are variations of spellings of last names. I have that in my own family. There are just so many other examples of that.  I am proud to report that two Federal courts, including the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is easily considered by most to be the most conservative appeals court in the country, have found the law to be discriminatory in its intent and its effect. Despite this victory, we knew that Texas was only the beginning. We have heard about so many other laws around the country that exclude people from being able to register to vote unless they have a passport, or unless they have their birth certificate, which makes it almost impossible for nonprofits to set up a table at a busy grocery store, for instance, on a Saturday and do any sort of voter registration. There are just all sorts of issues out there. There are organizations like King Street Patriots, for instance, that pride themselves on their ability to try to suppress the minority vote. Again, Texas was only the beginning. And, sadly, Mr.Speaker, unless we can find a new way to come together to do what is right when it comes to suffrage in this country, it seems like this is going to be something that we have to fight for a long time.  Now, sadly, I am ashamed to say that our President has also taken a page out of the Republican playbook and has begun to perpetuate the same myths about widespread voter fraud that, sadly, we have been fighting since the Reconstruction era, Mr.Very, very, very sad.  Nearly 3 months after winning the Presidency, President Trump could not handle the fact that, despite winning the Presidency, he lost the popular vote. An unsatisfied with the results, President Trump does what he does best: he went to Twitter to blame his unpopularity on widespread voter fraud.  And, worse, now he has created this Presidential commission on election integrity. It is a sham commission that will, no doubt, work to justify claims that elections are being compromised by our own citizens and serve as a catalyst to continue the wave of voter suppression and intimidation that we have witnessed across this country.  I am proud that the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Asian Pacific American Caucus have all gotten together to introduce legislation to ensure that not a single dollar from the taxpayers is spent towards this phony commission.  Again, I think that everybody should be concerned about this commission. Any commission that wants to gather private information on citizens, put it in a database, information that--quite frankly, mistakes that people made back when they were in college. There are a lot of people out there that I know, that I went to high school and college with, people that I have known around the Fort Worth and Dallas community for a long time, all around the State of Texas, they made mistakes when they were younger. Maybe it was a Maybe it was some other sort of issue, but they have assimilated themselves back into society. They are working. They are paying taxes. And the fact that this database would want to take the mistakes that they made in their youth and put them in this database and to look at whether or not they are committing some sort of fraud is just something that--again, doesn't matter if you are Democrat or Republican, there are a lot of people out there who made mistakes when they were younger. It is just awful that this could come back to haunt them.  The fact is that the voter fraud myth has been debunked by various reputable research organizations, including the ACLU, the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, and the Pew Research Center, to name a few. But that has not changed the fact that Republicans and now our President want to turn back the clock on voting rights. It is really sad, Mr. The commission recently requested sensitive voter information as part of their fake investigation, and we are already seeing the effects. Out of fear of having their Social Security, voting history, party affiliation, again, their criminal background history that I talked about in a concentrated voter base, news sources have already reported voters deregistering to vote. That is sad because that is exactly the type of voter intimidation that Republicans want to nationalize.  House Republicans have purposely dragged their feet on updating the VRA and ignored their duty to uphold the Constitution and ensure the sacred right of all Americans to be able to cast their vote.  Even as these courts begin to rule against the purposely prejudiced tactics of these GOP State legislatures, it is up to us to bring our voices together and lift the veil on their true intentions. It is our duty now to stand up against these discriminatory practices that are being implemented nationwide, because the President's sham commission will have its first meeting this Wednesday, and we have to send one message loud and clear: We will not allow voter suppression to become normal.

And Members will hear from Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes and others about the President's voter fraud commission and the bipartisan backlash that it is facing.

I rise today and associate myself with the words of my friend and our chairman, the gentleman from I strongly recommend support for the newly amended 114, a bill, as the chairman so clearly stated, that not only extends veterans' access to care in the community, but provides additional funding for 28 critical leases to expand capacity and also makes sure we can recruit and retain the best medical professionals.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to note that on Monday, someone, another Member, mentioned that they felt a disturbance in the force on Monday is the way they described it. There has been a reputation that I think is rightfully earned from the leadership of the chairman and the members of the committee that the House Veterans' Affairs Committee is here to do the business of this Nation's veterans and the taxpayers and that the politics that are necessary and that are a part of getting things done take a backseat to that.  What you saw on Monday were disagreements. We could not come to an agreement. But instead of the theatrics of partisanship and instead of the politics of deconstruction, it was the politics of the possible. So instead of sulking away or sending out competing press releases, we came back together to try to find compromise on this. For that I am grateful.  I am grateful as a veteran, and I am grateful as a citizen that, on a morning when many Americans are waking up wondering about our politics and seeing the theatrics that go on, I am here to tell you that under the chairman's leadership, the honorable gentleman from Tennessee, he is guiding this House and tying it into the Senate in the best interests of our Nation's veterans, taking in the concerns of the minority side and taking in the concerns of the veterans service organizations in a way that also means compromise on my Republican colleagues' side.

I would encourage my colleagues, let's show a strong sign not just to our veterans, not just to this piece of legislation that, the gentleman was right, is absolutely critical for the care of our veterans; let's send a sign to our fellow citizens that this democracy still can function, this democracy still can find answers, this democracy can put American citizens first, and we can walk away from this knowing that our job was to come here and do exactly that, and it will be done.

I want to recognize the Young Men's Christian Association, the YMCA, for their efforts to empower youth with the imperative skills and knowledge to prevent these tragic accidents.  Drowning is the number two cause of death for children ages 1 to 4, second only to birth defects. In Texas alone, 107 children lost their lives due to drowning last year. In 2017, we have already lost 14.  Mr.Speaker, these statistics are absolutely unacceptable. Both in Texas and across the Nation, there is an opportunity and a need to save these young individuals.  The YMCA is example of an organization that is changing the statistics for kids across the country. It is bringing swimming safety and drowning prevention to communities that historically could not obtain them before. It partners with local schools to transport kids to the Y for year-round swimming lessons.  I am proud to say that the YMCA of Austin is one of many across the country implementing the Safety Around Water program. The program strives to reduce these incidences by going into overlooked communities to provide the necessary resources for kids who otherwise would not have access to these lifesaving skills.  I applaud the Austin YMCA on its tireless efforts to save the lives of our children.

12624,topic-id,2687,"Mr.Speaker, I have a confession to make to you. In fact, I have two confessions to make.  The first is I have got a big group up in the Rules Committee right now. It is my Gwinnett County Chamber of It is an amazing county, tremendous diversity, tremendous record of success in solving problems. They have been up there visiting with leaders all day long.  I first met with them this morning while Mr.McGovern was down here on the floor during 5 minutes. I said: Well, this is a 5-minute time. You can step right through the doors there, if you would like to see it.  They said: Who is on the floor?  I said: Well, it is this fellow right here. His name tag is there in the Rules He is down there, #endhunger.  I said: The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern) and I can disagree on all sorts of issues, all sorts of public policy, but there is nobody in this institution who has a heart for service on the issue of hunger more than Jim McGovern does.  I said: Here he is. He is representing Massachusetts, of all places, and he has chosen to serve on the Agriculture If you are a Georgian, you serve on the Agriculture Committee because you grow cotton and peanuts and row crop after row crop after row crop. When you are from Massachusetts and you sit on the Agriculture Committee, you want to end childhood hunger, you want to feed people.  I tell you that as a confession, Mr.Speaker, because I am not going to confess to sharing my admiration for Jim McGovern all that often on the House floor, but I was with folks up there today who really do commit themselves to making a difference in our county. It was nice to have a colleague on the floor--again, with whom I disagree about much--who was putting everything he had, as he does every day, into an issue that he cares a lot about.  That is all my constituents back home want, Mr.Speaker, is to believe that we have sincere, earnest folks working on sincere and difficult issues. So I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern) for that.  My second confession, Mr.Speaker, is that ordinarily I really enjoy listening to the Reading Clerk read the rule. It gets me all wound up about how the process is. Of course, today she was talking about all the amendments we are going to make in order. We are making every single amendment offered by both sides of the aisle in order on this underlying bill.  I found myself thinking back to the days when I was a young man and I came up here with my class. I was sitting up here in the gallery, and I walked into the floor at a time when the Reading Clerk was just standing up there reading. There was no cheat sheet that they give you in the gallery, Mr.You don't have any idea whether they are going to read for 20 seconds or 20 minutes. For all you know, they are going to read for the rest of the afternoon, and it was hard to follow.  I get a cheat sheet here that my staff gives me before each rule. I didn't enjoy it as much today as I ordinarily do, Mr.Speaker, because there is a lot of procedural work in this rule.  We are coming up on a bunch of big deadlines. So there is the ability to bring up suspensions. These are commonsense bills that two-thirds of the House agree on. You can bring those up at any time. That provision is made in this rule.  There is the ability to bring things up the same day. If the Rules Committee goes up and passes a new rule, we can bring that bill to the floor immediately. Ordinarily that would lay over for 24 hours. But because there are so many things we are trying to get done, we waived that.  All of those procedural issues, Mr.Speaker, get in the way of my favorite part of the rule, which is that every single Member of this body had a chance to come up to the Rules Committee, offer their ideas for how we can make this bill better, and the Rules Committee made every single one of them in order. Let me tell you more about that.  This House Resolution 280, Mr.Speaker, is the structured rule for the consideration of H.1694. If you happen to tune into our Rules Committee web feed, Mr.Speaker, you can see it at rules.house.gov if you are not able to get up there with us as we meet sometimes late at night.  This House Resolution 280 is for the consideration of H.1694, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017. Now, folks know a lot about open records, Mr.It is that procedure--it is called FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act--where any member of the United States community board of directors--that would be any United States citizen--can write and say: this is my government, and I want some information about what is going on. That has been a very fundamental part of who we are as a people for as long as you and I have been alive.  What is unusual, though, is the way the Federal Government has gotten involved in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the tune of about $187 billion--billion with a B, Mr.The American taxpayer bailed out these two private institutions making the American taxpayer, making the U.Government the largest shareholder in both of these institutions.  So we found ourselves in a unique situation of having the American taxpayers in charge of an institution with no ability, through the Freedom of Information Act, to request information from that entity. It just hadn't come up that often. Thank goodness we haven't had to bail out folks that way in the past.  Mr.Speaker, these entities that Fannie and Freddie are a part--we called them government-sponsored enterprises--they just haven't historically been the subject of that kind of taxpayer scrutiny, but times are changing.  This bill, Mr.Speaker, went through the regular order process. Hearings were held. Markups were held. It came out of the Committee on Oversight and Government If you have not looked into government reform, Mr.Speaker, it is not often that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is moving unanimous legislation.  The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is a tough committee to serve on. I served there in my first term here, Mr.It is the hardest things about our government, how we hold each other accountable. Of course, where you stand sometimes depends on where you sit here. If you sit on the left or you sit on the right, you might feel differently about government reform and accountability.  This bill passed out of this committee on a voice vote, Mr.The most collaborative of efforts moved this bill to the floor.  Then when we got it in the Rules Committee, we had several Members say: I think we can make this bill better. I think we can make this bill even better.  These were Members who may not have had a chance to fix those issues on the Committee on Oversight and Government  Again, as I said, we made all amendments in order from both sides of the aisle. I believe that totals three today, Mr.But the take-home message for me is, if you had an idea about how to fix this bill, the folks in the Rules Committee made that opportunity available to you.  Mr.Speaker, we can't do the big things every single day of the week. Every piece of legislation we pass, unless we stuff everything into it, can't do everything for everyone. Candidly, I am opposed to stuffing everything into a piece of legislation. I am glad when we have an opportunity to move one issue, one subject, one topic at a time and deliver on behalf of the American people.                              {time}  1245  Mr.Speaker, this structured rule, House Resolution 280, is a good bill. It[[Page H2912]]is a good resolution that, if passed, will provide for the consideration of the underlying legislation, H.1694, which, if passed, will provide the American taxpayer, for the first time, the accountability that they deserve for the $187 billion in taxpayer support that Fannie and Freddie have received. I am proud to be associated with that.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Woodall), my friend, for the customary 30 minutes.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I first want to begin by thanking the gentleman for his kind words to his constituents about me on the floor. It means a lot to me, and I appreciate it.  I should tell him, however, that, even though sometimes people don't realize this, Massachusetts has a robust agricultural base, and, in fact, in my district, I have 1,832 farms on over 142,899 acres, compared to the gentleman who has 209 farms on 13,328 acres. So, in addition to fighting hunger, I am on the Agriculture Committee to represent my farms.  I do genuinely appreciate the gentleman's kind words, but then I look at the rule that we are debating today and it kind of spoils the mood.  Having said that, I just want to say to my colleagues, Mr.Speaker, that here we are again, just 1 day from our government running out of funding and confronting yet another manufactured, totally avoidable crisis, and instead of working on a bill to fully fund America's biggest priorities, we are back on the floor with--the only way I can characterize this--more filler legislation. It seems my Republican friends care more about looking busy than actually doing their jobs.  This rule provides for the consideration of H.1694, as my colleague mentioned, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017. It is a fine bill designed to strengthen transparency at Fannie Mae and Freddie I support the legislation. My Democratic colleagues support the legislation. The Republican majority supports the legislation. In fact, I haven't found one person yet who doesn't support the bill.  Freedom of information is a good thing, Mr.Speaker, and I support FOIA, but what about the freedom from the threat of a government shutdown?  What about freedom from the threat of a default on our national debt?  What about freedom to know what our President's conflicts of interest are and to see his tax returns?  What about the freedom from having our healthcare protections ripped away, protections like essential health benefits and protections for people with preexisting conditions?  And what about the freedom to know what Congressional Republicans and the White House are doing to our healthcare system behind closed doors?  None of this seems to matter.  But the most troubling part of this rule is that it declares blanket martial law, through Saturday, that allows Republicans to bring anything--and I mean anything--to the floor between now and then.  Now, I understand the importance of rushing something to the floor when the government is about to run out of money; although, I would point out that we are 7 months into the fiscal year and my Republican friends set this deadline themselves back in December, so there is absolutely no excuse for Congress to come within hours of yet another shutdown. But this is just the latest example of Republican obstruction, obfuscation, and incompetence that has, once again, brought us to the edge of the cliff. And, Mr.Speaker, this is no way to govern.  This rule would allow Republican leadership to rush anything to the floor within hours of it being released. Not just appropriations, it gives them blanket authority to jam us with whatever new disaster they cook up with the White House in the backroom of Capitol Hill, and that includes this latest healthcare deal that I have heard so much about this week.  Of course, with it being a backroom deal, we were relying on news reports all week to clue us in to these terrible new provisions; and it was only last night, around midnight, when the Republicans finally posted their newest healthcare proposal that we were able to confirm just how bad it really is.  Incredibly, this new amendment will make the bill even worse than before. Honest to God, Mr.Speaker, I didn't know that was possible.  In addition to killing the requirement to provide basic, crucial, essential benefits like maternity care and prescription drugs and emergency services, this new amendment will also completely gut protections for people with preexisting conditions. In fact, this amendment directly violates the commitment made by President Trump and House Republicans to protect those with preexisting conditions.  This newest proposal will allow insurers to charge an unlimited ``age tax'' to older Americans, and, to make matters even worse, Republicans have set up a system that would allow women to once again be charged more than men for health coverage. It will bring us back to those bad old days when insurance companies could charge women more because they said being a woman was a preexisting condition.  Give me a break.  All of this, on top of a disaster of a healthcare bill that will cause 24 million Americans to lose their healthcare coverage. And in addition, their bill would cut Medicaid by close to $1 trillion, and take that $1 trillion and give it, in the form of tax breaks, to the wealthiest individuals in the country.  Mr.Speaker, this is not the way we should be running this All of this is being done to appease the most conservative fringes within the Republican Conference in an attempt to deliver, I guess, a political ``win'' to Donald Trump so he can celebrate 100 days in office. It doesn't matter what the details are, he just wants to be able to tout a victory of some sort.  Well, this is not a victory for the American people. This would be a disaster for the American people.  It is no wonder that my Republican colleagues have been overwhelmed by angry calls from their constituents at home demanding that they oppose this reckless and heartless bill. As one Republican remarked: ``I spent the whole work period hearing from people pissed about preexisting conditions. This isn't helpful.'' That is one of my Republican colleagues.  Now, under this rule, these dangerous backroom deals could be rushed to the floor without any proper deliberations, but they will have a very real, very serious, and very dangerous consequence for millions of Real lives are at stake here.  Now, I can't help but also note that this newest amendment exempts Congress from the terrible impacts of this proposal. Can you believe that? Knowing just how damaging these new provisions are, Republicans wanted to keep healthcare protections for themselves but set up another system for their constituents.  Now, it was only after the press caught Republicans with their hands in the cookie jar that they introduced yet another bill to unexempt themselves. But the new bill to unexempt Congress would require a 60-vote supermajority in the What are the odds that is going to happen, Mr.Speaker?  Are we seriously supposed to trust that they won't exempt themselves from this terrible plan, to trust that the Senate can muster 60 votes to pass this provision or anything else?  Let me be clear: this maneuver is a procedural sleight of hand. This is legislative smoke and mirrors designed to give Republicans, who tried to pull a fast one and got caught, a talking point.  Mr.Speaker, Republicans wrote this bill, so change the damn bill. Don't just say: ``Trust us. We will pass another bill to fix the fix, and we will get the Senate not to make any changes. Oh, while we are at it, we will get a supermajority in the Senate to support it.'' Who do you think you are fooling, Mr.Speaker?  I urge all my colleagues to defeat this martial law rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I would tell my friend that I think this is exactly the right way to be moving legislation, and I am proud that we are doing it. Big bills are hard and big[[Page H2913]]bills are sloppy. Can we do better on big bills? Of course we can. Of course we can.  But you and I have been on the Rules Committee together, Mr.The Rules Committee process, you have seen it happen. If I am down here talking about a small bill that everybody agrees on, folks want to know why it is we are not doing something bigger. And when I bring a big bill down here tomorrow, folks are going to want to know why I have rushed it to the floor and we are not doing something that has more bipartisan agreement on it instead.

I think our problem is the fact that we are at the edge of another crisis where, if we don't fund the government by tomorrow, we shut this place down, we shut the government down, and that has an impact on the American people.  I think what our objection is is that the rule that you bring to us here today to consider the underlying bill also allows my Republican friends to bring up anything they want between now and Saturday, including, you know, an awful healthcare repeal bill.  And by the way, when we talk about regular order, it would be nice, especially when it comes to the big things like health care, that we actually do things like hearings and listen to what experts have to say and our constituents and patients and doctors, I mean, a whole bunch of people who have a stake in our healthcare system.  The bill that my friends brought to the floor, that they had to pull, never had a single hearing and, in all likelihood, whatever monstrosity they bring to the floor in the future will probably not be the result of regular order. It will be the result of a backroom deal where very few people have any input.  So I can't celebrate today. I am very concerned for my constituents. I am very concerned for the millions of people who might lose their health care. I am concerned for this country.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question.  Mr.Speaker, President Trump's first 100 days have been embroiled in controversy and shrouded in secrecy. The American people deserve a heck of a lot better. They deserve transparency from their government. They deserve to know which special interests are getting face time with the President and his top aides and whether the White House is being used to personally enrich President Trump and his family.  It is our duty, as the people's Representatives, to hold this administration accountable, an administration that has so many conflicts of interest, financial conflicts of interest, that it is on a collision course with corruption. So, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Katherine Clark's resolution, 286, which would force the White House to release information to us regarding the President's many potential conflicts of interest, including his tax returns, involvement in his business empire, and White House and Mar-a-Lago visitor logs.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

12626,topic-id,1139,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that they had me at hello. When they said this was a great bill underlying this resolution and they didn't see any controversy, they thought we ought to pass this and they thought this was a good step forward for the American people, yet you had me. I would like to do that.  I remember, Mr.Speaker, a friend of mine, his name was Jay He served in this institution for over four decades. His job was not to be particularly partisan one way or the other. His job was to make sure this place functioned. I wonder what goes on over the 40 years of changes in the way that we treat each other on the House floor and the way that we work with each other on the House floor.  My friends have a perfectly legitimate concern. In fact, they brought it up as a privileged resolution already this year. It has been tabled. I recognize that my friends and I have disagreements--vast disagreements--in numerous areas of public policy, but today we have a chance to talk about one of the agreements that we have. I wonder, Mr.Speaker, what folks back home watching think. Do they think, just like the media loves to report, that, golly, those guys can't even agree on what time to start in the morning?  For Pete's sake, we have worked a bill through the process, just like we learned about in civics class. Don't make me sing ``I'm just a bill, and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill,'' Mr.Speaker, because that is exactly the process that we all want bills to go through, and we have done that here today.  We can't even take a moment to talk about how successfully we have worked together, not even a moment to talk about how the process worked, not even a moment to talk about how we delivered for folks. We have to shift gears to something that is not even the topic of the bill today. We will have time to talk about every controversy we want. If folks want to go fisticuffs with one another, I am certain we will make time for that, but right now we have a chance to talk about those things that unite us.  In the spirit of dispelling those myths, Mr.Speaker, dispelling those[[Page H2915]]myths that things don't get done around here, dispelling those myths that we don't respect each other, and dispelling those myths that we can't work together, I want to dispel the myth that what this underlying rule does is it provides Republicans with a pathway for doing whatever it is they want to do whenever it is they want to do it, because that doesn't really sound like fair play. I wouldn't want to support such a bill either.  What this rule does do is, contrary to the rules, allow us to bring up suspension bills at any time. Now, what a suspension bill is, Mr.Speaker, as you know, it is a bill that can pass not with a simple majority, but with a two-thirds majority. So this rule says, forbid the thought, should bipartisanship break out in the next 72 hours, you all should be able to bring those bills to the floor and deliver it for the American people.  Well, dag gum it, I support that. I don't look at that as a way of Republicans to manipulate the system. I look at it as a way for the United States Congress to deliver on behalf of the system, and I am glad we are doing it.  Number two, the bill says, if the Rules Committee, in its wisdom, passes a rule to bring a bill to the floor rather than have that bill lay over for a night, you can bring that bill to the floor directly. So my friend is absolutely right when he says that passing this rule would allow us to rush legislation to the floor. It would rush that commonsense, bipartisan legislation that two-thirds of us would agree on, we can rush those results across the finish line for the American people; and, if the Rules Committee acts and we pass that rule on the floor of the House, it will allow us to consider the legislation that that rule would bring to the floor on the same day instead of waiting 24 hours.  Now, what my friend says about having an opportunity to read the bills is critically important--critically important. I want to point out because, again, folks have so many concerns about what goes on in this institution, I got lots of things I can gripe about, but when we are getting it right, I want to make sure that we are telling folks that we are getting it right.  This tradition of self-flagellation in this institution drives me crazy because, when we tear ourselves down, Mr.Speaker, it is not us who bears the cost of that. It is our constituents. It is the board of directors of the United States of It is the folks who come beyond us.  We have a responsibility to lead this institution, and when we are doing it right, we ought to tell the American people that we are doing it right. For example, there might be a healthcare vote that comes to the floor of this House in the next 24, 48 hours. I don't want to get my expectations high for that, Mr.Speaker, but I sure would be enthusiastic if that happened. If that were to happen, my friend is exactly right: we will go to the Rules Committee; we will pass a rule; we will bring it to the floor; and we will bring it up the same day. But the language was posted yesterday, and the vote wouldn't happen until tomorrow. So when folks say let's leave the language out there for folks to have a chance to read it, let's not rush something through, we have got 3 days built into the system.                              {time}  1315  That is not a rule of the I want to make that clear. There is no rule in this institution that says you have got to present a bill before you can pass a bill to read it and find out what is in it. This is not a rule of this It is a policy of ours. It is a policy of who we are and of let's do this; let's make this our commitment to make this happen. Mr.Speaker, it does not always happen, but most of the time it does. I celebrate that success.  Again, thinking about those things that unite us instead of divide us, I just listened to my friend, ",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgH2910-4.txt,2008,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1694, FANNIE AND FREDDIE OPEN",2017.0,27.0,May
12627,topic-id,379,"Mr.Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3\1/2\ minutes remaining.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Simply, again, I reiterate that everybody in this House, Democrats and Republicans alike, should be ashamed at the way this House is being run. The American people who are watching should be appalled by the way this House is being run.  I don't care whether you are a liberal or conservative or fall somewhere in the middle. You ought to have some confidence that what the people's House is doing is actually thoughtful and is actually in the best interest of the people of this country. That is not what is happening here.  Yes, the underlying bill that we are going to talk about later today, we have no problem with it. It could have passed overwhelmingly under a suspension vote. I am happy to support it. No problem.  I have no problem, by the way, with bringing up suspensions to fill up time as we try to get a resolution to the continuing resolution. We have no problem, quite frankly, with bringing up a continuing resolution in a quick fashion.  This rule continues a lousy process that has been embraced by the current Republican leadership in this There is no excuse for this. When it comes to big bills, big legislation, like health care, which is a very personal thing to people in this country, the American people deserve much better than this.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on this lousy rule and stand up to your leadership and demand that they open this House up not only to Democratic amendments but to Republican amendments as well. This is a deliberative body. We ought to be able to deliberate.  On big issues like health care, it ought not be some backroom deal that a few people put together. We saw the result of those backroom deals with a lousy, terrible, awful bill that would hurt millions of We ought to do it out in the open.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

12628,topic-id,2110,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I heard a group of constituents ask one of our freshman Members what they found to be the most surprising part of this institution, having served here for about 100 days, and it was with no small amount of joy that they gave exactly the same answer that I would have given after my first 100 days. They said to their constituents: What really surprised me is how earnest, hardworking, conscientious, dedicated, and how committed each and every Member of this institution is.  There are a couple of bad apples that don't follow under that perspective, but, by and large, the surprise when you get elected to Congress is about the high quality of the people who you get to work with, the commitment of the people you get to work with, the conviction of the people who you get to work with.  What you have heard from my friend from Massachusetts, Mr.Speaker, I will tell you, is 100 percent authentic. There is no one down here playing for the cameras today. I could make a powerful case that while cameras provide a great deal of sunlight, they create a great deal of unnecessary heat, as well. Folks sometimes are performing for cameras in this institution, but not my friend from  What you heard from my friend from Massachusetts was absolutely sincere concern about public policy. I agree with him. I believe we should have an open and deliberative process in this institution.  You and I and my friend from Massachusetts don't work for the leadership. The leadership works for us. There is not one Member of the leadership team who votes for me. I vote for them.  We have an opportunity to direct the way this institution is led. Candidly, I couldn't be more proud than I am of the way that Paul Ryan leads this institution. He is not the Republican We have a Republican leader. The Democrats have a Democratic leader. Paul Ryan is the Speaker of the I am incredibly proud of the way he leads this institution.  The way to make it even better, Mr.Speaker, is not to cite every single thing that we do as a failure. It is just not so. Let's find those things that we do that we can do better, and let's identify them and work together, but let's celebrate those successes.  For example, my friend pointed to the number of closed rules that have come to the floor. For folks who don't follow the process closely, a closed rule means there were no amendments allowed.  Well, many of those bills, Mr.Speaker, were bills that the Rules Committee sent out an email to all of Capitol Hill and said: We are bringing this piece of legislation to the floor. Here it is for you to read it and digest it. And if you have any ideas about how to make this bill better, you send them to us, and we will take a look.[[Page H2917]]  When we did that, Mr.Speaker, not one single idea came back from the Republican or the Democratic side of the aisle for improving the bill.                              {time}  1330  So, yes, the bill came to the floor. The rule was closed not because we are trying to silence the minority, not because we are trying to silence elements of the majority, but because we had a completely open process, and it turned out that regular order got it right the first time. We don't need to identify that as a failure. That is an unmitigated success.  Some of those closed rules, Mr.Speaker, came because we were bringing legislation under the Congressional Review Now, for folks who don't know the Congressional Review Act, that is that act that was passed so that Congress could go back and review regulations that had been passed by the administration to make sure those regulations followed congressional intent.  By definition, those bills have to be narrow and targeted. We can't have an amendment about healthcare legislation added to our waters of the U.Congressional Review Act bill. We can't have folks go and add a pay raise for our military men and women to that Congressional Review Act bill. We want a pay raise for our men and women in uniform. We passed it out of the It is sitting in the United States Senate, but it can't be on a CRA piece of legislation. So, yes, every single one of those bills came to the floor under a closed rule not because someone was trying to silence the minority, not because someone wanted to silence elements of the majority, but because that is the process that we have to work through together, and, by golly, we are doing it right.  My friend from Massachusetts talked about what has gone on in this body. I will tell you, this body has moved more legislation to the President's desk for his signature in these first 100 days than any President since We have had Republicans running the show, we have had Democrats running the show, but it is only when we collaboratively have been running the show that we have moved more bills to the President's desk than any other Congress in modern American history. I am proud of that. Some of those votes went my way, some of those votes didn't go my way, but we worked each one of those through the process, and we did each one of those things together.  Mr.Speaker, I would love to tell you what is going to happen over the next 18 months. I have no idea. But I know that to the extent that this body is full of accusations, to the extent that this body is full of mistrust, to the extent that this body is full of frustration and condemnation, we are going to go down one path.  To the extent that this body isn't afraid to tell folks back home when we are working hard together, to the extent that this body isn't ashamed that we rolled up our sleeves together and got some things done that folks thought we wouldn't be able to get done, to the extent that this body isn't afraid to confront the fact that we are always going to have disagreements, but from time to time bipartisanship breaks out and bills move a little more quickly than they do at other times. If folks are willing to accept our successes with the same zeal that they celebrate our failures, Mr.Speaker, I tell you, we are going to create a different institution over these next 18 months. Again, not under Democratic leadership, not under Republican leadership, but under Paul Ryan's leadership as Speaker of this entire House of  We have one such opportunity today. I encourage folks to go to the web page of the Committee on Oversight and Government I believe it is oversight.house.gov. Those folks are working on some of the toughest issues in this town, and often they are bitterly divided along partisan lines. They are working on those issues that tend to separate Americans rather than unite them. They have sent us a bill today that was so widely supported, it passed by a voice vote unanimously out of that committee. It then went to the Committee on Rules, where every single Member of Congress was invited to improve it. Three Members of Congress took us up on the invitation, and every single one of their amendments was made in order by this rule.  Mr.Speaker, we have lots of things that are going to bring my friend from Massachusetts and I back down to this floor, and we are going to disagree heartily about those. Today we have an example of something that brings us together. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this rule that brings our OGR unanimously passed bill to the floor, and vote ``yes'' on that underlying bill, just as our Republican and Democratic colleagues on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform did.  Mr.Speaker, there are lots of challenges ahead of us. This is one we can put in the books as a success for our constituents back home. I ask for a ``yes'' vote.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 280 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution it      shall be in order without intervention of any point of order      to consider in the House the resolution (286)      directing certain officials of the executive branch to      provide information to the House of Representatives that will      enable the House to meet its constitutional responsibility to      conduct oversight of the executive branch by investigating      potential conflicts of interests of President Donald      The resolution shall be considered as read. The      previous question shall be considered as ordered on the      resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening      motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and      controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the      Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; and (2) one      motion to recommit with or without instructions.       5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of 286.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools[[Page H2918]]     for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and      allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer      an alternative plan.
