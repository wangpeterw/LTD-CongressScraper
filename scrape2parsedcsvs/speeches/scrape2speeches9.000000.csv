388,topic-id,803,"Mr.President, I am here today to speak on a different topic, but before the Senator from Minnesota leaves, I want to thank him for his statement and for his observations, which are dead-on about the need now more than ever to have an independent special counsel take a look at what has happened here. I am very grateful for that, and I believe that is the conclusion others in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats working together, will reach as well, as they let sink in what has actually transpired over the last 24 hours.                  Congressional Review Act Resolution  Mr.President, earlier today, in a piece of good news around here, a bipartisan majority voted to block an effort that would have wasted taxpayer resources, polluted our air, and accelerated climate change. I thank my colleagues who voted that way, in particular the Republican Senators who crossed the aisle to join us in this vote. Today, we showed that Washington can still come together to put the public above the powerful. Today we showed that, in the Senate at least, a majority still exists for common sense, for public health, and for good stewardship of public resources.  Before this morning, the Trump administration and some Members of Congress sought to undo a rule from the Bureau of Land Management that had been a win for taxpayers, for businesses, and the environment. Across the country, oil and gas companies pay royalties to extract from Federal and Tribal lands. Each year, these companies waste around $330 million worth of gas because of inefficient operations, from leaky pipes to excess burning, to faulty vents.  By preserving this rule, we will give taxpayers roughly $800 million in new royalties over the next decade--resources our communities could use to invest in schools or to build roads, bridges, and tunnels. Actually, the idea that we are giving the money is not right. The taxpayers will earn the royalties to which they are entitled as a result of these public lands.  This is a win all the way around. For public health, it reduces toxic pollutants in the air we breathe. For businesses, it cuts waste and expands their bottom lines. For the planet, it curbs leaking methane, which is up to 80 times more potent than a greenhouse gas and accelerates climate change. In fact, without the proper protections, natural gas can burn as dirty as coal, and the benefits that we have gotten from natural gas would be dramatically reduced.  Thanks to bipartisan cooperation, this rule will remain in place. I want to recognize Colorado's leadership in bringing us to this moment. In Colorado, we led the Nation to adopt the country's first-ever rule to reduce methane waste and pollution. The rule enjoys support from environmental groups, the oil and gas industry, and 83 percent of  Our approach was so successful that the Bureau of Land Management drew on it as a model for all Federal and Tribal lands. In my State, when we were thinking about passing this rule, critics said that it would stifle energy production, but the opposite has happened. Colorado's natural gas production has continued to rise, while oil production has nearly doubled.[[Page S2867]]  Critics also argued that Colorado's rule would kill jobs. Once again, the facts tell a very different story. In Colorado alone, 41 different companies put people to work to repair pipes, monitor pollution, and develop technologies to reduce emissions. Our experience showed that the rule spurred new jobs and technologies, reduced pollution, and protected the planet, all while failing to reduce energy production as critics alleged. Those facts were critical in preserving the rule this morning.  Because of what we did this morning, the national standard we preserved, our State will not suffer from higher methane pollution coming across the border from other That would have hurt Colorado's economy. That would have hurt tourism in one of the most visited States in the country, and it would have been deeply unfair to the people of Colorado, to kids with asthma and seniors who need clean air to breathe, to the next generation of Americans, of Coloradans who deserve a healthy planet.  Now that Congress has spoken, the administration should listen. My colleagues and I will vigorously oppose any attempts by the Department of the Interior to bypass, somehow administratively, the decision that has been made today. All of us need to remain vigilant to ensure that this commonsense protection remains in place, protecting Americans, protecting our environment, and I am grateful that today, at least, we can come together and put fact over ideology and put the public good over narrow interests.

519,topic-id,2230,"Mr.President, I join my colleague from New York in expressing the special respect and passion that we all feel in honoring this great holiday that remembers the service and sacrifice of great Americans, to make sure we sustain and preserve and enhance our democracy. Part of that democracy is indeed the rule of law, as well as protecting the institutions that make us great as a Nation, including our elections system and its integrity.  Today should also be a time to observe and commemorate the continued respect for the law that makes us great. Part of that respect was demonstrated recently when the Deputy Attorney General appointed a special counsel to investigate possible coordination between the Trump administration and the Presidential campaign with the Russians as they interfered with those democratic institutions. Make no mistake, there is consensus and unanimity in the intelligence community, and more broadly among us in this body, that the Russians purposefully and relentlessly interfered in the 2016 election through a cyber attack on this In my view, it was an act of cyber warfare.  The questions now are who and how in the Trump team may have colluded with the Russians in that illegal, outrageous activity and, indeed, whether there has been obstruction of justice since then. Mounting evidence indicates that there has been.  I have joined many of my colleagues in praising the appointment of a special prosecutor because it is vitally necessary for a fair and impartial, as well as aggressive, investigation. The special prosecutor must follow the evidence wherever it leads, and I have confidence that Bob Mueller is the right person for this assignment. He has the grit and backbone to stand up to pressure. He has the prosecutorial experience and expertise to conduct a truly professional investigation.  I called for a special prosecutor back in I was one of the first, if not the first, among our colleagues to do so because the conflicts of interest raised by the recusal of the Attorney General and the potential involvement of the Deputy led me to think that such an appointment was absolutely necessary.  I now call on the President to support this investigation. With the utmost respect for the Office of the President, it should be unnecessary to call for that cooperation and support. My hope was that the President would say as soon as the appointment occurred that he would indeed cooperate. But, instead, he has continued to characterize this investigation as a witch hunt and a charade. He has demeaned and disrespected it and indicated that, if anything, there will be less than full cooperation. That would be a grave disservice to our democracy and to the American people.  The integrity of our electoral system is bigger and more important than any single electoral contest or even any occupant of the White It is about the freedom and independence of this Nation, something we cherish and celebrate on this Memorial Day weekend.  I urge President Trump to demonstrate his adherence to the rule of[[Page S3166]]law by cooperating and articulating fully his cooperation with this investigation. I hope that not only President Trump but all of his associates will do so and that they will provide whatever testimony and documents are necessary to complete this investigation as quickly and effectively as possible.  I also believe that the Attorney General of the United States owes the American people his adherence to the rule of law by committing himself to follow the guidelines that respect the press. Indeed, we would know very little, if anything, about many of the events that prompted the appointment of a special prosecutor without the free press reporting development after event after development that have led to this day.  There are guidelines and regulations that protect the President against any kind of compulsory process or punishment. If there is punishment to be accorded to lawbreakers, the press should be recognized for the special role they have in our democracy and the special protections, the constitutional guarantee they enjoy under the First There are guidelines under 28 CFR 50.10 that provide legal guidance and regulations that should be observed, and I hope that the Attorney General will demonstrate in deed and word his adherence to those guidelines rather than threatening to lock up reporters--as the President has unfortunately done currently in conversations with Director Comey--or punishing them.  Whatever the violations of government officials may be, there should be an articulate, clear, and explicit adherence to those regulations by the Attorney  Let's take a moment to go through where we are right now.  Last July, after a disturbing series of reports suggesting the attempt by a foreign power to influence an American election, the Federal Government began to investigate the Russian Government's interference in the Presidential election.  We learned just yesterday from a published report that this activity included conversations among Russian officials regarding how best to sway individual Trump officials and that the FBI's early handling of this matter may have been influenced by an unreliable document traceable to Russian intelligence--a form of interference in our justice system that is stunning.  In December of 2016, U.intelligence officials concluded that the Russians had orchestrated the theft of electronic materials from the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta in an attempt to undermine Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign. The Obama administration responded by implementing sanctions on the Russian  Shortly after President Trump took office, Attorney General Sally Yates warned the White House that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied to officials about discussing sanctions with the Russians and was vulnerable to Russian blackmail. The White House waited 2\1/2\ weeks to take action and did so only after a March 9 Washington Post report and, in fact, days after Sally Yates' warning, fired her.  We also know that Director Comey was warned or asked--in fact, demanded by President Trump that he pledge his loyalty and that he would be in jeopardy of losing his job if he did not. Shortly thereafter, the President clearly expressed to Director Comey his sense of that warning when he asked Director Comey to shut down, in effect, the Flynn investigation. As we all know, Director Comey resisted both of the President's requests.  In early March, following sharp criticism about his failure to disclose meetings with Russian officials under oath, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Department of Justice investigations.  Later that month, President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, became the third high-ranking Trump administration official caught misrepresenting potentially his ties to an admitted meeting with Russian officials from his security clearance application.  On May 9, President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, a stunning event amidst these unprecedented revelations. After clumsy and contradicting explanations seeking to advance a false narrative that the firing was a result of Director Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email matter, the White House essentially abandoned that conflicting series of stories, and President Trump admitted publicly that he was thinking about the FBI's Russia investigation when he decided to fire He boasted the next day in his meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister that he felt greatly relieved of pressure resulting from that investigation.  The New York Times has reported that Comey was seeking increased funding and resources to expand the Russia probe. The Times also subsequently revealed that Director Comey had discussed with others and wrote memos detailing how President Trump asked him to pledge his loyalty and shut down the Federal investigation into Mr. We must wait for all the facts to emerge, but even if only some of these reports are accurate, the conclusion is almost inescapable that the President of the United States fired the FBI Director in an attempt to shut down the investigation into ties between his associates, including Michael Flynn, and the Russian The names of these associates have been well documented--Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Carter Page, as well as Michael  There is, unfortunately, more. Just in the past few days, additional disturbing facts and press reports have surfaced, including testimony by former CIA Director John Brennan before the House Intelligence He said that before he left office, he became deeply concerned that Russian intelligence services were attempting to manipulate Trump associates to influence the Presidential campaign. He noted that many Russian contacts of individuals linked to the Trump campaign emerged in those reports. The Washington Post reported that Comey had informed Congress about the FBI Russia investigation late in March and that Trump had asked Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and National Security Director Michael Rogers to push back on that investigation--in effect, to clear the President--and deny Trump campaign collusion with the According to this report, both officials, to their credit, refused to do so.  In the Armed Services Committee, I asked Director Coats whether he discussed with Director Rogers any attempts by the administration to interfere with the investigation. He refused to answer--a pause and silence that spoke volumes.  Revelation after revelation shakes our confidence in this administration's truthfulness and confidence. This investigation by the special prosecutor is vitally necessary.  We must not lose sight of the damage that has already been done. These reports paint a deeply disturbing picture of possible obstruction, a mosaic pieced together by facts that show not only events and conversations but also motives. After a series of these events and conversations, they can no longer be seen as isolated or accidental or inadvertent. The cumulative effect, like threads in a fabric, is to establish a picture of motive, intent, mens rea, and criminal activity.  Special Counsel Mueller must have the mandate and all of the funding and resources that he needs to follow the facts wherever they may lead--resources, independence--but also support.  That is why, again, I call on the administration to express its support and its intention to cooperate.  This kind of investigation can mean the difference between the upholding of our democratic institutions and placing them in jeopardy. Therefore, I urge that we as a body remain vigilant and continue the Judiciary Committee's oversight, inquiry, and investigative activity so as to assure that we know the reasons then-FBI Director Comey was fired--we have that responsibility as a matter of oversight--and continue that kind of scrutiny in order to assure the independence and resources the special prosecutor needs. Likewise, the Intelligence Committee's activities are absolutely necessary.  Almost certainly, the special prosecutor will produce no report or elaborate public explanation. He will bring criminal charges if they are warranted by the evidence. He will seek convictions in court if those prosecutions are[[Page S3167]]justified under his finding. A report with recommendations and finding as to how we can avoid this kind of interference with our democratic institutions in the future must be the work of the Intelligence Committee and of an independent commission, which I have supported. An independent, bipartisan commission can do the kind of public, transparent, vigorous, and independent work that is necessary, just in the way that we have done in the wake of other crises.  I urge that we proceed on all of these fronts. They are vital to our democracy. They are an essential, inextricable part of freedom, the rule of law, and freedom of the press.  I hope that the press will continue its unfettered use of its First Amendment freedom to give us the truth and to continue those reports that have brought us to this day, because the truth will be uncovered in the course of the criminal process. It will be uncovered by the Intelligence Committee and, hopefully, by an independent commission. The essential role of the free press in fostering government accountability is recognized by existing regulations, and the Attorney General of the United States should leave no confusion that the Department of Justice will adhere to those regulations.  Indeed, 28 CFR 50.10 recognizes the ``essential role of the free press in fostering government accountability'' and, therefore, sets parameters and procedures, for approval by the Attorney General of the United States, under standards that are set forth for any government action that may, in any way, inhibit or impede the press.  We will probably never know the real impact of Russia's intervention in the outcome of the 2016 election. These investigations are not about assessing the impact. They are about determining who participated criminally with the Russians in that interference. The American people deserve a thorough and impartial investigation into the Trump team's ties to that interference and the effort by President Trump and others to cover it up.  In the wake of Watergate, the saying arose that the coverup was worse than the crime. It was then, and it would be worse--or at least as heinous--in the crime here. Make no mistake that the crime is, actually, a theft of our democracy--an interference by the Russians in our democratic institutions--which they will repeat if we do not make them pay a price and, likewise, if we do not make the Americans who cooperated with them pay a price as well. This principle is central to our democracy and our rule of law.  In closing, I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for the cooperation of the Trump administration as well as for recognizing the importance of the investigation--its independence, its resources--for the free press and the rule of law.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                             Opioid Crisis  ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3161-3.txt,2076,FEDERAL POWER ACT AMENDMENT,2017.0,25.0,June

567,topic-id,1269,"Mr.President, a number of Wall Street banks, car title lenders, big corporations, and payday loan sharks have two things in common: They have a record of ripping off consumers, and they have armies of expensive lawyers and lobbyists in Washington, in Columbus, and in State capitals all over this country who protect them from facing the consequences.  That is why it is so important that ordinary American consumers have their own cop on the beat--the Consumer Financial Protection The recent abuses by Wells Fargo are the latest proof of how necessary the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's work is.  Less than a year ago, we learned that Wells Fargo secretly opened millions of phony bank and credit card accounts without customers' permission. The CEO of Wells Fargo had to resign as a result. This was an outrageous abuse of American consumers. The sheer size and scope of this scam are breathtaking. In total, Wells Fargo may have opened as many as 3.5 million unauthorized accounts--meaning, it opened these accounts without the accountholders even necessarily knowing that they did it, without permission--costing customers some $2.5 million in fees.  The abuses are bad enough. To make matters worse, Wells Fargo tried to keep this scandal hidden from the public, and it used something called the ``forced arbitration clauses,'' which are buried in the fine print of customers' contracts, to deny them their day in court. There is hardly anybody in this country who has not confronted small print in a contract when signing that contract, especially with a financial institution. Customers first sued over these fake accounts back in 2013, but Wells Fargo then forced them into secret arbitration proceedings, keeping this scam under wraps and blocking consumers from obtaining any relief.  Last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other watchdogs blew the lid off of this scandal. Customers sued once again, and, once again, the bank tried to block them from getting relief in court. This time, because of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the LA Times, and others who shone a light on the scandal and on all of the bad press that went with it, Wells Fargo relented. So, after two congressional hearings and a flood of bad headlines, Wells Fargo is cutting a deal in its phony account scandal. Yet now we have learned that this is not the only scam that one of America's largest banks has pulled.  Just last week, we learned that the bank forced unwanted insurance on 800,000 auto loan borrowers, potentially pushing tens of thousands into default and repossession, and it is still using these forced arbitration clauses in its contracts in order to cheat future consumers, including in the contracts in this auto loan scam.  The only thing more outrageous than the fact that Wells Fargo continues to cheat its customers is the fact that Members of Congress--a lot of Members of Congress in this body and down the hall--are trying to make it even harder for those customers to seek justice in their overturning the arbitration rule. They think that forced arbitration and the fine print, which most people do not read and most people do not understand if they do read it, is legitimate. No wonder so many hard-working Americans believe that the system is rigged against them in Wall Street's favor.  These scams have caused real damage for hundreds of thousands of Americans as 275,000 Wells Fargo customers have been forced into delinquency by being charged for unnecessary insurance, and 20,000 vehicles have been unfairly repossessed because of this bank's behavior.  Wells Fargo is not alone. Santander has used forced arbitration clauses against servicemembers. It is a Spanish company that does business in the United States and uses forced arbitration clauses against American servicemembers--again, for illegal car repossessions. In 2015, Santander used forced arbitration to block an Army National Guard sergeant from seeking justice after the bank illegally repossessed his car while he was serving our country overseas.  I see that kind of thing happening at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Air Force men and women are not always making big salaries, to put it mildly, as they are serving their country. They do not make a lot of money, and a lot of these young families struggle. Yet predators--companies like Wells Fargo and payday lenders--continue to prey on them. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stands with them. The CFPB is looking out for folks like the Army National Guard sergeant, like those at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and like those at the Air Force bases in Springfield and Mansfield and Toledo and  Yet, with all of this happening, some Members of Congress, again, are doing[[Page S4630]]the bidding of Wall Street lobbyists. The Bureau just finalized a new rule that limits the arbitration clauses that allow big corporations to get away with ripping off servicemembers, students, and other hard-working Americans, but the ink is barely dry on this new consumer protection, and big banks and their allies in Congress--and God knows they have a lot of allies in Congress and allies in the administration--are already trying to overturn this rule.  Last week, Republicans in the House voted to overturn this rule that ensures that all Ohioans who have been ripped off by banks or payday lenders are able to have their day in court. Despite promising during his campaign to look out for the little guy, President Trump's Acting Comptroller of the Currency, who is also--alas--a former Wells Fargo lawyer, is trying to get the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to back off that rule.  It is unconscionable that Washington politicians are undermining the rights of consumers to have their day in court when they are cheated by banks and payday lenders. Folks in Washington who want to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and gut its rules seem to have collective amnesia about the devastation that Wall Street greed has wreaked on communities across the country, but most Ohioans do not have that luxury. They are still recovering.  I and my wife, Connie, live in the city of Cleveland, with the ZIP Code 44105. At this time 10 years ago, during the first half of 2007, there were more foreclosures in that ZIP Code than in any ZIP Code in the United States of So I have seen the aftermath. I have seen what has happened with Wall Street greed and the kind of collective amnesia in this body whenever Wall Street wants something, whenever the payday lenders want something, whenever the big banks want something, and Congress rushes in to help them and to respond to their lobbyists and their lawyers who lobby this body.  It is pretty simple. Gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's arbitration rule means banks get away with cheating their customers.  So I ask Senators in this body to ask themselves: Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of the payday lenders and Wells Fargo when they defraud the public or are you on the side of service men and women and the side of people who have lost their cars, which were repossessed because of the unilateral actions by this bank?  Those are the same big banks that preyed on working families before the crisis wrecked the economy and handed taxpayers the bill. Is that whose side we are on or are we on the side of consumers?

615,topic-id,882,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  House Resolution 382 will ultimately drive down healthcare costs and make care more affordable to millions of Americans across the country.  In 2017, we have had a conversation in America about how health insurance costs have drastically increased in the past 7 years. We need to fix our health insurance market, a task that House Members and Senators have been working hard on for the past few months, but if we are truly going to address out-of-control health insurance costs, we need to start looking at the cost of supplying care itself. That is where H.1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, plays a vital role. H.1215 focuses on lowering the cost of care by placing checks and balances on the excessive and frivolous lawsuits faced by doctors and other healthcare providers.  A GAO report found that rising litigation awards are responsible for skyrocketing medical professional liability premiums. Unfortunately, these premium costs are passed on to the patient and, in many cases, are passed on to American taxpayers. The reforms in H.1215 will make care more affordable for patients and will improve access to care, especially for rural  Over time, unending and excessive lawsuits have limited the amount of doctors nationwide, particularly in States that have not instituted their own reforms. With a string of frivolous lawsuits levied against our medical community, many Americans who would become doctors and practice in certain parts of the Nation simply decided against it.  The reforms in H.1215 will especially help rural and underserved urban communities, where quality healthcare can be difficult to access. Incentivizing medical professionals to serve in communities that might otherwise be overlooked should be one goal of our healthcare reform efforts.  I know the healthcare challenges faced by so many in eastern Colorado, where access to quality care is sometimes limited. We need doctors who are willing to invest in these communities, but we need to empower these doctors by freeing them of frivolous and excessive lawsuits.  Beyond just access to care, the growth of frivolous malpractice lawsuits has led to a change in the way care is provided. Many providers are forced to practice defensive medicine. In doing so, doctors order unnecessary, excessive diagnostics not because the patient needs them, but because the doctor attempts to avoid a frivolous lawsuit. The practice of defensive medicine increases costs for the patient without providing any discernible benefit.  The legislation we are considering is key to increasing the affordability of care and the access to care for all  This bill is supported by the American Hospital Association and the American Academy of Family The American Medical Association has also voiced their support.  But let me be clear: The bill before the House today does not limit access to justice for legitimately wronged or injured patients. It does not hamper a wronged patient from recovering damages for their injuries.  The bill simply imposes a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, a provision that has worked well in California, where this legislation has already been successfully implemented and modeled for decades. But there is no cap on economic damages that a patient may incur in a malpractice situation, and the bill's cap does not preempt any State law that otherwise caps any form of damages at amounts either higher or lower than the cap in H.1215.  The legislation also limits the contingency fees that lawyers can charge when bringing a malpractice case on behalf of a client. In other words, we don't want to incentivize lawyers to push forward with illegitimate cases. We want patients who have been wronged to have access to a fair trial, where they walk home with the winnings in their own pocket, not their lawyer's.  H.1215 builds on the successes of medical malpractice reforms in States like California and In these States, similar laws have increased access to affordable medical care. They have created an environment where doctors can focus on helping patients rather than spending time in endless litigation and dealing with threats from the trial bar.  The legislation before us, while creating a uniform national playing field, protects State laws by allowing flexible reforms to be used at the discretion of State courts will still hear medical lawsuits as always.  The reforms at hand today deal with care that was provided or subsidized by the Federal Government, including through a tax benefit.[[Page H5194]]  We must pass this legislation for the American taxpayer. The taxpayer doesn't deserve to have their hard-earned dollars simply end up in the pockets of trial lawyers due to frivolous lawsuits. That is why H.1215 is a critically needed reform.  Unlimited and opportunistic lawsuits help no one except trial lawyers. Consequently, our doctors have to increase their costs and practice expensive defensive medicine, costing patients and taxpayers. And when our physicians are impacted, so are we.  Trial lawyers too often stand between patients and their doctors. With the looming threat of excessive, unending lawsuits, healthcare providers have to worry more about the trial lawyer at their door than the patient in their office. H.1215 places important limits on these lawsuits so that the truly wronged are compensated without enriching trial lawyers at the same time.  I reserve the balance of my time.

644,topic-id,391,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate my friend's newfound sense of bipartisanship. The Affordable Care Act was passed without a single Republican vote in the House, without a single Republican vote in the Senate, and without any concern of Republican thoughts about how healthcare should be run in this country. Now that the Affordable Care Act is, in fact, failing; now that we have over 90 counties in America that have zero health insurers to choose from in the individual market; and now that we see the Affordable Care Act in a death spiral, all of a sudden, we are concerned about the bipartisanship and how to fix the problem.  We have heard zero amendments in the past 6 years to the Affordable Care Act that would have, in fact, improved the Affordable Care Act from the other side of the aisle while they had the President in the White House, and now, all of a sudden, we are looking for bipartisanship and solutions.

364,topic-id,2531,"Mr.President, I come to speak against the Congressional Review Act resolution to overrun an important rule that has been put in place to protect the American taxpayer and to protect the health of American citizens.  For almost 100 years, the Federal Government has regulated undue waste in oil and gas fields. The story of oil and gas waste is as old as the story of oil and gas.  Early oil gushers, like Spindletop in Texas, revealed two things about oil as an emerging source of energy: First, there was a huge amount of it. Second, without rules in place, it could be easily wasted. That is why, way back in 1915, Attorney General Thomas Gregory issued a report to the public about this issue. Gregory wrote that the law at the time allowed oil companies to ``occupy and operate any number of tracts of public oil land without restraint upon the quantities of oil produced or the methods of production and[[Page S2854]]without rendering to the . . . government anything in return.'' One can imagine that concern. Gregory went on to point out that ``the incentives to speculative occupation, negligent and wasteful operation, and excess production become obvious.''  Some of my colleagues who are not on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee may not be familiar with the law Congress passed after Attorney General Gregory put his finger on the waste problem. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 established our modern leasing program for oil and natural gas. More than anything else, the leasing act enshrined the principle that the public should benefit from mineral production on public lands. This seems like a no-brainer today, but it took over a decade of debate to pass the leasing act.  One of the main parts of the leasing act was a requirement to avoid wasting oil and gas. There are many environmental reasons to avoid wasting this resource, but let's be clear: It was dollar signs that led to the waste provision. Overproduction would glut the market and damage the oil reserves, and wasted oil provided no return to the owners--the taxpayers.  The leasing act is still the law, and the law says that oil and gas operators must ``use all reasonable precautions to prevent waste of oil or gas developed in the land.'' The law says that Federal leases must include ``a provision that such rules . . . for the prevention of undue waste as may be prescribed by [the] Secretary shall be observed.'' The BLM's methane rule is entirely in keeping with that history. The rule says that the outdated 1979 version of this rule needed to be updated.  The rule was put in place before the fracking took place that revolutionized the industry, before the shale plays opened, and before infrared imaging became commonplace. What has not changed since 1920 is that oil and gas companies cannot waste public resources on public lands.  When equipment is leaky or old, oil and gas producers vent natural gas directly to the sky. If they do capture the gas but have nowhere to send it, the gas just gets burned on site. This venting and flaring causes a big problem. This photograph shows that actual problem happening.  I am sure there are many citizens across the United States who have witnessed this and have been concerned about what pollutants might be entering the atmosphere. The hazardous health impacts of this are tremendous--benzene, which causes cancer--and I will talk more about that in a minute.  The amount of venting that is happening is enough gas to supply 6.2 million American households for a year. According to more recent research, even higher estimates are coming in. That is enough gas to supply every home in the interior West--Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico--with gas left over for the Every home. The amount of gas we waste every single year on Federal lands would be enough to supply Tennessee forever, and there could be some left over for West  On Federal lands, operators have more than doubled how much gas they have flared and wasted between 2009 and today, and that is the practice we are trying to stop. Under the old 1979 rule, operators had to apply to BLM every time they wanted to vent or flare. In practice, BLM, because they did not have a new rule in place, basically just had a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer. In 2014, the Bureau of Land Management received 25 times more applications to vent or flare than in 2005.  What was happening was that we as a Federal Government were failing in our responding and updating the act to make sure producers were living up to the intent of that earlier law, so government watchdogs got on the issue and started calling for a solution.  The Government Accountability Office and the Interior Department's inspector general concluded that the Bureau of Land Management needed to change these rules. The Government Accountability Office concluded in 2010 that about 40 percent of wasted natural gas on Federal leases could be economically captured with existing technology.  Some States had already taken action into their own hands. In Colorado, the State passed a strong venting and leak detection regulation, which really became the model for the national Bureau of Land Management, and oil and gas production has since increased.  There was a notion that in making sure that waste was not promulgated--that it somehow was going to slow down the industry, but it has been just the opposite. In fact, some of my colleagues and some ranchers and others in these areas have talked about how the United States should lead the way on new technology to stop the leakage and to prevent these flarings as a way for the industry to show technology leadership.  Also, in North Dakota, a Republican administration passed flaring restrictions after years of there being uncontrolled flaring in the States took action, and various watchdog groups and investigators here in Washington said the Bureau of Land Management needed to act. The BLM finally acted, and its final rule is similar to the North Dakota approach. So States have already been leaders on this methane issue. But this patchwork of State rules is not what we need; we need a Federal baseline.  It is bad enough that wasted natural gas will never have an economic use. Making the issue worse is that every cubic foot that is vented or flared is another cubic foot we have to produce somewhere else. What does that mean for our wallets? Research by ICF International shows that $330 million of natural gas is wasted intentionally on Federal lands every year. Over time, the public is losing billions of dollars. Over a decade, the lost royalties that have been calculated by the Government Accountability Office on wasted gas will add up to $230 million. While the final amount, of course, depends on the price of natural gas, we cannot afford to give up this revenue.  A vote for disapproving the resolution will let the oil and gas industry roll back the clock to 1979. This resolution lets people continue avoiding giving the taxpayers their fair share. It is another example of special interests trumping the public interest.  Even worse than the taxpayer issue, though, is that wasted natural gas harms public health. That is why those States took action. One of the most prevailing problems on this issue is in the Four Corners States, and my colleague from New Mexico will be talking about this shortly.  When one looks at the entire United States on a map that shows the amount of waste of flaring, one can see all of this yellow coloring in the Midwest--in Ohio--and in other States, but one can see the hotspot in the Four Corners area. The Four Corners States have tried to take action--places like Colorado and New Mexico, with, obviously, Arizona and Utah being affected--because wasted natural gas basically releases a volatile organic compound. It creates ozone and smog. It also can make people sick. This pollution worsens asthma, emphysema, and increases the risk of premature death. It releases toxins, like benzene, that cause cancer. And the methane, the main constituent of the natural gas, is 25 times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.  That is why a recent analysis by the Clean Air Task Force found that over 9 million people are exposed to these dangerous levels of air pollution from oil and gas production. That is why my colleague Senator Bennet of Colorado has been such an outspoken advocate of keeping this rule in place. It is because that corner of Colorado has faced so many impacts that they want to make sure their citizens are protected.  With the rolling back of this Federal rule, basically what one would be saying is that it is OK to continue this level of pollution--an anathema to what the people of Colorado have been asking for.  Oil and gas pollution can make rural areas seem like the middle of a city. A few years ago, NASA scientists discovered a massive cloud of methane over the Four Corners region. This is the highest concentration of methane in the After aerial surveys, NASA found that over half of the methane is from natural gas equipment, including tanks, wells, pipelines, and processing plants. The ozone pollution in the Four Corners is almost as bad on some days as in the city of Los Angeles--a city with 300 times as many people.[[Page S2855]]  As bad as methane waste is on Federal land, this rule only targets 10 percent of that wasted by the oil and gas industry because we are targeting Federal land. It only affects a small minority of the oil and gas production. Ninety-five percent of that production is in other areas. But this rule is important to put in place because we cannot ignore the impacts on pollution, and we cannot ignore the costs to our Federal lands.  The Bureau of Land Management compared the costs and benefits of this rule without factoring in the reductions in ozone, particulate matter, or smog, and the BLM ignored the value of reducing carcinogens. We know that this particular conservative analysis shows a net benefit of between $46 million and $204 million each year. This makes economic sense to implement.  Under the very obsolete 1979 regulation that the methane rule replaces, oil and gas operators had to apply to the BLM whenever they wanted to vent or flare natural gas. The old rules also had no specific equipment requirements in place.  As I said earlier, the world has changed dramatically since 1979 when it comes to oil and gas production. The new rule takes commonsense approaches to stepping up our attempts to reduce this waste and prohibit the venting, except in emergencies and in some circumstances. They estimate that it will cut the venting by 35 percent. It also sets capture targets for flaring, allowing operators flexibility on how to meet those targets. The BLM estimates they will reduce flaring by 49 percent.  The rule requires operators to inspect their wells and their equipment. People may have heard unbelievable stories from California about a huge methane leakage that caused unbelievable amounts of damage. We know that we want the best equipment, that we want the best detection, and that we want a strong rule in place to stop wasting this natural gas, give the taxpayers a fair deal, and protect the American people from harmful levels of pollution. That is why we want this rule to stay in place.  With America's increased natural gas production, now is not the time to take a very solid rule off the books--a rule that protects the American people. The technology to conduct these inspections already exists. Infrared imaging and other technology has been sold commercially for decades. What we are really saying is that people just do not want to spend the money to implement them.  Fourth, the rule requires operators to replace leaky equipment, like the pneumatic controllers and pumps, and it is trying to make sure that we eliminate the methane waste.  So the final rule is in step with what the Government Accountability Office told us 7 years ago--that about 40 percent of the waste can be captured economically. BLM took those best practices and State examples, as I mentioned, including North Dakota and Colorado, and implemented a new rule.  It includes Colorado's venting and inspection and retrofitting requirements, and regulation 7. It includes North Dakota's capture targets for flared gas in it, and it includes Wyoming's venting and inspection requirements in the Upper Green River  Not only did the Bureau of Land Management adopt the best practices of States, but it also included a variance provision in the final rule. Any State or Tribe with equally effective regulation in place can minimize their methane waste and can apply for a variance from the Department of the There is a lot of flexibility there, I would say, for States that are trying to lead the way. But based on this careful approach, the final rule and its benefits are estimated, as I said earlier, to be $204 million a year.  So the public in these States that are most affected certainly want this rule. As more Americans understand the level of natural gas production and the wasteful venting that continues to take place, they want this rule in place as well.  Passing the resolution just after a few hours of debate and trying to undermine this rule would go against the 330,000 public comments that were collected during the process of establishing this rule. So we certainly don't want to overturn what was a very long and elaborate process to put this very important rule in place.  Proposing more waste is not going to solve our economic challenges. Proposing more pollution is not a solution. We know that in the most recent annual poll by Colorado College, western voters said that 81 percent of them supported making sure that the Bureau of Land Management had strong methane rules. My colleagues appear not to understand how much the public wants to get this implemented. I hope my colleagues will continue to support the effort to turn down the Congressional Review Act resolution and instead keep this very, very important public health and economic taxpayer solution on the books.  As Mark Boling, an executive with Southwestern Energy, a major natural gas producer, said, this resolution and trying to turn back the rule is ``a huge mistake.'' He pointed out that it could have ``unintended consequences for oil and gas technology.''  So I want to make sure this rule stays in place. Let's keep a strong rule on the books, as I said, for the health of the American people and to make sure that taxpayers get a fair deal with these companies that are producing on Federal lands.

From healthcare to law enforcement, we are working to tackle this crisis from all angles.  Drug courts play an important role in that fight.

It appeared as though she had a normal life. She was a cheerleader, participated in school, and all the time she was getting deeper and crawling deeper into a drug-addicted hole.  After she faced the criminal justice system, she became committed to getting off drugs and getting clean the very first night she spent in jail, and she has been clean ever since. She went through the drug court system, and, basically, it has saved her life. But that is not the end of the story for She has a bright future ahead of her, and she has moved forward.  She was in town for the annual conference of the National Association of Drug Court She has committed her life to helping people like her who have had this situation and who have been at the bottom of the pit of hopelessness, bad health, and bad decisionmaking. She is committed to helping her fellow West Virginians crawl out of that pit, like she did, and become productive individuals. This is the world's largest conference on treatment courts and criminal justice reform.  Back home in Logan, Chelsea is the program director at Appalachian Health She just got her master's degree. One of the things that struck me is that, even in a management position, she continues to counsel and treat a full load of patients, and she told me she will always do so.  Chelsea's story is an example of the progress that can be made by fully committing to fighting the drug epidemic. There are victories and programs that work. Drug court is not the only one, but it is one in the spectrum of solutions.  I am committed to the fight and to working with all of our colleagues who are speaking out today.

I have tried to understand what was going through the President's mind at the time he dismissed Mr.It is clear that he had memorandums written by the Department of Justice that were released at the time, but there is also a clear indication that President Trump had been considering this decision for over a week and that after he had reached the decision to fire Mr.Comey, he needed grounds from the Department of Justice and that that information was supplied to Mr.Trump for his decisionmaking. This was Mr.Trump's decision.  At the time he dismissed Mr.Comey, President Trump's associates had been involved in the investigation being done by the Department of This is a criminal investigation that is being done by the Department of Justice because of Russia's interference that involved Mr.Trump's associates in the U.election system. We do not know where that investigation is going--we do not--but we do know now that the President of the United States has compromised the ability of that investigation by firing Mr.That should not happen in American politics. No one is above the law.  The timing of Mr.Comey's firing is extremely suspicious. If the President were really concerned about the FBI Director's conduct in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, why didn't the President fire Director Comey when he took the oath of office in January? It just does not add up. No one is above the law.[[Page S2863]]  According to news reports, President Trump was also upset over the amount of media coverage that the FBI Director and the investigations were attracting, and the White House asked DOJ officials to come up with reasons.  It is clear to me that the decision to fire Mr.Comey was a personal decision that was reached by President Trump and that it was known by him at the time that it would compromise the investigation that is being done by the Department of  I have been approached by others in their saying that Mr.Comey was not popular with Democrats or Republicans and that he had done things during his term as Director that had upset a lot of us, which is true, but the Director of the FBI has a 10-year term for a reason--a term that is longer than the two terms of the President of the United This is not a partisan position. The FBI is not required to be popular with either Democrats or What he is required to do is to uphold the law of the land for all Americans, and no one is above the law. That is what we expect from the Director of the  President Trump has compromised the integrity and independence of the At this point, what can we do? I would suggest, with regard to the criminal investigation that is being done by the Department of Justice, that there is only one course of action that will maintain the credibility of that investigation, which is that it is incumbent upon the Department of Justice to name, as soon as possible, a special prosecutor to take over that role.  If that is not done, in my view, it will be difficult to have the confidence of the American people that that investigation is not being directed by those who were supposed to be the subject of that investigation.  I think it would also compromise the nomination process of the next Director of the If we do not have a special counsel named, then there will be so much focus on how that next Director will handle this investigation that we really will not have attention paid to the other responsibilities and talents of that individual to be able to handle the FBI's broad jurisdiction.  If that is not resolved--the investigation and the appointment of a special prosecutor--it is difficult to see how we are going to have a truly bipartisan process for maintaining support for the  I urge the Deputy Attorney General to name, as soon as possible, a respected person as an independent prosecutor to take over this investigation.  There are deeper concerns than just the President of the United States' hampering a criminal investigation in which associates of his are involved because it also involves a country that is not a friend to the United All of this was triggered by Russia's involvement in our democratic election system. We know that Russia was directly engaged in trying to compromise our election system by calling into question the confidence of our system and trying to tilt the scales in favor of one of our candidates. Russia made contact with Americans in order to further its game at bringing down our democratic system of government.  This is not unique to the United Russia has used similar tactics in other elections of democratic countries. In the Montenegro election, we saw that Montenegrins were voting on their government's accession into NATO and that Russia exported individuals into that country to try to disrupt that election. They were not successful, but they tried. Just recently, in the French election, we saw how Russia got directly involved in trying to help one of the candidates who it believed would help pull France away from the EU and create a vacuum for Russia's influence, but the French voters turned that down. It was not successful, but that does not mean Russia will not continue to try to bring down democratic systems of government.  Mr.Trump's casual and consistent dismissal of the facts, as laid out by the entire Intelligence Committee, about Russia's engagement in the United States should set off alarm bells. It cannot be business as usual. Yet, today, President Trump and Secretary Tillerson met with Foreign Minister Today of all days, they decided to meet like nothing has happened, but a lot has happened. Did we see any indication that the purpose of that meeting was to raise our strong objections to Russia's interference in our election system or Russia's compromising Americans to try to help in regard to its campaign against our free election system or Russia's engagement and encroachment into other countries? Did we really hear a commitment by the President of the United States that we would not tolerate that type of behavior by Russia? Business as usual. The President wants to establish a friendlier relationship with  Russia has not just tried to bring down free elections systems; they have invaded other countries. We know about the active campaign in Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea, the Russian presence in Moldova and I met with the Prime Minister of Georgia with Senator Wicker earlier today, and he can tell you firsthand about how their country is trying to deal with the Russian presence in their sovereign country.  We all know about Russia's engagement in other parts of the world. Their engagement in Syria is bringing about serious challenges to trying to resolve the crisis in that country. The Russian Government supporting the Assad regime, war crime activities targeting humanitarian convoys, targeting hospitals, the use of chemical weapons--all of that is facilitated by That is well known, but it might be not as well known that Russia is ambitious in going into many more parts of the world. Russia is now engaged in We have had one of our longest wars ever in Afghanistan and our commitment to the people of Afghanistan to have a democratic government. So Russia is now engaged with the Taliban, trying to upset our ability to bring all of the parties together in unity in the government.  That, to me, is totally counter to history. We know about Russia's presence in Does anyone believe Russia is really sincere in maintaining peace in that country?  Then we see Russia's fingerprints in Yemen, trying to get a naval base on the Yemeni coast, showing no concern for the humanitarian crisis that has been created in that country. We see Russia's presence in Libya, supporting General Haftar, who has committed his own human rights violations and war crimes and has disrupted the Government of National Accord, which is our best chance for peace in  We see Russia's presence in Nicaragua, sending troops and equipment to that country and now building a major compound that many believe is being built to spy on the U.compound. That is  So to President Trump: It is not business as usual with There is a reason we need an independent commission to investigate what Russia was doing in the United States because Russia is trying to create space where they can expand their influence, and expanding their influence is for values that are just the opposite of ours--a corrupt government, no respect for human rights, no respect for democratic institutions, and opposition to a free press. That is what Russia is trying to expand. We know that in their involvement in the United States, they are trying to find a way to expand that opportunity.  So it is for all of those reasons it cannot be business as usual, and when the President of the United States interferes with a criminal investigation that was precipitated by Russia's engagement in the United States, every American should be alarmed. Every American should be asking what we can do to make sure we have an independent review so we can take steps to protect our national security.  It is not acceptable for the Senate to say business as usual. We need to come together and facilitate the independent review of potential criminal involvement of Americans in facilitating the Russians and what they were doing, and we need to have an independent review of all of what Russia was doing in this country so we can take the necessary steps to protect our national security.

Delaware was part of the pilot project, and the report contains the recommendation for this map change.  This map change can occur only through an act of  CBRA is a map-based law enacted in 1982 recognizing that certain actions and programs of the Federal Government subsidize and encourage development on coastal barriers.

The CBRA units are depicted on a set of maps that is maintained by the Secretary of the Interior through the U.Fish and Wildlife  While CBRA does not prohibit or regulate development, it removes the Federal incentives to build on these undeveloped, unstable and environmentally sensitive areas.

487,topic-id,607,"Mr.President, I am pleased to join my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, in sponsoring the School Food Modernization Act to assist schools in providing healthier meals to students throughout the country.  School meals play a vital role in the lives of our young people. More than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program every school day and more than 14 million eat school breakfasts, with participation rising steadily in Maine and nationwide. In Maine, 48 percent of children qualify for free or reduced-price meals based on household income.  Moreover, the food served at schools affects children's health and well-being. Many children consume up to half their daily caloric intake at school and some get their most nutritious meal of the day at school instead of at home. At the same time, too many of our children are at risk of serious disease, which may have a lifelong effect on their health as they grow to adulthood.  In response to these health concerns, our schools have stepped up. For example, in the New Sweden Consolidated School in Aroostook County, Maine, food service manager Melanie Lagasse prepares meals from scratch instead of opening cans or pushing a defrost button. The school's 64 students, aged preschool to 8th grade, have grown to relish the chicken stew, baked fish, and meatloaf that she makes fresh.  Many schools, however, lack the right tools for preparing meals rich in fresh ingredients. Schools built decades ago often lack the equipment and infrastructure necessary to do more than reheat and serve one or two meal options each day.  To serve healthier meals, 99 percent of Maine school districts need to acquire at least one piece of equipment and almost 50 percent of districts need kitchen infrastructure upgrades. The median equipment need per school alone is $45,000. Making the required changes to infrastructure is even more costly, with 41 percent of schools needing more physical space, 22 percent more electrical capacity, 21 percent more plumbing capacity, and 19 percent more ventilation.  It is estimated that $58.8 million would be necessary just in Maine for the equipment and infrastructure upgrades needed to serve healthy meals to all of our students. That far exceeds the $89,000 in grants that the U.Department of Agriculture awarded Maine last fiscal year. Maine is not alone. In a recent survey of school nutrition directors, the most frequently cited financial concern was equipment costs, ranking higher than even labor and food costs.  The School Food Modernization Act seeks to help food service personnel offer a wide variety of nutritious and appealing meals and snacks to all students. First, the bill would establish a loan guarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new equipment to prepare and serve healthier meals. Second, it would provide targeted grant assistance to provide the seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or to purchase high-quality equipment such as commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves. Finally, to aid school food service personnel in running successful, healthy programs, the legislation would authorize USDA to provide support on a competitive basis to highly qualified third-party trainers to develop and administer training and technical assistance, including online programs  Senator Heitkamp and I appreciate that provisions of this legislation were incorporated into the Child Nutrition Reauthorization legislation that was passed out of the Agriculture Committee last We encourage our colleagues to continue to support school kitchen equipment needs as the reauthorization process continues.  Mr.President, if our school children are going to be able to learn and compete, they need to be healthy and their minds and bodies fully nourished. This bill would help us achieve that goal.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgS3688.txt,2121,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,21.0,June

392,topic-id,2009,"Mr.President, I was listening with interest to our friend and colleague from Minnesota talk about the Russia investigation. I agree with her 100 percent that it is our responsibility to get to the bottom of what exactly happened with respect to Russian involvement in our elections, much as they got involved in the elections in France, using the combined process commonly known as active measures. Active measures are a combination of cyber espionage, propaganda, and a use of social media through paid trolls who can then actually try to raise the visibility of some of this propaganda such that it then becomes part of the mainstream media and becomes accepted as part of the debate in democratic societies.  I believe we share a bipartisan and universal commitment to get to the bottom of what happened in our last election.  I would note that there are two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who actually serve as members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is actively involved in a rigorous bipartisan investigation. That would be myself and Senator Feinstein, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who is also the former chair of the Senate Intelligence  Senator Feinstein has said recently that there is no evidence of collusion between the administration and I think she would share with me a commitment not to stop there but to find out where the facts take us. Indeed, thanks to Chairman Burr and thanks to Vice Chairman Warner, our bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee has unprecedented access to raw intelligence, from the National Security Agency, the CIA, and from all sources of the intelligence community. We have access to some of the most sensitive intelligence gathered by the U.I think that is due to the credit and leadership of Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Warner that our committee has remained bipartisan and we are leaving no stone unturned to get to the bottom of what exactly happened.  So I know people are concerned, and I share that concern. We need to come up with a program of countermeasures to deal with this because the Russian Government has been amping up their game for some time now, and now they are operating at certainly dangerous levels when it comes to trying to interfere in our most basic democratic institutions, like our elections.  I would say, as far as the Department of Justice is concerned, that Rod Rosenstein was confirmed by this body by a vote of 94 to 6. That is probably the only Trump nomination so far since he has been President that has enjoyed such broad bipartisan support. It is because of his distinguished record, most recently as the U.attorney in  I remember hearing from our Senators from Maryland, for example, Democrats who were praising Rod Rosenstein and saying he was exactly the kind of person we needed in this sensitive job as Deputy Attorney  But now our colleagues seem to forget their very own conviction and vote on Rod Rosenstein, and now they say that he can't be fair, that he has somehow an appearance of a conflict of interest, making it necessary to appoint a special counsel, which, by the way, also then reports to the leadership at the Department of  I think we ought to give Mr.Rosenstein a chance to demonstrate that he is capable of leading that investigation at the Department of Justice, understanding that our role here in the Congress is not to pursue a criminal investigation and case. That is the job of the Department of Our job, in parallel fashion, is for oversight reasons and to let the American people and ourselves know exactly what happened. That is why the investigation of the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is so important, in addition to the hearings we are having in the Judiciary Committee, on which the Senator from Minnesota and I happen to serve as well.  So we do need to get to the bottom of what happened, and I am confident we will. It is our duty, and we will get the job done.                         Healthcare Legislation  On another topic, Mr.President, last week our colleagues in the House took the first necessary step to deliver on our campaign promises for the last three elections to repeal and replace Why is that important? Well, because of the impact of ObamaCare on premiums and deductibles for many people, millions of people, literally, are now being priced out of the insurance market, and their insurance, even though they have the policy, is really unavailable to them because they have, for example, such high deductibles. We know insurance companies continue to pull out of the marketplace, and people are reduced to little or no choices when it comes to where to buy their insurance, because, frankly, ObamaCare was oversold and underdelivered.  The President said: If you like your policy, you can keep it. Well, that proved to be false. He said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Well, that didn't turn out to be true, either. He said that a family of four would save an average of $2,500 on their premiums, and that didn't prove to be true, either.  So like most command and control from Washington, DC--notwithstanding, perhaps, the aspirations of our colleagues across the aisle to deliver affordable healthcare to the American people--it simply failed to do so, and it is in serious distress--even a meltdown.  So we would invite our colleagues across the aisle--our Democrat friends--to join with us to help rescue the American people from this failure of the Affordable Care  The House passed a bill last week--the American Health Care It is not a perfect bill. I dare say the Senate is going to take up a bill of its own, and we will try to work with our House colleagues to try to get legislation to the President and signed into law that will rescue the American people and will finally deliver on our promise of more affordable premiums, better access, and real choice.  But it is really not enough to just stand back and criticize those who are actually trying to rescue those who are in harm's way as a result of the failures of That, so far, is what our friends across the aisle are doing. They are not lifting a finger to help the people hurt today by We would challenge them to get involved and to work with us.  Many of our colleagues have come to the floor and talked about stories they have heard from their constituents back in their States and the harm that the Affordable Care Act has caused. Premiums have skyrocketed. Millions have been kicked off their healthcare plans. The economy is saddled with billions of dollars in new regulations. Employers are laying people off or not hiring new people because, frankly, they don't want to suffer the additional financial burdens of  Instead of having more access to more health insurance options, Texans--the people I represent--have less of both.  The bottom line is ObamaCare has failed, and it is up to us to provide some relief to the people who are being hurt by the failure of We invite our colleagues to work with us to do that.  Since the creation of ObamaCare, I have been hearing regularly from my constituents back home in Texas how they need relief from the healthcare law and they need it now. Every letter, phone call, or conversation produces similar themes. One of my constituents, for example, is a woman who was paying about $300 a month for her health insurance, but under a span of just a few months, that premium skyrocketed to $800--$300 to $800. I don't know many people who can withstand that kind of increase in their expenses for healthcare.[[Page S2871]]  She wrote to me and said: ``This has to stop--and quality, flexible plans need to return for individuals.''  I agree with her.  Another wrote in to say that before ObamaCare her daughter was getting what she considered to be adequate healthcare insurance for about $190 a month with just a $500 deductible. Now that has gone up to a payment of almost $400 a month--roughly, doubled--with a deductible of more than $6,000. What are people supposed to do with a deductible of $6,000 which says you have to pay $6,000 before your insurance pays a penny? It is essentially no good to most hard-working, middle class families.  So ObamaCare does not equal healthcare that is affordable or better for It is simply not working.  In fact, in Texas, if you have a gross income of about $24,000 a year, under ObamaCare, you could end up spending about 30 percent of your total income on healthcare costs alone--30 percent of your gross income on healthcare and related costs.  Fortunately, thanks to the passage of the American Healthcare Act, or the AHCA, which passed the House last week, we have the beginning of a path forward to provide a lifeline to those people who are simply priced out of the market today--the 30 million people who don't have insurance--and those who simply can't use the health coverage they have under  So I look forward to working with our Senate colleagues--hopefully, all of our Senate colleagues, if they are willing--to help improve the House bill and to get it passed in this Chamber and signed by the  This is not something we can do without the support of every Republican Senator, but my hope is that we would do this with the help of more than just  Our goal to repeal and replace this bill has been, of course, no secret.  We need legislation that will reform With the American Healthcare Act, we have the first major healthcare entitlement reform in a generation, without eliminating anybody who is currently covered by Medicaid today.  We also need to do away with ObamaCare's job-killing taxes, like the individual and the employer mandate. I remember, in Tyler, TX, a few years ago, meeting with a single mom who worked in a restaurant who told me that her hours had been cut from 40 hours a week to less than 30 hours a week because her employer didn't want to pay the employer mandate and so basically had to cut people from full-time work back to part-time work. So what did she do? She had to get another job as a single mom, working in a restaurant in Tyler, That is the sort of unintended consequence of  Then there is the medical device tax--something the Presiding Officer has led on--which is a tax on innovation. This isn't even a tax on income. It is a tax on gross receipts. I have had some medical device companies from my State tell me they have had to move their operations to Costa Rica in order to avoid the medical device tax, which has crippled their ability to innovate and invest in their business. Then there is the tax on investments and the tax on prescription drugs. Middle-income Americans and our job creators need and will get massive tax relief when we repeal and replace  So that is what 52 Members of the Republican conference are working on and what we would like to work on with our colleagues across the aisle, if they are willing to help. We welcome their ideas. Actually, a bipartisan solution would be preferable to one done strictly along party lines. But all Members of the Republican conference are at the table working on that today. There is no denying that our country can't afford another one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare. The American people need relief from the unworkable, unsustainable system that President Obama promised--or delivered, which is very different from what he promised. I am confident that we can get there by working together to responsibly provide relief and, in doing so, empower individuals to deliver more options and competition and responsibly help those who need care to have more access to it.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-10-pt1-PgS2853.txt,1692,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,10.0,June

521,topic-id,2148,"Mr.President, I want to spend a little bit of time today talking about how badly ObamaCare is failing the American people and how my Republican colleagues and I are working to repeal and replace it with healthcare that works. I wish I could say that Democrats and Republicans were working together to replace it with healthcare that works. Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues have taken a walk on this particular topic and, apparently, are not interested in participating.  Even though 30 million Americans remain uninsured under ObamaCare, the individual market--where people buy their health insurance if they do not have employer-provided coverage or government-provided coverage--is in a death spiral. This was confirmed by a study by the Department of Health and Human It was also the subject of a Wall Street Journal article today that makes the point that average premiums in the individual market have increased 105 percent since 2013 in the 39 States in which the ObamaCare exchanges are federally run. This translates into $3,000 more out-of-pocket for middle-class, hard-working families--a 105-percent increase in premiums since 2013.  I dare anybody to say ObamaCare is working as it was intended. All one has to do is look back to President Obama's very words, when he said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; if you like your health insurance policy, you can keep that. He also said: Oh, by the way, we are going to save you money too. A family of four will save $2,500 a year. Contrast that to the $3,000-a-year increase since 2013 in the individual market--a 105-percent increase.  As I said earlier, this week the Department of Health and Human Services released a report that underscores the negative impact ObamaCare is having on families across the country. The report highlights the incredible increase in annual premium prices since ObamaCare took effect, and I mention that in the aggregate.  Let's look at places like In Texas, the average monthly premium jumped from $222 in 2013 to $404--about an 82-percent increase. If you are a young person buying health insurance, a young family or anybody, for that matter, spending $222 a month and it jumps 82 percent, to $404, that is a big bite out of your disposable income. That is pretty bad, there is no question about it, but Texas wasn't close to being the hardest hit.  For example, in Wisconsin, premiums have almost doubled. In Montana, they have gone up 133 percent. In some States, the premiums have actually tripled. As I said, the average individual premium has more than doubled in the 39 States using healthcare.gov--an increase of 105 percent since 2013.  That is not the only problem with This year, one in three counties across the United States have just one insurer on the ObamaCare exchange. In other words, ObamaCare has gotten it so wrong that the risk pools are mainly people who are older and who need healthcare more, and many younger people--young, healthy people who are important in the risk pool to help bring premiums down for everybody--are simply taking a walk. This isn't the mark of a healthcare law that is working for the American people or helping our country grow healthier. It is the mark of a law that is actually hurting families by giving them fewer options at a higher cost and failing to deliver on any promises. We wonder why people are cynical about their own government. Well, it is because of promises made and promises not kept, and ObamaCare--I have said it before and I will say it again--is one of the biggest examples of consumer fraud I have ever seen in my lifetime.  We are talking about real-world consequences here. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to talk about how many people would be potentially hurt by repealing and replacing Of course, that is purely speculative. They are making it harder because they refuse to participate in this process, but we are determined to make sure we bring premiums down and make health insurance more affordable for those who want to buy it.  Let me talk about concrete examples of people terribly affected by the ObamaCare healthcare law. One of my constituents wrote me a few weeks ago and said she and her husband got their insurance from her husband's job, but since ObamaCare came into effect, their premiums have tripled, and she estimates their deductibles have doubled. What is also frightening is that her prescriptions have skyrocketed too. As an example, an inhaler that previously cost her $35 now costs almost 10 times that amount--well over $300.  Given the outrageous costs, this Texan decided to see if she could get a better deal on the exchange since her insurance costs kept going up and up and up. She said the deductible she would have gotten was $6,000 a year. Add that to higher premiums, and she said ObamaCare was too high to even think about changing to.  ObamaCare has had so many negative ripple effects throughout our entire economy. It restricted the number of hours people can work because of the employer mandate. It raised taxes, depressing economic activity and growth--things like the medical device tax. The medical device industry is one of the most innovative, lifesaving industries in our country and literally in the world. Yet ObamaCare imposed a medical device tax and chased those jobs and the innovation that goes along with them offshore. I remember one of my constituents from Dallas, TX, said they had a location in Costa Rica, and as long as the medical device tax applied to things they did in Texas and in the United States, they were going to take their business and build it in Costa Rica for one reason and one reason alone; that is, to avoid this crushing tax.  The result has not been good for the economy, and it has not been good for healthcare. Many folks can't find any reasonable insurance that will actually pay for what they want. They can't afford what insurance they do have, and they feel hopeless and helpless as the rates keep climbing.  Because I know these stories apply not only in Alaska or in Texas, they apply all across the country, one would think we would have Senators on both sides of the aisle clamoring and working together to try to come up with some solutions, but, once again, it is stony silence from our colleagues across the aisle.  As my constituent rightly pointed out, so much of their income is now going toward premiums and other healthcare costs, she said she and her husband feel like they are actually being robbed. That is why we believe, on this side of the aisle--I wish I could say on both sides of the aisle but certainly on this side of the aisle--that we need to find a solution that works for our country.  So here is an open invitation to any of our colleagues in either House of Congress: Please come work with us, not for our benefit, not for any political gain or advantage but because it is the right thing to do. That is why we get elected. That is why we serve, not to engage in petty politics but to actually do things that help our constituents.  This isn't just a red-State problem. I pointed that out earlier when I referenced Wisconsin and This is a problem that confronts our entire country.  So we are going to continue to keep working on a bill that repeals this ObamaCare disaster and replaces it with patient-centered, accessible healthcare that make sense for the[[Page S3169]]American people. I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle come around to join us because we do intend to get this done.  I just want to read a couple of other excerpts from this Wall Street Journal editorial today. They talk a little bit about how to read the CBO report. The Congressional Budget Office, as the Presiding Officer knows, really has the final word on interpreting, from an official standpoint, what the impact of proposed legislation would be, but I have to say this is far from the holy writ.  Here is a good example. In this article, they point out ObamaCare coverage estimates--CBO estimates for ObamaCare coverage by year in millions of enrollees. For example, in 2013, they projected that 7 million enrollees would enroll in ObamaCare, and it was 6 million. That is not too far off, but let's look at 2015. In 2015, they said 13 million would enroll, and 11 million enrolled. Again, that is ballpark, but then we go to 2016. They predicted that 21 million people would enroll in Do you know how many enrolled? Twelve million. They missed it by almost 50 percent. That is not close. Then, in 2017, they projected it would be 15 million, and it was 10 million.  I say that not to disparage the Congressional Budget Office because I know they are doing the best they can, but it is hard to predict the future, and it is also hard to predict how markets will work and how people will respond to the incentive of more choices and lower costs.  This is not a red-State or a blue-State issue because, as I mentioned, in Missouri alone HHS has said that premiums have increased 145 percent. So wouldn't we think we would have both Senators from Missouri on the floor working with us to try to solve the problem? I know Senator Blunt is working with us to try to solve the problem, but we would benefit from having a bipartisan effort to address the problem.  They also point out that there are other things the CBO report talks about which is significant, particularly in terms of getting our economy growing again. They said, for example, that the House bill cut taxes by $992 billion, spending by $1.1 trillion, and reduced the deficit by $119 billion. Now, I know that is not the primary effort here when it comes to healthcare, but if we want to get our economy growing again, if we want to make it possible for more people to buy healthcare coverage at a price they can afford, it helps if they have a job, and it helps if the economy is growing.  Here is the thing that, to me, is perhaps the most cynical argument by the critics of what we are trying to do in repealing and replacing Despite the fact that there are 30 million people uninsured now--hardly a success, hardly the gold standard for providing access to healthcare coverage--the Congressional Budget Office points out what I think is pretty obvious. If you take the gun away from people's heads and you don't force them to buy a product they really don't want, fewer people are actually going to buy it because it doesn't suit their needs, and it is not available at a price they can afford. As the Wall Street Journal points out, without the threat of government to buy insurance or else pay a penalty, some people will conclude that ObamaCare coverage isn't worth the price, even with the subsidies.  Sometimes I wish we would have honest and open debates about the problems that confront our country, and certainly healthcare is something near and dear to all of our hearts. Too often I feel as though we are ships passing in the night or reverting to our talking points rather than having an open and honest discussion. This is an area where we can benefit from an open and honest discussion and an acknowledgment that the status quo is unsustainable.  If Hillary Clinton were President of the United States today, we would be revisiting ObamaCare because the individual market is, as I described earlier, failing. It is failing. I am confident our colleagues across the aisle would be eager to try to step forward to address that, but because the candidate they did not choose won the Presidency, then they are in full-blown resistance, not offering to lift even a finger to try to help us solve this problem, and it is a shame, but it is not too late.  We invite them again to join us as we repeal and replace ObamaCare, providing people with more choices at a price they can afford, not because we are going to hold a gun to their head and say you are going to have to buy a product you don't want, at a price you can't afford, we are going to give people the freedom to choose. That is not a bad thing. That is a good thing. That is what America is all about--not having government force you to make decisions that you don't view are in your own economic self-interests.

525,topic-id,814,"Madam President, I would like to take this time to discuss a critical public health crisis affecting constituents in Illinois and all across the country. Each day, 46 people die from overdose of prescription painkillers in the United In Illinois, that number is only growing.  Overdose deaths in Illinois from opioids rose about 275 percent from 2008 to 2014. There are an estimated 460,000 nonmedical prescription opioid users in Illinois alone. A major portion of the total number of drug-poisoning deaths between 2013 and 2015 were a result of opioid and prescription drug abuse. Over 4,000 people died as a result of opioids and prescription drugs, and 2,000 people died due to heroin. Illinois also had the third fastest rising death rates from synthetic opioids in the Nation, with overdoses rising by 120 percent from 2014 to 2015. Unfortunately, Illinois is third from the bottom for treatment of substance abuse because of lack of funding and resources to healthcare providers and law enforcement partners in the  These numbers are alarming, but I would like to share a story behind those numbers--a face. Laura Fry is a mother whose family has experienced the worst of the opioid epidemic. Her son, Alexander, is 29 years old and in remission from heroin use disorder.  Alexander was just a normal kid growing up in Wauconda, He had his entire life ahead of him. Then, when he was 17, he had a snowboarding accident and was taken to the emergency room after he lost consciousness. That is when doctors found a mass on his cerebellum and he had to undergo major brain surgery. It was after this surgery that Alexander became addicted to morphine, and his drug abuse began.  When Alexander graduated from high school, he began working at a hospital, where he was able to steal drugs to fuel his abuse. Over time, his drug abuse spiraled out of control. He was fired from his job for stealing narcotics and was arrested for possession of heroin. But because this was his first offense, he was given a very strict 2-year probation. Over the next 4 months, he tested positive for heroin several times, and then he simply disappeared. Laura did not know where her son was or whether he was even alive for 10 months. Finally, he was arrested and taken into custody.  In Lake County, IL, we thankfully have a criminal justice system that recognizes addiction is a disease. The court gave Alexander the opportunity to continue his probation, and he was allowed to perform hundreds of hours of community service and to attend an intensive outpatient program.  In the spring of last year, Laura and her son Alexander appeared in court for the last time. Alexander is now a volunteer for Live4Lali, a substance abuse program in He attends community outreach events, shares stories, and offers trainings in naloxone use--a lifesaving drug that reverses opioid overdoses. He has gone from being a user to someone who is transforming lives.  Alexander's story is a reminder that Congress must focus on enhancing recovery efforts, and we are beginning to take steps in the right direction. For example, I was a proud supporter of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, also known as CARA, when I served in the CARA, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, establishes, supports, and strengthens a number of programs to fight the opioid crisis in communities. It provides opportunities for rehabilitation, like the outpatient program Alexander attended, and expands access to drugs like naloxone, which are saving lives on the frontlines of this epidemic.  I applaud these efforts, but I have serious concerns about the majority's commitment to actually funding these essential programs to rehabilitate our fellow Americans who are suffering from opioid addiction because, while we can all agree that CARA's intent was to transform our opioid crisis, the bill failed to provide any actual funds to enact these effective programs.  I, along with many of my colleagues, have asked for CARA to be fully funded and to provide additional funding to the drug courts and veteran treatment courts, which essentially reduced crime, saved taxpayer dollars, and saved the lives of more than 1.25 million civilians and veterans. In addition, we must also make sure families have access to medicine that can save lives during an overdose by calling on manufacturers to offer naloxone to rein in the costs.  I share this story because the turmoil that the Fry family faced is not unique. Millions of Americans are experiencing the impact of opioid abuse, and many of these American stories have much more tragic endings. We can and must do more for these families.  I ask that we take the time, consider the story of Alexander and his family, and step up and do the right thing. Let's fund CARA fully.  Thank you. I yield the floor.

516,topic-id,1854,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Judge Amul Thapar to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of  Judge Thapar is President Trump's first nominee to serve on a Federal appeals court. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered this nomination and no Democrat voted for it.  Judge Thapar is on the list of 21 candidates that the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation have selected for President Donald Trump to choose from when filling Supreme Court vacancies.  Judge Thapar is well known to the Federalist He was a member of that organization prior to becoming a district court judge, and since he became a judge he has spoken at Federalist Society events 17 times.  Some of my colleagues on the Republican side are like Captain Renault in Casablanca, who claimed he was ``shocked, shocked'' to find out there was gambling going on in Rick's  They are shocked that anyone could be concerned about the Federalist Society, which they claim is just a simple debate club. Far from it--consider the following background.  The organization was founded in 1982 by students at two law schools, Yale and the University of Chicago, under the faculty supervision of Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia, who just happen to be the two most prominent conservative legal scholars of their generation.  According to a recent article about the Federalist Society by Jeffrey Toobin: ``within just a few years, the group was embraced and funded by a number of powerful, wealthy conservative organizations, which eventually included foundations associated with John Olin, Lynde and Harry Bradley, Richard Scaife, and the Koch Brothers.''  The Federalist Society's website includes the group's purpose statement. It claims that the legal profession is: ``currently strongly dominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which advocates a centralized and uniform society.''  The statement describes the Federalist Society as a group of conservatives and libertarians calling for: ``reordering priorities within the legal system,'' to fit their principles. Does that sound like the mission statement of a nonpartisan debate society?  How has the Federalist Society gone about this reordering? It's been largely the work of Mr.Leonard Leo, the longtime executive vice president of the Federalist Society who is currently serving as an advisor to the Trump White  Mr.Leo has been credited with being a driving force behind the Supreme Court nominations of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel That is one-third of the current Supreme Court that he has helped put in place.  Mr.Leo recently gave a speech where he said: ``I've seen that comment about the third of the Supreme I prefer controlling interests. But we haven't quite been able to launch a hostile takeover yet.''  Mr.Leo went on to advocate for radical change, saying: ``I would love to see the courts unrecognizable.'' He has said of the judicial confirmation process: ``it's like war.''  In an unprecedented move, President Trump outsourced the selection of Supreme Court candidates to Mr.Leo, the Federalist Society, and the right-wing Heritage He publicly thanked these special interest groups for putting together his list of 21 Supreme Court candidates, and Mr.Leo was the first person to call Neil Gorsuch about his nomination.  As Jeffrey Toobin wrote, Leonard Leo: ``knew how to play the game--how to find a nominee who met Trump's ideological requirements as well as his own, while observing the proprieties expected for judicial nominees.''  Mr.Leo told Mr.Toobin that it was: ``easy'' to find these nominees because: ``when you've been working in this vineyard for twenty-five years you know everybody.''  That brings us back to Judge  Leonard Leo, and the big money right-wing interests that fund the Federalist Society, feel that they know Judge Thapar well enough to include him on the list of 21.  They have had plenty of opportunity to get a sense of his views, as Judge Thapar had been a member of the Federalist Society and has frequently spoken at their events.  At his hearing and in my questions to him, I sought reassurance from Judge Thapar that he would be independent from this right-wing group and President  His answers did not provide that reassurance.  For example, I asked Judge Thapar whether he agreed or disagreed with the Federalist Society's purpose statement. He ducked the question, saying he didn't know what the Federalist Society meant by the statement.  I asked him if he thought it was appropriate for the President to delegate his Supreme Court selection process to the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation, since this creates incentive for judges not to contravene the views of those organizations and their big-money donors. He ducked again, saying he would not opine on this because he claimed it was a ``political question.''  In the aftermath of Citizens United, special interest groups pour dark money into campaigns in support of Republican judicial nominees like Judge I asked Judge Thapar if he would discourage secret donations in support of his nomination.  After all, if we don't know who is secretly donating in support of his nomination, how will we know when Judge Thapar needs to recuse himself because one of those donors has an interest in a case he is considering?  He dodged that question too, saying he wasn't aware of any donations about his nomination. Of course, he wouldn't be aware of secret donations--that's the problem.  I also asked him about the original understanding of the Constitution's Emoluments He said he could not discuss it because there is pending litigation on the matter.  That is curious, because I thought the Federalist Society's view was that the original meaning of constitutional provisions was immutable and unchanging. If the meaning of the Constitution doesn't change, why do Federalist Society nominees decline to tell us this meaning when there is litigation underway affecting President Trump?  I asked Judge Thapar about his decision in Winter v. This was a major campaign finance decision in which he applied strict scrutiny to invalidate a ban on judges making political contributions. A unanimous Sixth Circuit panel reversed his ruling.[[Page S3162]]  A group of 24 campaign finance reform organizations sent a letter saying: ``Judge Thapar embraced the troubling `money is speech' paradigm in a radical way that goes beyond Supreme Court doctrine.'' These groups oppose his confirmation, and I ask unanimous consent to have their letter printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Given Judge Thapar's evasiveness on questions about his views, I am left to judge him on his record, such as his troubling decision in the Winter case, and the fact that the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation handpicked him for their judicial wish list.  I need more reassurance than that to support a nominee for a lifetime appointment on the Federal court of appeals. I will oppose his nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     May 17, 2017.     Senate Judiciary Committee,     Washington,       Dear Senators: We the undersigned organizations write to      oppose the confirmation of Judge Amul Thapar to the United      States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit due to his      troubling record on the issue of money in politics.       We are deeply concerned with the power of wealthy campaign      donors in American politics, and specifically with the      aggressive role the U.courts have played in undermining      our democracy by elevating the voices of a wealthy few over      the views of everyday       Much of the problem can be attributed to four decades of      flawed Supreme Court rulings. These decisions have twisted      the meaning of the First Amendment and prevented our elected      representatives and the people from enacting reasonable      protections against big money. In fact, nearly half of the      money in the 2016 federal elections--more than $3 billion--     can be directly tied to a few of the Court's most damaging      rulings.       What concerns us about Judge Thapar's record is that he has      gone beyond the Supreme Court's directives in his antagonism      towards basic rules designed to ensure we have a government      that is of, by and for the people.       In Winter v. Wolnitzek, 186 F.3d 673 (E.2016), Judge      Thapar struck down a prohibition on judges making political      contributions by applying strict scrutiny to this      contribution ban, in spite of the fact that the Supreme Court      has been clear that contribution limits and bans are to be      reviewed under a lower form of scrutiny. The Sixth Circuit      overturned Judge Thapar's ruling on this point and reinstated      the contribution ban.       Further, Judge Thapar embraced the troubling ``money is      speech'' paradigm in a radical way that goes beyond Supreme      Court doctrine, writing ``there is simply no difference      between `saying' that one supports an organization by using      words and `saying' that one supports an organization by      donating money.''       Whitehouse pointed out in Judge Thapar's Senate      Judiciary Committee hearing that ``those of us who are in      politics know that that is a false statement, that it is      indeed a preposterous statement factually because money has a      completely different effect than speech once it enters the      political arena.''       The Supreme Court itself does not treat financial      contributions as being equal to actual speech. Rather, the      Court considers contributing to a campaign a form of      association or attenuated speech since the contributor does      not control the content of the communication resulting from      the contribution.       If Judge Thapar had his way, wealthy donors and special      interests could be able to give unlimited sums of money      directly to candidates for office. Thapar would make it even      harder than it is now for everyday people to be heard and      affect who runs for office, who wins elections, and what      issues get attention; and easier for powerful politicians to      make secret wink and nod deals with their richest      contributors.       Judge Thapar's responses to questioning on the subject      during his hearing and in subsequent ``questions for the      record'' did nothing to allay our concerns. In response to      Klobuchar's questions about why he applied strict      scrutiny to the contribution ban, for example, Judge Thapar      struggled to explain why he assumed (without analysis) that      the same standard should apply to contributions as to      solicitations.       The role of big money in politics became a central issue in      the debate over Justice Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the      U.Supreme Court because the public cares deeply about this      issue. To ensure that all voices are heard, not just those of      powerful corporations and wealthy donors, it is essential      that we confirm judges and justices who understand that the      Constitution gives we the people the power to protect our      democracy from big money.       Unfortunately, Judge Amul Thapar does not appear to see our      pro-democracy Constitution as the vast majority of Americans      do--and for this reason we urge you to oppose his      confirmation to the U.Court of Appeals for the Sixth                Sincerely,       American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Democratic      Action, Center for American Progress, Center for Emergent      Diplomacy, Class Action, Communications Workers of America,      CODEPINK, Democracy Spring, Demos, End Citizens United, Every      Voice, Free Speech for People, Friends of the Earth, Just      Foreign Policy, Maplight, MAYDAY, National Association of      Social Workers, Participatory Politics Foundation, People for      the American Way, PeopleNow.org, Reverb Press, Small Planet      Institute, United for Democracy, Voices for                         Healthcare Legislation  ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3161-3.txt,326,WOUNDED OFFICERS RECOVERY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,June

What he said today I have never heard him say before. He said it was the fault of the Democrats for refusing to work with the Republicans to change the Affordable Care I had not heard that before.  I find it an interesting suggestion because what happened after the House of Representatives passed a measure 3 weeks ago to change the healthcare system in America, the issue then came to the Senate but did not go through the regular order of business.  It is my understanding--and has been reported widely in the press--that Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, assembled a group of 13 Republican Senators who have been meeting in private over the last 3 weeks to discuss an alternative to the healthcare bill that passed in the House of There are no Democrats in that room. None have been invited. Incidentally, there are no women in that room from the Republican side--13 male Senators meeting in private.

They are meeting privately to come up with something, and I don't know what it might be, but I have an idea of how we can achieve a bipartisan real effort when it comes to healthcare in  I would suggest we create a committee in the I have a name for it, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions I suggest we have 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on that committee. I suggest they sit down, take the bill sent by the House, and improve it, make it better. Now, this suggestion is such a good one that the committee already exists.  It is under the chairmanship of Lamar Alexander--whom I respect personally very much--and the ranking member, Patty Murray of the State of Washington, a I know, having spoken to Senator Murray, she is ready to roll up her sleeves and go to work to write a revision to the healthcare bill, the healthcare system in  There have been no hearings, none, on the measure passed by the House of So when the Republican leader says he wishes the Democrats would join in the effort, this committee is ready and willing to work. I am sure, if he picked up the phone and called Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, they could get to work on doing a much better job than what the House of Representatives did.  Why am I so critical of the House of Representatives? Not because of the traditional rivalry between the Chambers, but because yesterday the Congressional Budget Office took a look at the bill that passed the U.House of Representatives 3 weeks ago by two votes. It was all Republicans voting for it. It passed by two. A number of Republicans refused to support it. It had no support from the Democratic side.  It was an unusual bill because it went out of the regular order of business. The regular order of business suggests that when you are going to do something that might have an impact--a large impact--on America, you should go to an agency that is a nonpartisan, expert in the field, that will analyze your bill and tell you what impact it will have. Most of us think we have pretty good ideas for making America a better place to live and good ideas for legislation.  Luckily, we have something called the Congressional Budget Office, which sometimes brings us back down to Earth and says: It might not work exactly as you thought it would work. Traditionally, bills--significant bills that affect a lot of Americans and families and things important like healthcare--they are submitted to the[[Page S3163]]Congressional Budget Office so they can analyze them and decide the impact they will have.  Well, 3 weeks ago, Speaker Paul Ryan and Republicans in the House said something I had not heard before in my service in They said: We are not going to wait for this analysis. We are going to vote on this bill even before the Congressional Budget Office has a chance to analyze its impact. Remember, we are talking about changing the healthcare system in America, and that literally impacts every single It is one-sixth of our Nation's economy. You would think, before anyone was bold enough to suggest they wanted to change the system, they would at least send their proposal to the Congressional Budget Office for an analysis. The Republicans in the House failed to do so, refused to do so, passed the measure by two votes, and sent it to the  So, yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office completed its analysis. Now that we have an analysis of what is known as TrumpCare or the Republican healthcare approach, it is pretty clear why they did not want the Congressional Budget Office to take a look at it. This is what the Congressional Budget Office reported publicly last night: Next year, under the Republican proposal for healthcare reform, 14 million Americans will lose their health insurance. Over the next 10 years, 23 million Americans will lose their health insurance.  Do you remember when we started this conversation? The goal was to make sure we changed the laws in America so more Americans would have the protection of health insurance. Just the opposite occurs if the Republican plan goes forward. The second thing we were looking for is a goal in healthcare reform to reduce the growth, the rate of growth, in health insurance premiums.  Every one of us knows what that is all about. Health insurance premiums have been going up way too high for way too long. The Republicans have been critical of the current system, saying the cost of health insurance is going up too fast. So they put in their reform proposal which passed the House of  Here is what the Congressional Budget Office had to say about the Republican approach: Next year, premiums for health insurance will increase by 20 percent in the individual market. That is the market where we have seen this dramatic growth in costs already, and the Republican plan makes it worse.  The third thing we find is this argument by the Republicans that somehow the current healthcare system in America, the Affordable Care Act, is in a death spiral. Listen to what the Congressional Budget Office said about the health insurance market in America today. The CBO affirms that under current law, marketplaces--health insurance marketplaces--are stable.  However, under the Republican repeal bill, one out of every six Americans will be living in parts of this country where the individual market would become unstable as a result of the Republican bill. So instead of stabilizing the market and ending the so-called death spiral, the Republican bill makes it worse.  It turns out that when you take a close look at this so-called death spiral, you find the Republicans have their hands around the throats of the healthcare system of America choking it and claiming this patient is not looking good, If they would stop their efforts to sabotage the current system and work to improve it and make it stronger, then we could save health insurance for a lot of Americans and bring stability to the system.  The Republican bill at its heart is not about a healthcare bill, though, it is about tax cuts. The Republican proposal for healthcare reform starts with eliminating almost $900 billion in taxes paid by the wealthiest people in By taking $900 billion out of the healthcare system, they are unable to keep health insurance alive for so many The Republican approach eliminates $834 billion in the Federal Medicaid What is the Federal Medicaid Program? Let me give you three examples of what it is.  In Illinois today, half of the babies who are born are paid for--their medical care is paid for by the Medicaid system: prenatal care for mom so the baby is healthy, the delivery of the baby, and postnatal care afterward. These are lower income individuals. Half of them are paid for by Medicaid today, but that is not the most expensive part of  The most expensive part of Medicaid is for your mom and dad and your grandmother and grandfather who are in a nursing home and have no savings left. All they have is Social Security, Medicare, and That is the most expensive part of Those who are disabled living in my State, in Alabama, in New York, and other States--disabled people and low-income people need medical care and they rely on  So when the Republican healthcare reform and repeal cuts $800 billion-plus out of Medicaid, it is at the expense of the groups I just mentioned: babies and moms, elderly people in nursing homes, and the disabled. Those are the ones who will see a cutback in medical services so we can give a $900 billion tax cut to the wealthiest people in  I know the Democratic leader is here. I want to yield the floor when he arrives, but I want to close by telling a story. Yesterday, I had three moms and a dad who brought their children to a press conference. It was a great press conference, if I may say so. These kids stole the show, as they should. Each one of them--each one of them had a compelling story about having survived a terrible illness. Many of them were cancer victims.  Moms told stories. One mom said: I was changing my little girl, and I noticed a lump in her abdomen. It turned out to be a neuroblastoma cancer tumor. It was removed. My little girl spent weeks, months in the hospital, and she is still going back.  Each one of them told a story. As you looked at these kids, smiling and happy and bouncing around, you thought to yourself: Thank goodness. Thank goodness for America, with its great medical care, and thank goodness these families had health insurance--because they were there concerned about what the Republicans are doing when it comes to preexisting conditions.  Because these kids have survived cancer, they are risky from an insurance viewpoint. We decided 6 years ago to put an end to that worry for these families. You cannot discriminate against a person or a family in America based on a preexisting condition--thank goodness--because one out of three of us have a preexisting condition. The Republican approach takes away that protection and says Governors can ask for a waiver so health insurance in their State can discriminate against people with preexisting conditions.  So three moms and a dad came yesterday and said: Please stop this Republican plan. What will our families do? Our kids have preexisting conditions. We cannot afford to see our premiums go through the roof because the Republicans withdraw this protection.  That is the real-life consequence of this debate. This is not just about a lot of politicians on Capitol Hill blowing hot air. It is about families--real families with real kids and real challenges and whether they are going to have real protection when they need it.  The Congressional Budget Office yesterday came out with a report and said the measure that passed the House, the Republican measure, is a disaster for families across We have to stop it. We have to do everything in our power to do it. I might say to my friend from New York, the Democratic leader, that when the Republican leader came to the floor this morning and said: Why won't the Democrats join us in repairing the Affordable Care Act? I say to the Republican leader: Open the door of that room where you have 13 male Republican Senators sitting down and debating the future of healthcare. Open the door, open the windows, and let's have an honest, open, bipartisan conversation not about repealing our healthcare system but making it stronger, protecting the very families who showed up yesterday at a press conference and whom I am going to remember for a long time.  I yield the floor.                   Recognition of the Minority Leader  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

387,topic-id,1552,"Mr.President, I rise to address President Trump's stunning dismissal of FBI Director Comey yesterday evening. We know the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. We know the Russians did so in order to undermine confidence in our democracy. We know the Russians carried out this attack with the goal of benefiting the campaign of Donald Trump, whom the Kremlin preferred to see win the election. These facts have been confirmed by our intelligence agencies.  What we don't fully yet understand is all of the reasons why, all the reasons why the Russians favored Donald Trump and whether associates of the President or members of his campaign assisted in the Russian operations to sway the election in his favor.  These questions are the subject of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation, an investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and, until last night, an investigation led by James  As former Director Comey recently testified to the House Intelligence Committee, ``[T]he FBI, as part of [its] counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election--and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia.''  The timing of Director Comey's dismissal raises serious questions, and President Trump's decision to abruptly fire the man leading an investigation that could implicate the Trump administration should shock the conscience of every American who believes that no man or woman is above the law and who has faith in the fair and impartial pursuit of justice.  The White House attempted to preemptively dispel any suspicion by announcing that President Trump fired the Director ``based on the clear recommendations'' of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod The White House released several documents to back up that claim: a letter from President Trump to Director Comey, firing him; a letter from Attorney General Sessions to President Trump, recommending that Comey be fired; and a memo written by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, which cited the Director's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation as damaging the FBI's reputation and credibility. These documents create more questions than they answer.  First, the letter from President Trump to Director Comey firing him. President Trump, ever eager to put distance between the Russian inquiry and himself, wrote: ``While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.''  Again, we know the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russians in their efforts to influence the election. Director Comey confirmed that before he was fired. Whether President Trump is personally under investigation by the Bureau or whether investigators are merely scrutinizing his advisers and associates, the President's clumsy attempt at misdirection does little more than remind us of the many unanswered questions about his and his people's connections to  Second, Attorney General Sessions' letter to President The Attorney General writes that based on his review of Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein's memo, which cites the Director's handling of the Clinton email investigation, that Attorney General Sessions has concluded that the FBI requires new leadership and a fresh start. Attorney General Sessions recommended that Director Comey be fired.  Attorney General Sessions should not have had any involvement in this decision at all. On March 2, the Attorney General called a press conference to announce: ``I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States.''  The reason Attorney General Sessions made that announcement was because news reports revealed he had provided misleading testimony in response to a question that I asked during his confirmation hearing; that Attorney General Sessions had falsely stated: ``I did not have communications with the Russians.'' In fact, he did meet with the Russian Ambassador during the campaign twice.  Having provided misleading testimony under oath about a matter that could potentially be the subject of a criminal investigation by the FBI, Attorney General Sessions was forced to recuse himself.  I find it deeply troubling that Attorney General Jeff Sessions--who misled the Judiciary Committee about his own communications with the Russian Ambassador and who pledged to recuse himself from this investigation as a result--betrayed that pledge by involving[[Page S2866]]himself in the decision to fire the Director of the FBI, who was leading the investigation into Russia's interference in our elections, including whether members of President Trump's campaign were involved in that interference. Attorney General Sessions was a member of that campaign, and he misled the committee on whether he had met with the Russians, and he did that under oath. That is why he recused himself, and yet he inserted himself in this firing.  Finally, there is Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein's memo, which asserts that Director Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation caused the public to lose confidence in the Director Comey spoke publicly about the Clinton email investigation twice, in July and October of last year.  Setting aside whether Director Comey's decision to discuss the investigation was unorthodox or broke with Justice Department and FBI protocols, his actions were well known to both President Trump and Attorney General Sessions, and both of them celebrated his actions at the time. After Director Comey wrote to Congress on October 28, informing us that the FBI had discovered additional emails and would therefore reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton, then-Candidate Trump praised his decision. He said: ``What [Comey] did was the right thing,'' and ``It took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had.''  Appearing on FOX Business Network, then-Senator Sessions said that Director Comey ``had an absolute duty, in my opinion, 11 days [before an election] or not, to come forward with the new information that he has and let the American people know that, too.''  If President Trump or Attorney General Sessions truly objected to the way that Director Comey conducted the investigation into Secretary Clinton's emails, I suspect they would have said so at the time rather than heap praise upon him. But their previous statements lauding Director Comey's handling of the Clinton email probe cast suspicion on the extent to which they relied on the Deputy Attorney General's purported rationale.  Further, and this is important, if Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein were truly concerned that Director Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation had damaged the reputation of the Bureau, then why not wait for the conclusion of an investigation by the very respected DOJ inspector general into Comey's decision during the election--his decisions--an investigation that had been underway since January?  The shifting positions of President Trump and Attorney General Sessions lead me to believe something else is going on here, that this is not about Hillary Clinton's emails but about turning the page on In fact, last night, a White House spokesman said so. Appearing on FOX News, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked how Director Comey's firing would affect the Russia investigation. She replied:       When are they going to let that go? It's been going on for      nearly a year. Frankly, it's getting kind of absurd. There's      nothing there. It's time to move on. Frankly, it's time to      focus on the things the American people care about.  The American people care about whether a hostile foreign government influenced our election. They care about whether advisers and associates of the President helped that foreign government do that.  The events that have occurred over the past 24 hours are deeply, deeply unsettling. As my Republican colleague Senator Flake said last night:       I've spent the last several hours trying to find an      acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just      can't do it.  And I can't either. In my view, the timing and the circumstances surrounding Director Comey's dismissal are very suspicious. For example, just this morning, it was reported that Director Comey recently asked the Justice Department to provide additional resources for the Russian investigation--a request that purportedly he made personally to Deputy Attorney General This raises grave concerns about the Trump Justice Department's ability to conduct a full, fair, and impartial investigation. In order to address these concerns, Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should come to the Senate and explain their involvement to all of the Senators in this body.  In the wake of what I believe was a politically motivated decision to remove Director Comey, I no longer have confidence that the Department of Justice can fulfill its obligation to resolve this matter impartially. The situation now calls very clearly for the appointment of a special prosecutor to oversee the investigation into whether associates of the Trump organization or former members of the Trump campaign had knowledge of or participated in the Russian attack on our democracy.  I join my colleagues' calls for an independent inquiry so the American people can have confidence that the individuals who conduct this investigation will follow the facts no matter where they lead.

I want to talk about the concern I have of one of the President's priorities in the 2018 fiscal year budget. That priority is Yucca  Specifically, the President included $120 million in his budget for the Department of Energy to restart licensing activities for the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste  As a proponent and author of the legislation called No Budget, No Pay Act, which would restore regular order to the budget and appropriations process, I am pleased to see the President did submit to Congress a detailed budget proposal.  As a small government, fiscal conservative, I hoped that this new administration would focus on budget priorities that would reduce duplicative spending and streamline programs in order to save taxpayer dollars. You can imagine my disappointment that they, instead, decided to prioritize funding to restart licensing activities for a failed proposal.  Over the past few weeks, I have outlined on the Senate floor some of the issues with Yucca Mountain, whether it is the crippling effect it would have on Nevada's economy or the public safety issues associated with transportation of this nuclear waste. I will continue to come to the floor to educate my colleagues on the many issues associated with Yucca Mountain, because, plain and simple, it is not a viable option for the long-term storage of our Nation's nuclear waste. Instead of throwing more taxpayer dollars into a failed proposal, we should be working on a real long-term solution rooted in consent-based siting.  You have heard me raise the question that many Nevadans be thinking: Why should a State with no nuclear powerplants of its own be forced, against its will, to house all of the Nation's nuclear waste?  I stand by the Department of Energy's 2010 decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain program, and I stand by its 2015 recommendation for a consent-based siting.  Yucca Mountain is dead. Let me take you through what it would take to put this failed program back on life support. Prior to the suspension of the program in 2010, the Federal Government had spent close to $15 billion on Yucca  Now, I recognize that some of my colleagues might say: Well, the government has already spent this much on the government repository; shouldn't we complete it?  First of all, let me say that restarting the program would need $2 billion more just to complete the licensing process--$1.66 billion for the Department of Energy and $330 million for the Nuclear Regulatory  After 3 to 5 years spent on licensing, there could well be another 5 years in legal challenges, and there is no certainty that Yucca Mountain would ever be built.  Second, even if Yucca Mountain were to go forward, it would be an expensive repository project. The Department of Energy's best estimate is that another $82 billion--let me repeat that; another $82 billion--would be needed to license, litigate, build, operate, decommission, and eventually close Yucca On top of the money that has already been spent, that adds up to more than $96 billion for what is called the total system life cycle cost.  That leads to my third point. We need to reevaluate the whole nuclear waste cost question. There is a business case to be made against Yucca The Department of Energy's own estimates for Yucca Mountain say that the nuclear waste fund will only pay about 80 percent of the total life cycle costs, or about $77 billion. The remaining $19 billion would have to come from an annual appropriations voted by this That means more money for this project paid by taxpayers.  But it does not have to be that way. In 2012, the Department of Energy did its own cost assessment and concluded that all other costs, like transportation, being equal, walking away from Yucca Mountain and starting with a new repository site in a deep salt bed or deep shale formation would actually save between $12 billion and $27 billion over the life of the repository.  Before we spend any more taxpayer dollars on Yucca Mountain, we need to ask the Department of Energy experts to come before us and explain what they learned about repository costs in their previous studies. Beyond that, we need new cost studies on geologic disposal in repositories, studies that include the lessons learned from recent progress with repositories in Europe, and new studies that look at the nuclear waste program overall and incorporate the cost of safe on-site reactors, early removal of spent fuel from shutdown reactors, and consolidated interim storage facilities, as recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear  It is clear that rather than forcing the State of Nevada to accept nuclear waste at a scientifically unsound site, taxpayer dollars would be better spent identifying viable alternatives for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in areas that are willing to house it. Finding alternatives is the commonsense path forward, as well as the fiscally responsible decision.  I urge my colleagues, as we continue the budget appropriations process for this next fiscal year, to conduct oversight over the life-cycle costs of repositories and to focus on further implementing the Department of Energy's consent-based siting process, instead of wasting more taxpayer dollars on a failed proposal.[[Page S3179]]  I stand ready to partner with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this issue, and I am confident that together we can find a solution to this problem once and for all.

385,topic-id,730,"Mr.President, I have a request for the Indians Affairs Committee to meet today at 2:30 p.m.  First, we have a markup in the Indian Affairs The two bills we are marking up are Democrat-sponsored bills. The first one is Senator Tester's bill, from the State of Montana, which would provide support for Native languages. I guess the summary is that it would support the education of Indian children. I believe it relates to Native languages in that educational capacity. So that is one of the bills, Senator Tester's bill.  The other bill we are marking up is Senator Tim Kaine's bill, also a Democrat-sponsored bill. The short narrative I have is this: To extend Federal recognition to the Chickahominy Indian Tribe, the Chicahominy Indian Tribe-Eastern Division, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the Rappahonnock Tribe, the Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Indian  The reason that is significant, that is something that both Senator Kaine and Senator Warner--both Senators from Virginia--have been working on for some time. The reason it is timely is that they have Pocahontas's birthday celebration coming up, which I think is going to be a large celebration in the Commonwealth of They were hoping to have these Tribes recognized before this birthday celebration for It is a timely issue.  Obviously, we can't advance the bill to the Senate floor unless we mark it up. At the request of those two Democratic Senators from the Commonwealth of Virginia, we are scheduled to mark up those bills and get them to the floor and try to do it in a timely way because of the celebration they are trying to get prepared for. Everybody knows the story of Pocahontas and why that would be a big celebration and certainly a big deal in the Commonwealth of  Again, as we debate this on the Senate floor, I think Senator Daines made some strong points, and I would certainly appeal to our colleagues across the aisle to consider what I just described as far as those markups.  In addition to those markups, we also have a hearing on several bills. The first one is a McCain bill, and it is to amend the PROTECT Act to make Indian Tribes eligible for AMBER Alert grants.  Everybody knows what the AMBER Alert Program is and how important that program is to protect our young people when they get abducted. The reason Senator McCain, from Arizona, is bringing this bill forward is because there was an abduction in Arizona, and the AMBER Alert went out late. I[[Page S2865]]think the AMBER Alert went out a day late.  Senator McCain has this PROTECT Act so we can make sure the AMBER Alert is working in Indian Country, and you certainly can understand how important it is that we do that. We have to have a hearing on the bill again so we can advance the bill to the Senate floor for consideration.  The final bill that we would have a hearing on in committee, if we are allowed to meet, is a Murkowski bill, Senator Murkowski from It would provide the conveyance of certain property in this  You have to realize that the witnesses--and I think certainly the good Senator from Hawaii will appreciate this--had to come here from Alaska, which is quite a lengthy trip. When the Senator travels back home to Hawaii, that is a long trip. It is certainly a beautiful place but a long trip to get there. Of course, it is not inexpensive to travel from Alaska to Washington,  Those witnesses will be out their costs to come here if we are not able to have the hearing, and we would have to reschedule it. That certainly creates a cost burden for them, which is certainly unfair and not what they would want to have had happen on the part of their government.  I am putting that in human terms.

We are talking about constituents who have traveled a long way to come here to have the hearing and the markup.  Again, these are issues we should be able to work on in a bipartisan way.

481,topic-id,2313,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Raskin for his leadership in the It has been a great honor to co-chair the CPC Special Order hour here every week on the floor.  Since I have just been elected the first vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, I, unfortunately, won't be continuing to do that. But I am still going to be right here for these Special Order hours, because I do think that they are an important opportunity for Members to talk about issues all at once, and to kind of pick an issue, and then to focus on it.  Obviously, today, we are talking about the testimony from former FBI Director James This was highly anticipated testimony, and I would be willing to guess that a lot more people, perhaps, even watched the testimony than watched the inauguration. But I think we learned a great deal from former Director I appreciate that he was willing to come and testify, and he said some very important things.  In that testimony, Mr.Comey confirmed that President Trump sought to influence the FBI investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia, including that of Michael  While the President had claimed that he did not ask former Director Comey to drop the investigation, Mr.Comey actually testified under oath that Trump's directive was clear, and that this was apparently so off-putting that he began to memorialize their meetings. Every single meeting he had with President Trump, he would have the meeting and then go back to the car and immediately take notes on the meeting, and that is troubling.  That was something that former Director Comey never did with previous administrations. And one of the things that stuck out to me in his testimony is that he had actually asked--he felt so uncomfortable with the interactions that he was having with the President, because I think the American people need to understand, the FBI is built to be an independent organization.  The reason that the term of the FBI Director is 10 years is because it was a signal from Congress that even though the FBI Director does serve at the pleasure of the President--and Mr.Comey was clear about that in his testimony today--the President has the ability to hire and fire the FBI  But the reason Congress signaled through legislation that the term of the FBI Director should be 10 years was because they wanted to send a signal that this body is incredibly important, and the independence of this body is incredibly important.  The fact that Mr.Comey, as FBI Director, felt so uncomfortable about these interactions with the President--nine interactions with the I think he had only two interactions with President Obama during his entire term, and yet, in just the first few months, he had nine interactions with President He actually asked Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not to leave him alone with the  That is really a remarkable, scary thing that he would have to ask for that, and it certainly should have raised some red flags and should have triggered some action from the Attorney General, or the Deputy Attorney It did not. He never received an answer to that.  Mr.Comey also said that he expects the special counsel's investigation to look into the possibility that Trump's actions were an obstruction of justice. He said that this did fall within the investigation scope. So while he didn't directly say that Trump was directly under investigation, he did say that the President's behavior does fall within the investigation's scope.  That, frankly, does nothing to dispel any concerns that are out there amongst the American people, and many of us in Congress, that President Trump's campaign did not collude with  Apparently, he did not seem particularly concerned about whether or not Russia did interfere in the elections but was more interested in whether or not his circle of friends, Michael Flynn, was under threat.  Former Director Comey also confirmed that Michael Flynn is under criminal investigation, and he raised more questions about Attorney General Jeff As I have spoken about on the floor before, Attorney General Sessions should not have been involved in the firing of James Comey in the first place.  He had recused himself from all things related to the investigation into the campaign's ties to Russia because of his involvement with the Trump campaign, and so that was good. We thought that was a very good move that he made to recuse himself, but then he immediately went and was directly involved in the decisionmaking around the person who was leading the investigation, in fact, involved in the decision to fire the person who was leading the investigation.  Mr.Comey also hinted that Jeff Sessions had more contact with the Russians than maybe we even knew about. He could not speak to that in a public setting. He said that is for a classified setting, but, obviously, that raises a lot more questions, and the American people certainly deserve the truth.  One of the biggest takeaways from the testimony was this: President Trump gave many changing reasons as to why former Director Comey was fired. And former Director Comey spoke to this today. He said, at first, it was because it was the handling--it was because of Comey's handling of the Clinton emails. Then it was that he had lost the support of the FBI agents, something that James Comey responded to, and said: ``Those were lies, plain and simple.''  Actually, Mr.Comey spent quite some time really acknowledging the work of the organization, the FBI organization, and the agents, and everything that he has done. I certainly got the impression that he felt very deeply upset by any indication that perhaps it was because his agents didn't want him to be there.  What Mr.Comey pointed to is that eventually the President, in his own words, admitted that he fired James Comey over the Russian investigation, and then, right after that, actually said to the Russians that the pressure has now been taken off now that Comey has been fired. Those are all incredibly disturbing.  And I am sad, Mr.Speaker, that the Republicans--some Republican colleagues, not all, but some--have tried to dismiss the President's actions as ``mistakes made by a new President who is learning how to do his job.'' Speaker Paul Ryan went so far as to say: ``He is new at government. Therefore, I think he is learning as he goes.''  This is just 1 day after the Speaker said that it is obviously--that was his word--not appropriate for the President to ask for Mr.Comey's loyalty. So which one is it, Mr.Speaker? It is unacceptable to excuse the President's actions simply because he is not a career professional, especially when we are talking about something of this magnitude--the magnitude of interference in our election process in the United States of America by a foreign government.  We do not have any information still about all of the ways in which a President of the United States, this President of the United States, may be indebted to some foreign government because of their actions with the election.[[Page H4812]]  It has been repeatedly reported that the President does not sit for briefings, does not read the reports that are provided to him, does not stick to speeches on policies that are written for him, and, frankly, shows very little interest in participating in the administrative responsibilities that most Presidents go through in order to learn what is a very big job.  Yes, the job of the President of the United States is a very big job, and anybody who gets into that job, just as I do in this body as a new Member of Congress, we try to learn the rules. We go to the people who know the most. We ask them to give us briefings. We suck up as much information as we possibly can so that we understand both content and process.  But, unfortunately, this President has not done any of that, and he has made many unforced errors. Frankly, he has put our national security at risk by giving secrets away to Russia, insulting key allies who have now said that they won't share information with us because they don't trust that we are going to be able to keep it secret.  NATO and our allies in the European Union, where I just came back from, everybody around the world is unsure of what leadership, if any, to expect from the United States of  Angela Merkel said it the best when she said: We can't rely on anybody else anymore. And she said: We, as a European Union, have to just come together and rely on ourselves.  And while that is great for the European Union, I am glad that there is something that has happened here that has drawn the European Union together. It is an incredibly important entity for the world and has been doing remarkable work. But what I would hope, Mr.Speaker, is that countries around the world know that the United States is going to continue to take global leadership, is going to continue to demonstrate that global leadership, and, most of all, is going to be trusted to make relationships and respect the rules of those relationships.  The American people are aware that the President's background is not in politics. However, the White House is not ``The Apprentice.'' Had a new employee in The Trump Organization made as many errors as have been made in this administration, he would have been fired a long time ago.  The American people deserve better. And not only do we demand that the President not intervene in any negative way in Director Mueller's investigation--and we are very pleased that Director Mueller has been appointed. I believe that was an incredibly important step that Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took to appoint somebody with the credibility that Mueller has--but we hope that this investigation will continue, because I think it is important for the American people to understand that this is not an independent investigator, or prosecutor. This is special counsel.  So that still means that anything that Director Mueller finds in his findings, his reports, they do get run up the chain of command at the Department of So if you watched yesterday's Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, you might have seen Senator Kamala Harris discuss this and ask Rod Rosenstein if he could assure that there really would be independence, that neither Rosenstein nor Jeff Sessions would get involved in trying to change or influence, in any way, whatever Director Mueller comes up with.  She was not given that assurance yesterday, unfortunately, and so we still don't know. But we have to hope and believe that the President and this administration will preserve the independence of the special counsel and will take all of the findings and the recommendations as to what they are presented and not try to change them.  I really believe, Mr.Speaker, at this point, that while the special counsel is an important step forward, I join my colleague Mr.Raskin and many others in this caucus, in our Democratic Caucus, in calling for a special commission, an independent commission, similar to the 9/11 Commission, filled with citizens--not with Members of Congress but with respected citizens--and people with expertise, as well as those citizens, to actually come together and think not only about the immediate impact of how we get to the bottom of what has happened, but, really, how do we prevent this going forward?  What we are talking about is the sanctity of our democracy; we are talking about whether our elections can be free of influence from other countries; we are talking about if an American citizen casts a vote here in the United States for the President of the United States, that that vote is not being influenced by a foreign government who has hacked our elections, or worked in collusion with a campaign for the President of the United States; and that ultimately, whoever we select, whether it is this President or any President in the future, that that President must be responsible to the American people.  That is what democracy is about. We don't want any President, now or in the future, to ever be in a situation where there is information that can be used against them, where they could be blackmailed, leveraged, or where they are actively colluding with any government outside of this country.  These are our elections. It is what makes this country great. It is why so many people from all around the world look at America with tremendous gratitude, with tremendous respect, even awe for the way in which we have constructed our democracy. That is part of what goes on in this Chamber, and we need to know that the election of the President of this great country is always an election that the American people have faith in, and that democracy is preserved.  Mr.Speaker, I think what James Comey's testimony showed us today is, we got a lot of answers, but we didn't get enough answers. There is still more information that we need to find. There is more information that the Senate Intelligence Committee needs to find. There is more information that the President may have to provide, and there is more information that the American people are going to demand in order to ensure that we get to the bottom of where we are, that we get an independent commission established, and that we allow Director Mueller, in his investigation, to proceed without any interference.  That is the least that we have to be willing to do, and we have to be willing to put country above party as we try to ensure that we understand exactly what has happened. The American people deserve that.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgH4811.txt,99999999999999,1230,2017.0,8.0,June

370,topic-id,2000,"Mr.President, I rise to speak briefly about the American Health Care Act that was passed last week in the House of I thought a lot about this bill over the past few days and over the weekend. I talked to friends, I read about it, and I did as much analysis as I possibly could, given the fact that we don't have a Congressional Budget Office analysis of this complicated and important piece of legislation. I have concluded that it is the most ill-conceived, damaging, and downright cruel piece of legislation that I have ever seen a legislative body pass in my adult life.  It drastically cuts support for Americans' ability to obtain health insurance. In Maine--again, as near as we can tell, because we don't have the final analysis--the preliminary numbers are this. Maine, under the Affordable Care Act, through the payments to individuals and other support, is receiving about $354 million a year coming via the Affordable Care After this bill, it appears that the number is $80 million a year--$364 million to $80 million. That is almost an 80-percent cut. No one can tell me the people of Maine are going to have better healthcare with an 80-percent cut in the funds going to support their ability to do so. It just doesn't make sense.  The way this bill works is, it is a tax on the elderly. Under the Affordable Care Act, there is a rule that policies for older people, 50, 55, 60, cannot exceed three times the rate of policies for younger people. We all know that younger people's policies do in fact cost somewhat less because they tend to be healthier, but the rule was no more than 3 to 1. Under the bill that was passed by the House last week, it is now 5 to 1. That is an elder tax, and Maine happens to be the most elder State in the United If they had taken a blank sheet of paper and said: We want to write a bill to harm the people of Maine, it would have been this bill.  There also is a massive cut to Medicaid--$880 billion--and the sponsors to this bill claim that they are helping the deficit. How are they doing it? By[[Page S2860]]shifting the cost to the States--shift and shaft. Balancing the Federal budget by simply taking costs that are now borne by the Federal Government and passing them off to the States is not responsible fiscal policy.  Why don't we just have the States fund the U.Air Force? That would save us billions of dollars a year--probably $100 billion a year. Shift that to the States--and $880 billion shifted to the  Then there is what I call the figleaf--the preexisting condition provision which talks about the Maine plan, which was a plan that preceded the Affordable Care Act, which did give protection for preexisting conditions, but it was adequately funded. It cost about $64 million a year to fund our preexisting plan. Again, because we don't have the precise figures--but it looks like under this new bill, that $64 million would be $20 million, one-third as much, a two-thirds reduction. It is not a real preexisting condition plan; it is a figleaf. It is to say to people: We are covering preexisting conditions--nonsense, not true.  Of course, the final piece of this bill is a massive tax cut for the top one-tenth of 1 percent of people in this country. They will not even notice it, but the people who lose their healthcare will notice.  Now, under the Affordable Care Act, there is a list of essential benefits which includes mental health and substance abuse. That is a big deal. That allows and assures people to have coverage for these very damaging and dangerous, in the case of substance abuse, conditions. Under this bill that passed in the House, States can waive those provisions and the waiver is very easy. The standards for the waiver are very easy, and if the Federal department doesn't respond in 60 days, the waiver is automatically provided. In those States when they have a waiver, mental health and substance abuse services could be covered under a specialized plan which would be very expensive. By the way, this waiver covers both the individual market and employer-based coverage. How many people will be impacted? We do not know because we do not have an analysis from the Congressional Budget  I want to talk for the remainder of my time about opioids and what this bill would do on that.  We are in the midst of a crisis in Maine and across the country. It is the most serious public health crisis in my adult life. In Maine, with regard to substance abuse and overdose deaths, you can see what has happened in the last 5 years. More than one person a day is dying of an overdose. Across the country, it is four an hour. We have turned ourselves inside out in this country in order to deal with the threat of terrorism, for example, which was entirely appropriate. Yet what if we had a terrorist attack that was killing 37,000 people a year across our country, and we were just sort of going along, business as usual?  I have been working on this issue since I got to the I have been meeting with people throughout Maine--in hospitals and in recovery--and meeting with families and parents and law enforcement. The one thing that comes through loud and clear is that treatment works and that we need it and that we do not have enough available beds in Maine and across the country.  This is a terrible disease, but the most tragic thing of all is when someone finally reaches the point at which he is ready to ask for help and he is told ``Sorry, there is a 3-week wait'' or ``There is a 3-month wait.'' That is when lives are lost and families are destroyed.  Treatment does work. I have met with people for whom it has worked and changed their lives. I have a friend in Portland named Andrew Kiezulas, who I believe is graduating this weekend from the University of Southern He has been through this. He has been to the bottom, and he is now on the mountaintop. He knows treatment works, and it has made a difference in his life. Without it, he would not be where he is today. Justin Reid, another young man from Southern Maine, was in the throes of addiction and escaped. He now runs a sober house and volunteers for a program with his local police department.  Access to treatment is much easier with health insurance and with sufficient Medicaid support. The House bill simply makes it more difficult to access treatment. It penalizes the very people who have taken the hard step to say that this is what they need.  Let me tell you a story. Matt Braun is from Cape Elizabeth, ME, right outside of In 2009 Matt entered treatment for opioid addiction. His parents, who were strong, middle-class, professional people, purchased what they thought was good health insurance for their family. After 5 days of treatment, they received a call that the insurer was not going to pay for any more. We have decided your son only needs 5 days. His parents argued, and the medical staff argued. They finally won. They got 7 days of treatment. Those extra 2 days made a difference.  The insurance company said that it was not going to help, that he was going to be a chronically relapsing, drug-addicted person, so they were going to stop at 7 days. They said he would not make it. His parents did not give up.  Matt stayed in treatment and has been sober ever since 2009. He is successful. He is getting ready to take the He wants to go to medical school. His goal is to approach addiction from the perspective of a health professional and offer care and support to people who are struggling in the way he did.  ``It is frustrating how insurance companies dictate what treatment looks like and what a life is worth,'' said  Getting treatment for substance abuse disorder is not easy, but this bill, the American Health Care Act, which is a misnamed bill--it should be the American Take Away Health Care Act--only makes it worse.  On top of all of this, the administration has recently indicated that it is talking about essentially dismantling the Office of National Drug Control Policy--the highest level to be working on this problem in a coordinated way in the Federal Here we are, in the midst of the most serious drug crisis in the history of this country, and the administration is talking about gutting the very office that is supposed to lead the fight. It would have been as if, in the middle of World War II, we had abolished the Department of It makes no sense. It is moving in absolutely the wrong direction.  By supporting this healthcare bill--or non-healthcare bill--in the House of Representatives, which will drastically cut Medicaid, drastically cut reimbursements for health insurance, drastically limit the availability of coverage for preexisting conditions--by the way, drug addiction could be one--and drastically eliminate the essential benefits provisions of the Affordable Care Act, we are just making it worse.  The Office of National Drug Control Policy has things like the Drug-Free Community Support Program, which administers small grants to small towns. That can make a real difference. Last fall, 18 Maine programs each received $125,000, and the DFC's 2014 national evaluation report said that there was a significant decrease in the 30-day use of prescription drugs for youth in communities with one of these programs.  Prevention is one of the things we need to work on, and it is one of the things we need to understand. Yet talking about this problem is not going to solve it. Treatment is going to solve it. Money for treatment is going to solve it. Beds for treatment are going to solve it. Detox centers are going to solve it. More resources to law enforcement are going to solve it. More resources to the Coast Guard, in order to interdict drug shipments coming into this country, are going to solve it.  There is no single answer, but at the core is commitment. Passing this bill from the House, which drastically undermines all of those elements of treatment and prevention, and then talking about dismantling the office that has led this fight in the entire Federal Government, is beyond comprehension in the midst of where we are.  If this graph were doing this, if it were going down, I would be OK with it. But it is not going down; it is going up. It is getting worse, and we have to deal with it.  As we work through this issue of healthcare--hopefully we are going to start with a blank sheet of paper over here--I hope we will bear in mind that one of the most serious health problems in the country today is opioid[[Page S2861]]abuse. This is not all about ideology, and it is not about policy. It is about people. It is about Matt, and it is about It is about the thousands and millions of people across this country who are struggling, who want to lead productive lives, and who want to contribute to their communities. All they need is to have that moment when treatment is available, when a helping hand is available, when caring is available to help them escape the throes of this terrible disease and rejoin their communities and their families. That is what we have to keep in front of us as we work here in this body. We can make a difference in people's lives, but in leaving them behind, we will certainly not do so.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2017-05-10-pt1-PgS2853.txt,1724,IN RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL LISA L.A. EPPERSON,2017.0,10.0,May
391,topic-id,2635,"Mr.President, I join in the minority leader's remarks and his plan for moving forward, which is a bipartisan plan and a plea for our colleagues to work together.  America is not like some countries where people are all of the same ethnic background or practice the same religion. America is an idea. America is an ideal. America is something that is grounded in our democracy.  Way back centuries ago, our Founding Fathers were concerned about foreign influence on our democracy. They were concerned at the time about Great Well, now we have another concern, and that concern is It is not just the Democrats' concern. As one of our colleagues, Senator Rubio, has noted in the past, maybe this election was an attack on one political candidate in one party, but next time it will be the other party. That is why we must join together and handle this correctly and in the spirit of our democracy and our  I have known Director Comey for a long time. We were classmates at the University of Chicago Law He was well liked in our class, and he earned the respect of the agents he supervised and the law enforcement he worked with. I made it clear to him that I didn't agree with how he handled the email investigation regarding Secretary Clinton, but nevertheless this man is a hard worker and someone of integrity. Just because someone doesn't agree with how an investigation is handled, even if it is in a big way, doesn't mean this person should be fired.  FBI Directors have 10-year terms for a reason; that is because we want them to be independent from political influence.  All Americans, including those who have criticized Director Comey for whatever reason in the past, should be very troubled by the timing of this firing.  Let's look at the past week. We started the week on Monday, when Former Director Clapper testified in great detail about the Russian threat to our democracy and the fact that the Russians feel empowered and that he believes they will do it again and again. We also were on the heels of the French cyber attack, where their elections were attacked and where Russia was trying to get involved in their elections.  Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified, and she made very clear that she had not just given a heads-up to the administration that their National Security Advisor was compromised by the Russians--no. She had two formal meetings over at the White She outlined in detail how she had gone over to the White House and voiced her concerns.  When I asked both Former Director Clapper and former Acting Attorney General Yates whether this was material for blackmail--when you have a high-ranking official saying one thing on a tape recording that the Russians knew he had said and then another to the Vice President of the United States--if that was material for blackmail, they said yes, definitively yes, that he had been compromised.  Yet, as it became clear, the White House then allowed the National Security Advisor, General Flynn, to stay on for 18 days, including being part of an hour-long conversation between the President of the United States and Vladimir So that is what happened on  We know what was going to happen tomorrow, Thursday, which is that Director Comey was going to testify in his capacity as the FBI Director in front of the Senate Intelligence We know questions were going to be asked about Of course, I commend Senators Burr and Warner for inviting him again next week in his capacity now as a private citizen.  Yet, when you look at what has happened here--the Yates and Clapper testimony on Monday, the Comey testimony expected on Thursday--what is sandwiched in between? It is the firing of the FBI By the way, this is the same FBI Director who had the audacity to tell the truth before Congress when he was asked whether President Obama had wiretapped the Trump Tower, as alleged by President Trump in a tweet at 6 in the morning. The FBI Director truthfully answered, no, that it did not happen. That is also something that has happened in the past month.  Today we learned that just days before he was fired, Mr.Comey asked senior officials at the Justice Department for more resources in order to carry out the Russia investigation.  Now, what are my colleagues saying about this? I think it is very important to note that the two Senators who are privy to the most classified information--Senator McCain, as chair of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator Burr, as chair of the Intelligence Committee--have both expressed serious concerns about what has happened.  Senator McCain said he was disappointed, and Senator Burr, the Republican chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said:       I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director      Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a      public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal      further confuses an already difficult investigation by the       Senator Flake said:       I have spent the last several hours trying to find an      acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just      can't do it.  The reasoning the White House is using for Director Comey's firing is bizarre, and that is why I believe Senator Burr said that his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation.  The memo provided by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein cites old justifications. These are quotes from letters that I remember from the Presidential campaign, and they are used in the letter as a justification.  If the administration found Director Comey's conduct during the election to be so problematic, why now--right, smack in the middle of the advancements of this Russia investigation?  The answer, I believe, is that the justification that is provided in the memo is a pretext. The fact that President Trump's termination letter to Director Comey strangely discusses the fact that Director Comey informed the President that he was not under investigation in the context of the Russia investigation sheds light on what this is really about; that Director Comey was seeking the truth.  Senator Burr said that Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI Director he can recall in his tenure on the congressional intelligence committees. In firing Comey, President Trump has cast doubt about the independence and viability of any further investigation into the foreign interference of our democracy.  Why was Attorney General Sessions, who had recused himself from the investigation on Russian interference, able to influence the firing of the man at the helm of the Russia investigation?  That is one of the questions we want answered and why, by the way, we believe it is important to have a closed-door briefing with the Deputy Attorney General and his predecessor.  Did Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein act on his own or at the direction of Attorney General Sessions or the White House?  Are reports that the President had been searching for a rationale to fire the FBI Director for more than a week true?  Was his firing influenced by any recent developments in the investigation, like the issuance of grand jury[[Page S2869]]subpoenas or Director Comey's recent request for more resources for the Russia investigation?  Why didn't the President wait for the inspector general's investigation into Director Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation to conclude before making his decision to fire him?  I am a former prosecutor. I believe in facts, and I believe in evidence. These decisions should not have been made without these facts and without this evidence and while in the middle of a major investigation of Russian influence in our election. Answers to these questions are essential in getting to the truth and in ensuring that an independent investigation at the FBI can continue.  For months, U.intelligence agencies--17 of them--have said that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to try and undermine our democracy. Reports show it. The facts prove it. When former Director of National Intelligence Clapper testified, he said Russia will continue to interfere in our election system.  This is what he said exactly:       I believe [Russia is] now emboldened to continue such      activities in the future, both here and around the world, and      to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a      clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the      very foundation of our democratic political system, this      episode is it.  I was in that hearing and asked questions of Clapper when he said this: ``Vigilance.'' That is what he said--vigilance.  How can we call it vigilance, when the FBI Director, who is conducting the investigation, has been fired? What message does that send to Russia? Does that make them think we are serious about this investigation; that we want to get to the bottom of it and that we do not want it to happen again? It sends the opposite message.  Aides and surrogates of the Trump administration, during the campaign and the transition, were in contact with officials from a foreign government that was actively working to tear our democracy apart. We need to know why and when and how. In the first question, that is what I really want to know--the ``why.''  This week, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, as I mentioned, and Director Clapper reminded us that on the very day President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its unprecedented attacks on our democracy, a member of the Trump transition team spoke to a senior Russian official regarding those sanctions. Michael Flynn, the National Security Advisor--the person charged with the most sensitive matters of U.national security--was not truthful with the Vice He lied to the Vice President about contact with Russian officials. In turn, the American people were misled.  After the Department of Justice warned the administration that the National Security Advisor had lied and may be vulnerable to blackmail by the Russian Government, what did the administration do? It continued to allow General Flynn to handle top secret information for 18 more days. They let him participate in an hour-long phone call between President Trump and Vladimir In fact, decisive action was not taken until the Washington Post revealed what was happening.  We have now seen two people resign--Trump's campaign manager and his National Security The one thing they have in common is Russia and the We have also seen three people fired--Sally Yates, the Acting Attorney General of the United States, who was simply doing her job; Preet Bharara, the U.attorney in New York City; and Jim Comey, the FBI The one thing they have in common is that they were all investigating links, and they were doing their jobs.  Think about that. Let that sink in. The independent government officials who were or could have been charged with getting to the truth, no matter where it led, were fired.  We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of what is going on here. It is our job to get to the bottom of this because the President of the United States--President Trump--cannot fire We need to know the full extent of the Trump campaign's contact with the Russian Government during the campaign and transition, including what was said and what was done and who knew about it.  That is why, on January 4, I stood with Senator Cardin and with Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings, of the House of Representatives, and called for an independent commission. Now, this is different than the special prosecutor whom we need to handle the criminal investigation. This is also different than the good work that is being done by the Senate Intelligence Committee under the leadership of Senators Burr and  To me, an independent commission would help us because it could get to the bottom of what has happened, with the intent of making sure it does not happen again, in order to protect our democracy. It could have recommendations, just like the 9/11 Commission had, on how we could improve our laws. It could have recommendations on what we could do if the media gets hold of information that is the result of a cyber attack from a foreign government. It could have recommendations of what political parties and campaigns could do--perhaps even in agreement--when they get access to information that is a result of a cyber attack against the opposite party.  It was not that long ago when campaigns would come upon debate information and other things and would simply put it in an envelope and send it back to the other side. We can do this, but that is not going to come out of some simple piece of legislation or from the work that the Intelligence Committee is doing.  That is why I believe we need this independent commission as well as a special prosecutor to look into all contacts between Trump aides and surrogates and Russian officials during the campaign, transition, and administration. This prosecutor must be fair and impartial and completely unattached to either political party.  In addition to the independent commission, we also need our congressional committees, as I mentioned, to continue to exercise their oversight authority.  Since the election, we have heard a lot about the three branches of government and our system of checks and balances. One of Congress's fundamental jobs, as I told a group of students in my office today, is to closely oversee the executive branch in order to ensure that the law is being properly followed and enforced. This shouldn't just be things that students learn from their Senators when they come in during school trips or be what they learn from a textbook. This is actually our job.  This means that in addition to this independent, 9/11-style Commission, we must make sure our congressional committees continue to investigate Russian interference in our political system. We have subpoena power. We need to use it.  Some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand the importance of doing our jobs in order to get to the bottom of this. As I mentioned, we have the Intelligence Committee investigation, but we also have the Judiciary subcommittee, on which I serve, led by Senators Graham and They are the ones who held the hearing with Sally Yates and Director Clapper this week.  This is an unprecedented time in our country's history. We are witnessing a singular moment of constitutional and democratic unease. In recent months, foundational elements of our democracy, including the rule of law, have been questioned, challenged, and even undermined.  Several of my colleagues have compared the President's action to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating Even then, Mr.Cox was replaced by a new special prosecutor. Today, we have no special prosecutor to determine whether the President's campaign colluded with a hostile foreign power. Some in Congress are continuing to resist any serious investigation. For that reason, our democracy may be in even greater peril. The night he was fired, Mr.Cox defended his decision to conduct the Watergate investigation as he saw fit rather than to yield to the President's order that he limit his request for tape recordings.  Cox said: ``Whether ours shall continue to be a government of laws and not of men is now for Congress and, ultimately, the American people.''[[Page S2870]]  He is right. The American people deserve a thorough, independent investigation into the extent of Russia's interference in the 2016 Presidential election.  This is not a partisan issue. Americans deserve answers now. And where should they get those answers? They should get those answers from this Chamber, because we, as Members of the Senate, cannot be fired.  I yield the floor.

520,topic-id,1127,"Mr.President, I join my colleagues in speaking about the opioid crisis that has devastated families in States across the country.  I thank my colleague, Senator Manchin, for organizing the speeches today.  In my State, deaths from prescription drug abuse have now claimed the lives of more Minnesotans than have homicides or car crashes. We lost our beloved Prince because of an opioid overdose, which is still being investigated. Just as importantly, we lost a student in Duluth and a mom in Rochester, MN--over 400 people in just the last year. We continue to see dangerous synthetic opioids shipped across our borders in increasing amounts--a trend that the U.Customs and Border Protection expects to continue, as we heard in a Judiciary Committee hearing last week.  Today, I joined Senator Portman in his subcommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and we talked about what is going on from that perspective as well.  While there is more work to do to combat this epidemic, first, I recognize that we have made some meaningful progress on a bipartisan basis. We passed the CARA Act, which is something that was led by Senators Portman, Whitehouse, Ayotte, and me. We set a framework up for the Nation, and I look at it in three ways.  The first way is that we have to do everything we can to prevent addiction. That means changing some of our prescription practices across the country. Do you really need 30 pills when you get your wisdom teeth out? It is about asking those questions and changing those practices.  The second thing would be to look at prescription drug monitoring. Senator Portman and I have a bill that would make it mandatory for States to share their data across State borders. I found a guy in Moorhead, MN, through his rehab counselor, who had 108 different prescriptions for opioids from something like 80 different doctors in 50 different cities. He went from North Dakota to South Dakota, to Minnesota, to That is why sharing that data would greatly reduce that doctor shopping.  I see here the Senator from Texas, Mr.Senator Cornyn and I led a bill years ago to make it easier for people to throw away their leftover prescription drugs so they would not get in the hands of those who should not be taking them. Those are ideas for reducing that demand.  Then you go to the next area, which, of course, is that of trying to reduce the illegal drugs from coming in, like with the STOP Act, which Senator Portman and I introduced, making it harder to get these drugs in through the Postal Service, and doing more with law enforcement. By passing the SALTS Act, which is a bill that Senator Graham and I introduced, it will make it easier for prosecutors--the Presiding Officer is a former prosecutor--to prove up cases with analogue drugs, which is when perpetrators basically take a substance, change it a little, and then say: Hey, it is a new drug. Then it makes it harder for the Feds to go after it, and you have to prove it up in court.  So we are making some changes to our law to make it easier, especially in rural areas, where they are not going to be able to get a medical doctor in to prove up what the substance is in order to make it easier to prove these cases.  These are all very good ideas, but what we are here to talk about today is the issue of the funding and what will happen if we do not have the funding for treatment. We did a good job with the Cures Act last December, in which we made $1 billion available over 2 years, as well as the work that was done on a bipartisan basis with the budget for the rest of the year. I consider those good signs.  Unfortunately, the budget and the CBO score of the healthcare repeal bill that was released this week--the bill that came over from the House--shows us that we are at risk of working backwards on this issue.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, mental health and substance abuse benefits could be cut under the healthcare bill, which would increase out-of-pocket costs by thousands of dollars for those who need these vital services. This is on top of the $839 billion in cuts to Medicaid under the bill and additional cuts in the President's budget of more than $600 billion to Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, even though these programs cover 3 out of every 10 people who have an opioid addiction. This would be devastating for so many, if these budget cuts took effect.  I would like to do more. I would, actually, like to pass the LifeBOAT Act, which Senator Manchin introduced and I am a cosponsor. That would simply put an extra fee on some of these opioids so that the people who have been reaping the profits from these drugs would be helping to pay for the treatment. I think that is a great idea. Unfortunately, this budget takes us the other way.  It eliminates programs that help rural communities build hospitals and get access to vital telemedicine services. It cuts critical medical research that is happening at the NIH--just when, at the end of last year, we added that money to the NIH's funding. It was shown just in the last month that, with the budget for the rest of the year, we have continued that positive trend. The budget also doubles down on other cuts that would hurt small towns and rural communities, which would impact jobs and opportunities. It eliminates rural business programs, which have helped to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. It cuts rural housing programs and infrastructure grants and loan programs.[[Page S3168]]  Altogether, these cuts not only threaten the progress we have made in fighting against the opioid crisis, but they also threaten the prosperity of the rural communities, which have been the hardest hit. We need a budget that helps and not hurts rural  We have a lot of work to do. I appreciate, again, the work of our Democratic and Republican colleagues in the As we have shown with the budget--from last month through the rest of this year--we have put some common sense in there and have done a good job and have gotten a lot of bipartisan support.

(3) The United States has not been an active member of the      BIE since 2001.       (4) State and local governments and private entities in the      United States have continued to participate in international      expositions held in foreign countries as a means of promoting      United States exports and creating jobs, but face      significantly higher costs for such participation because the      United States is not an active member.       (5) State and local governments and private entities in the      United States have expressed interest in an international      exposition being hosted in the United States, but the bid of      a United States city, region, or State to host an      international exposition is unlikely to be successful if the      United States is not a member of the     3.

The damage caused to our economy and environment by leaving the Paris Agreement is undeniable, but it was also completely foreseeable. That is why the first piece of legislation I wrote as a member of Congress called for our country to keep the pledges we made in this agreement, the promises we made to the world, and to ourselves.  Through his decision, the President is ceding American leadership in the green economy to China, and kneecapping the global effort to counter the effects of climate change. While the President has made his choice, the rest of us can make ours.  We must continue to resist global climate change by expanding our commitments to green technology and sustainable practices.

528,topic-id,2257,"Madam President, we have a lot of issues we are working on right now. Some of the big ones include the budget conversation. For the first time in a long time, the budget conversation really circles around, how are we going to get back to balance? It is an interesting dialogue. There is going to be a lot of dispute about elements of the President's budget. There will be a lot of controversy back and forth about aspects in the House and the Senate proposals. But for the first time in a long time, the beginning point of the conversation is, how do we get back to balance? That is a good place to start. I am pleased to see that is a part of the conversation again.  There are a tremendous number of things that have to be dealt with in this process. I want to bring up two quick ones and then talk about some of the small business issues we are facing.  One of them is that when we go through the budget process, I encourage my colleagues to deal with the budget gimmicks that are still in place in the budget process--areas that seem to bring down the deficit but we all know actually do not. Those don't help us as That may help with some sort of scoring issues; that doesn't really help where we are.  The second aspect to that is, let's actually put the appropriations bills on the floor. For the last several years, there have been continuing resolutions or omnibuses without any amendment process brought. We should be able to, in a bipartisan way, agree to bring these appropriations bills to the floor, actually have an amendment process, and actually deal with this in a public setting. There are straightforward ways to deal with our debt and deficit.[[Page S3175]]It begins with actually confronting debt and deficit in a way that will really matter.  It is interesting as well that when we talk about a lot of the big issues, regulations often come up as one of the prime problems. Regulations are often big, expensive, and deal with a lot of controversy.  Quite frankly, there are thousands of regulations out there that impact small businesses. For a small business, it is not typically just one regulation, it is the hundreds of little ones that they are constantly trying to live under. It is the culmination of all of these different regulations and trying to figure out where they are. Most small businesses don't have lawyers. They don't have compliance people. They don't have folks lined up to monitor all of these things. They have to try to figure it out as they go. They are small businesses. They are family-owned businesses. They are trying to take care of their own families and the neighbors around them. But all of these regulations come at them as well.  Let me read what Karen Karrigan, the president and CEO of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, wrote in an op-ed just last week. She wrote:       Red tape is strangling our small businesses and undermining      entrepreneurship. Indeed, according to [Small Business and      Entrepreneurship] Council research, the cumulative loss of      new businesses over the last decade totals 3.42 million      missing businesses--  Not workers--     for America's economy. For existing small businesses, the      per-employee cost of regulation is just over $11,000.      Excessive regulation in the U.has hurt our competitiveness      in the global economy. The U.ranks 51 in the world for      ease of starting a business, according to the World      This same report is consistent with other global studies that      have found American's friendliness and general ``ease of      doing business'' has eroded year after year.  That is according to Karen Karrigan, president and CEO of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, in her op-ed last week.  Each new regulation on small business adds another cost, another burden, another requirement that small businesses have to comply with. This cumulative burden is crushing small business.  Let me give some examples. Julian Lumber Company is in Antlers, You ought to come and see Antlers, It is a beautiful area of our Julian Lumber Company, a family-owned business, makes wooden fence posts, treated poles. If you have a telephone pole in that area or other posts and poles, it often came from Julian Lumber It also has a small trucking company to be able to haul posts to retail stores across the Midwest and the Julian employs about 50 people but recently had to shift a part-time employee who was doing compliance to full-time--doing nothing but compliance 40 hours a week because of all the Federal regulations. When Robert Julian funded this business in 1974, he didn't set out to just create jobs for a compliance officer, he actually set out to do lumber work, but unfortunately, now his business also includes Federal compliance.  Small businesses are vital to our economy. Surely we can agree on that. They drive job creation and innovation. Excessive and poorly crafted government regulations disproportionately--the burden of them--fall on small businesses and on their growth. If Julian Lumber has to hire more people to just do compliance, not lumber, there is a problem.  Then there is Ander's Shoe Store in Miami, OK, which was founded in 1930 by Joe Ander after he immigrated to Oklahoma from Today, Ander's Shoe Store is owned and operated by Joe's daughter, Dena Ander, who is 102 years old. She has worked at Ander's Shoe Store for 86 years.  My favorite quote ever from a small business owner came from her when she said, at 101, that her health is better than her help, and so she just keeps working.  Dena Anders is not waking up every day and reading the Federal Register to find out what new Federal regulation came down. She is not trying to track through all the different compliance officers and attorneys that she would have to contact to try to figure out how to read a new Federal regulation that comes down. She is taking care of a shoe store in Miami, She has two employees, but her shoe store has to live by the same regulations that a lot of large stores also have to live by.  Every Member of this body--when they are home, they talk about small businesses and the importance of small businesses and how to help them succeed. I am asking, are we as a body willing to do what we said we were going to do back home? Ninety-seven percent of the businesses in my State of Oklahoma are small businesses. Lots of us make promises to these small businesses. It is time to fulfill them.  Regulatory reform for even small businesses, for whatever reason, is becoming politicized. This is not a political, Republican-Democrat issue. Small business owners are not Republicans or Democrats; they are They are people, and this should not be a partisan issue. I would be willing to work with every Senator of any party to be able to get this done.  I have introduced the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements It has passed its way through committee. It is 584. It does some simple things--things that should not be controversial.  It closes loopholes in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which became law in 1980. That bill was designed to help small businesses, but there are some loopholes in it, and the agencies are going around it.  This is not a bill that I just came up with on my own; it is a bill that had been drafted in direct response to small businesses and small business leaders around the country. It has been discussed for a long time, but for whatever reason, it has never been passed. I want to run through a few things that it does.  First, the agencies should account for the economic impact of regulations, especially on small business, and it should be the full economic impact. Agencies have this little caveat that they will do. They will say: Well, it is not a direct cost, it is an indirect cost on business. So they will put a new regulation on them and say: We are only going to count direct costs of the regulations, but we are not going to count anything indirect, such as electricity.  If they put a Federal regulation down and a State entity is then required to create new regulations based on it, they won't count the State regulations based on it.  If permitting from a different agency is required, they will say: Well, that is somebody else who does that.  Well, if you are a small business, cost is cost is cost. The Federal Government plays this game of what is a direct and indirect cost to a business. A small business does not get to play that game, and they have to pay the bills for it.  So it is a very simple thing for us to say: Include the costs. We try to get some clear language on it. An agency would have to consider ``reasonably foreseeable impacts.'' So I get that you are not going to get every pencil in the process, but what is reasonably foreseeable, you should be able to anticipate that.  Second, we require the IRS to actually listen to small businesses before they release IRS rules. So many hours are spent by every small business complying with IRS regulations and requirements. We would like to have the IRS actually engage with small businesses when they put out policy and guidance and say: How is this going to affect small businesses? How can they work this out to make sure it is as easy as possible for small business owners?  Third, increase the transparency in the rulemaking process. Small businesses tell me that when they learn of new regulatory requirements, they are often blindsided. They had no idea the rule was even coming. In the rare instance when a small business owner speaks out to an agency, they are often confused when they see the final rule because it doesn't look at all like what they had recommended or had raised.  Years ago, there was something created called SBRFIA panels. Only Washington, DC, comes up with a term like that. Small businesses were supposed to be able to engage with the Federal Government on designing how regulations would come out. But, again, the loopholes were so present in the law that the agencies were just going around them. We need to close that.  As simple as it sounds, when an agency is creating a rule, don't you think[[Page S3176]]they should call small businesses and say: How will this work at your place, or will it work at all?  Fourth, let's deal with old rules. There are lots of regulations out there that are old, that become very complicated for small businesses to be able to maintain, and no one has ever gone back to look at them. Let's create a simple system so that when a rule comes out, it has to be reviewed within 10 years. That way, we have no rule that is 40, 50 years old, and no one has even touched it or looked at it to make sure that it still works, 1, and that it is not overcomplicating the process.  Finally, and here is something pretty straightforward, give first-time forgiveness for paperwork violations. When small businesses have a paperwork violation, they have a paperwork violation. They are not trying to break the law. They are not trying to violate regulations. They missed one. Why don't we give first-time grace to small businesses? Now, I wouldn't say that if they are violating health and safety issues. Obviously those are things they should have already taken care of. But just paperwork things--we have so many small businesses that get a fine because they missed a piece of paperwork. Again, so many small businesses don't have compliance people tracking this stuff for them all the time, and occasionally they make a mistake. This is still a government that works for them. They don't work for the government.  My simple recommendation is this: For small businesses, give them first-time paperwork forgiveness rather than a Federal compliance person showing up at their place with a fine. Let's be reasonable about this. That should be a simple, straightforward thing.  Quite frankly, these are all things small business owners have asked for. These were things even in the Obama administration. The chief counsel for the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy--this is what the Obama administration's small business advocate wanted. I don't understand how this could be a partisan issue. It is simple, straightforward, and clean. There is no hidden anything in the bill. It is trying to actually get regulatory relief and common sense back into the way we do regulations.  Over 200 trade associations representing millions of small businesses have already written me in support of this bill from all over the country--not from Oklahoma, from all over the country.  Many in this Chamber pride themselves on being the advocate for the little guy and standing up for small businesses. I would ask my colleagues if they are ready to actually put feet to those words. This is a straightforward way to do it. We talk about helping small businesses; let's actually do it. I ask my colleagues to be able to walk alongside of us and help us get this bill passed and get some regulatory relief.  I yield the floor.

373,topic-id,1423,"I thank the                         Firing of James Comey  Madam President, I couldn't help but think, with the discussions earlier today, that the President's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey is so inappropriate that it is hard to know where to begin.  In less than 4 months, this President has pushed our country to the edge of a constitutional crisis--a crisis that in many ways seems more complex, and potentially more threatening, than the one instigated by President Nixon's order to fire the special prosecutor who was investigating  First, I think we can easily dismiss President Trump's transparent pretext for dismissing FBI Director  President Trump claims to have removed the FBI Director because of his unfair treatment of Secretary This does not pass the laugh test, and we know it is not true. President Trump celebrated Director Comey's mistakes in handling the Clinton email investigation. He encouraged leaks from the He pressed Director Comey to release more embarrassing evidence. He even praised Director Comey after the Director's misguided letter to Congress last Yet, now, the President would have us believe that these same events compelled him to fire the FBI Director more than 6 months after it occurred. This unbelievable claim, if it was not so sad, would be laughable.  The truth is that the President removed the sitting FBI Director in the midst of one of the most critical national security investigations in the history of our country and, certainly, one of the most critical in my 42 years in the Senate--a sprawling inquiry that implicates senior officials in the Trump campaign and administration.  The press is now reporting that President Trump weighed firing the FBI Director for more than a week, after he became enraged at Director Comey's statements and actions in the Russia investigation. There are even reports that his firing may have been precipitated by grand jury subpoenas issued to associates of President Trump's former National Security I have no doubt that we are going to learn more disturbing details as to the President's true motivations. I am willing to bet anything that none of them will be because of the feeling that the FBI was too tough on Secretary  I am also troubled that Attorney General Sessions played a role in Director Comey's firing. The Attorney General had supposedly recused himself from the Russia investigation--and for good reason: He was a central figure in the Trump campaign that is now under investigation. And he provided false testimony to the Judiciary Committee to hide his own contacts with Russian officials. Having done that, it is beyond inappropriate for him to then recommend the firing of the official overseeing the Russia investigation.  I ask: Does anyone really believe that President Trump is interested in getting to the bottom of Russia's interference with our elections? Based on his past performance, does anyone believe the Attorney General is interested in getting to the bottom of Russia's interference with our elections? Does anyone believe that the White House will allow investigators to follow the facts without interference or obstruction at every turn?  In fact, a quick review of President Trump's Twitter account, where he does most of his deep thinking, would dispel any such illusions.  This is the same White House that interfered with the House Intelligence Committee's investigation--interference so strong that the Republican chairman in the House investigation had to recuse himself.  This is the same White House that reportedly sought access to the highly classified FISA Court surveillance order that purportedly authorized surveillance of Trump associates.  This is the same White House that demanded the FBI Director and the Department of Justice issue perfunctory statements to clear President Trump's name.  Even the President's letter informing FBI Director Comey of his dismissal indicated the President had directly asked the FBI Director whether he was under investigation--three times. That should never happen. No President should be asking such a question. It is stunning, but it should also be informative. It is clear that any credible investigation must take place outside the political chain of command.  That is why I and others have said for months that a special counsel must be appointed to lead the Russia investigation. A special counsel, unlike an FBI Director or a Deputy Attorney General, cannot be fired by the The American people must have confidence that ours is a government of laws, not of the whim of a President--any  Frankly, our Nation is at a precipice. There is a counterintelligence investigation into the campaign and administration of a sitting There is evidence that that campaign colluded with a foreign government that is an adversary of ours to sway our Presidential election. Now the President has fired the lead investigator, FBI Director Comey, under what any fairminded person would say is absurd and false pretenses.  There are several inquiries underway into Russian interference and collusion with Russia in the elections, but the President has fired the head of the only investigation that could bring criminal charges. In fact, it has just been reported that this came just days after Director Comey asked for additional funding for the investigation. None of this is normal--it is something I have never seen in Republican or Democratic administrations--and we cannot treat it as such.  President Putin's goal, as we now know, last year was to undermine our democratic institutions, to corrode Americans' trust and faith in government, and to sway the outcome of the election in favor of Donald If we do not get to the bottom of Russia's interference in our democracy, Putin will be successful. The President appears to be content with that result. But I know, in talking with many Republican Senators as well as Democratic Senators, that they are not content with it.  We have to understand, in our great democracy, in the greatest Nation on Earth, that we cannot allow any country to try to interfere in our elections. We know the Russians wanted to do that. We know President Putin wanted to do that. We know he wants to do it in many other countries. I think we owe it, not only to ourselves but all these other countries, to stand up and say: We know what you are trying to do; here is how you tried to do it. America won't stand for it, and we hope none of our democratic allies will.  We 100 Senators may disagree on policy matters and we may have supported different candidates last November, but I respect all Senators, and I believe we all agree on the supremacy of the rule of law. No person, no President should be above the supremacy of the rule of law. I believe we fulfill our duty to the country if we stand united in calling for a truly independent investigation. There simply is no avoiding the fact that this cascading situation demands the prompt appointment of an independent special counsel to pick up the pieces of these investigations. How we respond at this moment[[Page S2862]]is a test of our commitment to the separation of powers. It is a test of whether the Senate can truly be the conscience of the Nation, as it should. This is not just a scandal. The President's actions are neither Republican nor They are authoritarian. This is an effort to undo the ties that bind our democratic form of government. All of us--both sides of the aisle--must now put country over party.  In my years here, I have worked with both Republican and Democratic I have worked with them and supported them, notwithstanding their parties, in what I felt was in the best interest of this country. I feel privileged that Vermont has allowed me to serve long enough to become, as my predecessor was, dean of the But I have also, in deciding to stay here as a Senator, always had the abiding faith that you can and should be the conscience of the This great Nation deserves no less. That means we set aside party labels and adopt just one label--United States  With that, let us make sure there is a clear, full, credible, honest investigation of how Russia tried to influence our elections; a full, clear, thorough, honest investigation into if Russia has ties to anybody in our government; and, a full, clear, honest understanding of how we make sure that never happens again, to either Republicans or  I yield the floor.

395,topic-id,708,"Mr.President, on July 13, Global Witness, a widely respected international nongovernmental organization that reports on corruption and other criminality involving the exploitation of natural resources, released a report entitled, ``Defenders of the Earth--Global Killings of Land and Environmental Defenders in 2016.''  According to the report, 2016 was the worst year yet for environmental and land rights defenders. At least 200 were killed in what has become a global crisis, pitting local communities, particularly impoverished indigenous groups, against multinational mining, logging, agribusiness, hydroelectric, and hydrocarbon companies that are often supported with foreign financing.  The report says the number of such killings is increasing, up from 185 in 2015 and spreading to new countries--24 in 2016 compared to 16 in 2015. However, because many of these attacks occur in remote areas, the actual number is likely much higher. The number of killings is also only part of the appalling story. Death threats, arbitrary arrests, sexual assaults and other forms of abuse, and misuse of the legal process are among the tactics used to try to intimidate environmental activists.  Often, when faced with peaceful resistance to the construction of dams that displace people from their homes and to logging and mining operations that destroy the forest and pollute the water, the response of the companies, backed up by local security forces, is to accuse the protestors of being ``against development,'' try to divide them with bribes and promises that are later broken, and eventually to silence them with force. The companies get rich and move on, local officials collect payoffs, the electricity or minerals are exported to cities or other countries, and the people whose land was destroyed or water contaminated are immeasurably worse off.  As one activist, who has for years spoken out against Latin America's largest open pit mine, told Global Witness, ``[t]hey threaten you so you will shut up. I can't shut up. I can't stay silent faced with all that is happening to my people. We are fighting for our lands, for our water, for our lives.''  The reports states, ``[t]he battle to protect the planet is rapidly intensifying and the cost can be counted in human lives. More people in more countries are being left with no option but to take a stand against the theft of their land or the trashing of their environment. Too often they are brutally silenced by political and business elites, while the investors that bankroll them do nothing. . . Almost 40 percent of those murdered were indigenous, as land they've inhabited for generations is stolen by companies, landowners or government officials. Projects are typically imposed on communities without their free, prior and informed consent, backed up by force: police and soldiers are suspected perpetrators in at least 43 murders. Protest is often the only option left to communities exercising their right to have a say about the use of their land and natural resources, putting them on a collision course with those seeking profit at any cost.''  The report notes the criminalization of these courageous activists, including in the United ``They are often painted as criminals, facing trumped-up criminal charges and aggressive civil cases brought by governments and companies seeking to silence them.''  It is the responsibility of governments to defend the lives and rights of their citizens. Instead, too many governments are violating their own laws and aiding and abetting in these attacks and assassinations--either by the conduct of their security forces or by their failure to conduct credible investigations of these crimes and to bring those responsible to justice.  Honduran activist Berta Caceres is but one example. Instead of protecting her, the government and the company treated her like a criminal. She was killed for having the courage to defend the rights and territory of the Lenca people. In Honduras alone--a country the size of Kentucky with just 8 million people--more than 100 environmental defenders have reportedly suffered similar fates since 2009, for which no one has been convicted and punished.  I hope this report will spur governments, companies, foreign banks, and international financial institutions to take far stronger action to respect the territorial rights of affected people, to defend freedom of speech and association, to protect the environment, and to uphold the rule of law.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-17-pt1-PgS4021.txt,1383,1230,2017.0,17.0,May
524,topic-id,954,"Madam President, just 1 week after a party-line vote in the Judiciary Committee, the Senate is about to vote on the nomination of Judge Amul Thapar to the Sixth Circuit Court of It has been more than 16 months since the Senate confirmed a Federal appellate judge and almost 11 months since we voted on a circuit or district nomination. That is because of Leader McConnell's unprecedented obstruction, blocking any votes on President Obama's qualified, consensus nominees, all in an effort to leave as many judicial vacancies as possible for President Trump and the far right special interest groups who are charged with selecting his nominees.  The 7 days Judge Thapar has waited for a vote is quite a contrast with the last circuit judge that Leader McConnell permitted to be confirmed. Judge Felipe Restrepo's nomination languished for 6 months on the Senate floor last Congress before he was finally given a floor vote. Of course, there was no good reason for that. Judge Restrepo had bipartisan support at every step of the process: positive blue slips from his Democratic and Republican home State Senators, a voice vote in the Judiciary Committee, and a bipartisan 82-6 confirmation vote. Likewise, there was no good reason for Leader McConnell to deny votes on other circuit nominees like Donald Schott and Jennifer They were reported with strong bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee and had bipartisan support from their home State Senators, but were left languishing on the Executive Calendar for months, without ever receiving floor consideration. We should not forget the 20 district nominees and the five Court of Federal Claims nominees, who were reported with bipartisan support and then fell victim to Senate Republicans' unprecedented obstruction and were denied a vote after waiting months or even years. Of course, we cannot overlook one of the most shameful inactions of the Senate--the treatment of Chief Judge Merrick Garland, who did not even receive a hearing for his nomination to the U.Supreme  So why are we now rushing to confirm Judge Thapar? It is only fair to note that the seat to which he has been nominated has been vacant for nearly 4 years. President Obama's nominee to that seat did not receive this expedited process. She did not even receive blue slips from the Kentucky Now, that is their right. Had I still been chairman, I would have honored that decision--as I did for both circuit and district nominees--however much I might have disagreed with it. We should not pretend that we are required to vote so quickly on Judge Thapar simply because the Republican leadership held this seat vacant.  This is a nomination that requires thorough consideration by the It is no secret that Judge Thapar is a favorite of the same far right groups that handpicked Justice Gorsuch--in fact, Judge Thapar was on the same shortlist that they gave to President[[Page S3173]]Given Judge Thapar's apparent views on campaign finance regulation, it is no surprise that these groups, who are some of the biggest opponents of any efforts to bring transparency to campaign financing, want to see him elevated to a circuit court. His answers during his hearing did not allay my concerns.  I was also troubled by Judge Thapar's responses to my written questions. Like Justice Gorsuch, he dodged a very simple question about whether the First Amendment permits a religious litmus test for entry into the United States, but even that nonanswer was inaccurate. Judge Thapar responded that the constitutionality of a religious litmus test is an active question in pending litigation regarding the president's Executive order targeting Muslim-majority countries, and that he could not comment on it. That is not accurate. There is no question that such a religious litmus test is unconstitutional--even the Trump administration does not argue otherwise. Instead, they are arguing that the Executive order does not impose such a litmus test. Judge Thapar failed to get the facts right, and failed to show me that he understands one of the most fundamental principles of our It will be very difficult for me to support any judicial nominee who fails to answer this question with adherence to both the Constitution and the facts.  The role that far right interest groups have played in this nomination and the Gorsuch nomination is troubling. A President is free to consult with whomever he wishes on potential nominees, but the ``advice and consent'' power belongs to the Senate, not the Federalist For decades, Presidents of both parties have consulted with home State Senators, a requirement formalized through the Judiciary Committee's blue slip process. This tradition protects the role of all 100 Senators in the confirmation process and helps ensure that Presidents work with Senators of both parties to find consensus nominees.  During my nearly 20 years as either chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I encouraged Republicans and Democrats to work with President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama to find qualified, consensus nominees, and I protected the rights of Senators in both parties. As Ranking Member Feinstein noted in a memo that was circulated yesterday, no judicial nomination made by the last three Presidents was confirmed without the support of both home State I cannot recall a nominee being confirmed over the objection of his or her home State The blue slip is not a partisan issue; it is about constitutional checks and balances and the Senate's role in protecting the independence of our Federal judiciary. I encourage President Trump to follow the example of his predecessors from both parties and work with us to find consensus nominees to ensure that our Federal courts remain the envy of the rest of the world.

Every citizen in every State deserves to have the same ability as citizens in States like California, Arizona, Hawaii, and Ohio, who now have to draw their Congressional district boundaries without the influence and gamesmanship of politics.  The political gerrymandering of our congressional districts, which attacks at the very bedrock the right of every American to fair representation, has seriously undermined the public's trust in our democratic system.

529,topic-id,2189,"Madam President, I rise to speak with a lot of my colleagues coming down speaking on the opiate crisis we have in all of our  West Virginia has been hit the hardest in the Nation right now, and I want to speak to this because it is something we must address. This has been a silent killer for far too long.  I don't know a person who I have ever met who doesn't know somebody in their immediate family, extended family, or close friends who has not been affected by either prescription drug abuse or illicit drug use. With that, here we are.  I rise with my colleagues who have been coming down--they will be coming the rest of the day--to bring attention to this national crisis that is devastating every community. Many of the Senators you are going to hear from--and have already heard from--are from States that are dealing with an increase in this opiate abuse, just like my State of West Just like I have, they have heard from families, community leaders who are on the front lines. They are begging for solutions, funding, and they need facilities to properly combat the scourge we have right now.  Let me say to everybody who is watching, everybody who is listening in any way, shape, or form that you are hearing this: 20 years, 30 years ago, I was as guilty as everybody in the public policy arena in government, in my State government in West If you fooled with drugs back then, we thought, well, we will put you in prison; you committed a crime. Well, guess what. We have been putting them away for 20, 30 years, and we never cured a single soul.  Finally, we have come to the realization that addiction is an illness. Any other illness gets treatment. So we need treatment, but we don't have treatment centers. Budgets are tight.  I have a cousin who is a judge. Every day he says: Joe, I sentence people for the crimes they commit every day. He says: I have never had the first person say: Hey, Judge, we don't have a prison cell or a jail cell to put this person in. But if it happens once a day, it will happen 5 or 10 times a day, if I believe someone needs to get treatment because of their addiction, they will say: Well, Judge, I am sorry. We have no place to put them. We have no treatment centers. We will find a jail cell for you, but we will not find a treatment center because we don't have them.  The States don't have the money. Counties don't have the money. Municipalities don't have the money. The Federal Government has never dedicated enough money for this. So we keep talking about everything that happens.  Last year, over 800 West Virginians died of prescription drug abuse. They died of abuse from prescription drugs, and everyone says: Well, how do people get started? I don't know. Most of them have done heavy work in West We do mining and manufacturing. That is heavy work, and sometimes they get hurt.  I am going to read a letter later--I do every week try to come down to put real families, real faces, for you all to understand that this is a real issue.  When I have said this is a silent killer, we never talk about it. If you have somebody addicted in your family, you are kind of ashamed of it. You don't want anybody to know because they think that something is wrong with your family if someone has an addiction. They try to take care of themselves and they can't and that person doesn't get the help they need.  So when you look back at the use and the lack of a treatment, let me just tell you about the epidemic we are dealing with. Any other epidemic of this sort--and knowing it is an illness, it can be called a pandemic. Remember the Ebola concerns we had. All of the different things we were concerned about that could turn into a pandemic, we acted immediately. Well, we haven't acted immediately on this. We have had over 200,000 West Virginians die since the turn of the century. That is unbelievable, and to not do anything about it and keep our mouths shut, we have done that for far too long.  Today, 2.1 million Americans abuse or depend on their opiates. According to the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, three out of four new heroin users abuse prescription opiates before moving to heroin. I am told they move to heroin because it is cheaper, but they have already been hooked and addicted. Most of them got hooked and addicted on legal prescription drugs. That means there was some doctor who said: Here is something that is really going to help you, and they write that prescription. They think everything in a bottle is going to heal you.  In the United States of America, less than 5 percent of the world population--7.2 billion people live on planet Earth, less than 330 million in this country--4.6 percent of the world population consumes 80 percent of all the opiates produced and consumed in the world. What in the world happened to us? How did we become so pain-intolerant? How did we become so addicted?  Between 2009 and 2013, only 22 percent of Americans suffering from opiate addiction participated in any form of addiction treatment, and more and more people go without treatment every day.  Misuse and abuse of opiates cost the country an estimated $78.5 billion in 2013 just in lost productivity. So for those people who don't have compassion, don't think we should be doing these things, and you only look at the bottom line, if you are going to the bottom line, look at this bottom line: $78 billion of lost productivity, medical costs, and criminal costs.[[Page S3177]]  Talk to any of your law enforcement in any community you live in and ask them: Of all the calls you have gone on, how many have you gone on that are drug-related? A minimum of 80 to 90 percent of everything that they are called in, any type of assistance, any type of a crime that is committed, it is because of drugs. Some form of drugs are involved for our police. So think about what they are doing and how it takes them away from protecting the law-abiding citizens.  I have a bill called--and we will talk about treatment--it is I am still waiting for some of my friends and fellow colleagues on the Republican side to look at this bill very seriously. All I am asking for is one penny to charge the pharmaceutical manufacturers--one penny per milligram--that will go toward treatment centers throughout America, and every State needs them.  That one penny, they said: That is a new tax. We can't vote for a new tax. I said: Wait a minute. This opiate arena is pretty profitable, and we are not going to charge people whom opiates were designed for, which are people with severe illnesses, cancer patients. Basically, this is just for opiates, no other pharmaceutical products, just opiates. That is $1.5 to $2 billion a year. Can you believe that? That one penny.  Now, when they tell me, I am not going to vote for any new tax. I say: Well, you didn't hesitate to vote for a tobacco tax. You didn't hesitate to vote for an alcohol tax.  We have more people dying of this than anything else, and I am asking for a treatment plan. I can't get one penny, not one penny.  So I am asking for everyone to consider it. I truly believe no one would lose their election over voting to fund treatment centers for people who are desperately in need. That is the LifeBOAT  I want to read you a letter, and I do this every week. It is just heartbreaking, these letters, but it shows real people's lives, and it shows what it has done to their lives.  This letter is from Shadd He writes:  My name is Shadd Baisden, and I am from Dingess, I am writing to tell you my story of opioid addiction. I am an out-of-work coal miner with 9 years' experience. I was injured in the mine in 2011. I was dragged down a belt line 200 feet and messed the disks in my back, the L5, S1 in my back. This was how my addiction got started.  I was prescribed painkillers and needed surgery but felt I was too young for that. I was out of work for a year when I decided to settle my compensation claim so I could return back to work. While I was injured, the mine I worked in shut down so I had no job to go back to. I had been on painkillers the whole time I was out of work, but I stopped being prescribed after my settlement.  So when he made his settlement, basically that went away, his healthcare on that. So he had no other way of getting prescribed medicine.  He continues:  I was buying them off the street just to ease my pain. In 2013, I started using oxycodone and could not stop. I even got my wife hooked on them.  I have three daughters--11, 10, and 3 years of age. My youngest wasn't born at the time. Our addiction became so bad that we would steal things from our family just to get the drugs. I lost my license to drive. I lost my two oldest daughters because of my addiction. That is when I knew I had to have serious help.  I sought counseling and treatment. I took parenting classes, and my wife and I worked our tails off to get our girls back. We have now been clean and sober for 3 years and have custody back of all three of our girls.  I am currently out of work but do lots of odd jobs in my area because I can't afford to get my license back, and the vehicle I own was vandalized 3 months ago because I gave an officer info on a dealer not far from my home, and somehow the dealer found out and beat the windows out of my car while I was working.  I thank God every day for helping me and my wife stay clean.  I thank you for everything you do for the people of West Virginia and hope my story helps someone. I may be out of work right now, but good things will come as long as we stay clean and positive.  Now, the conclusion of this is Shadd and his wife are perfect examples of the people we can help if we made it easier for people dealing with substance abuse to get treatment. Shadd and his wife are the people I am fighting for every day. I will continue to fight for the people and families and children who have lost their way and need our help, and I am not going to stop fighting until they get it.  Every one of you all probably have a story. Every one of our young people--our pages and everybody else, everyone in the audience, whoever it may be, younger people--have probably been approached to try something, have probably been approached in their own schools to try something: Well, this is no problem. It is the hip thing to do in school.  They have recreational marijuana. A lot of people tell me they get started by experimenting, and then it moves into different things.  I don't know what it is. We don't know what our body chemistry is made up of. We don't know why some people are addicted and some people don't get addicted, but we know opiates are extremely addictive. We know that. It affects you. The only thing I can tell you is, it is something we are going to continue to fight. We are going to make people aware. We are starting education classes.  The United States of America should start educating in every class from preschool, kindergarten--you are not too young to know what this can do to you--all the way up through adulthood. We have to prevent people from getting on these horrific drugs that are killing people. Then we have to treat the people who are addicted and get them back into the workforce.  I ask all of you--and the concern we have, and I know in your beautiful State you have the same challenges we do. We all do. We are willing to fight together. This is a bipartisan effort. This is not one side and the other side taking credit or one side blaming the other side. This is one that we have to rise up as Americans--forget about Democrats and Republicans--and fight this. The U.Congress is responsible for fighting it and helping the people all over our country.  I yield the floor to my good friend from West  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sasse).

623,topic-id,561,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I am not an attorney either, Mr.I am a physician. As a matter of fact, I am an obstetrician. I think, of all the professions impacted by malpractice issues, perhaps, Mr.Speaker, obstetricians have been the most impacted.  I remember going back as a medical student and trying to figure out what type of doctor I wanted to become. My wife and I were blessed somewhere in there to have our first child. I remember when that little girl was given to me and I heard her cry, it was maybe the greatest single moment of my life.  As a young medical student, I was very impressed and said: That is what I want to do. I want to bring babies into the world and have that moment when I get to give a baby to a mom and she looks at that baby and it is just a very special moment. It is just the most agape love I have ever seen, a mom with a perfect heart towards that little baby. I wanted to do that.  So I started telling my professors I wanted to be an obstetrician. Every professor I met said: Don't do it. You are going to get sued. Malpractice prices are screaming. You are not going to like that job anymore. No one wants to go into obstetrics.  Well, guess what? My professors were right. I did it anyway.  The average obstetrician gets sued between three and four times in their career. Malpractice remains the biggest deterrent of physicians choosing to go into obstetrics. The average obstetrician has to spend 2 to 3 months every year just to pay for their malpractice insurance.  I am very blessed. Over 20 years ago, Kansas undertook similar tort reform as this, and our malpractice costs have stabilized. My malpractice insurance was pretty much the same 20 years after we enacted the legislation to curb some of these costs.  I think it will be true for me to say that my friends that are obstetricians in other States without malpractice tort reform, their premiums are often three times higher than ours in We have seen this work very, very well in The good news is that this legislation will not impact any of that work as well.  I very much am in favor of this malpractice tort reform and how it is going to impact healthcare. I predict that this will help lower premium costs some 3 to 4 percent when enacted.  Malpractice is a huge cost of the current cost of healthcare. This is a first step of many that Republicans are encouraging or want to implement to start lowering those costs of premiums.  Small Business Association members were here in D.just 2 months ago. When they walked out of that meeting, I was expecting them to come back and tell me their concerns were mostly regulatory concerns, but their number one concern was the cost of healthcare premiums.  This is a small step. If we can lower their healthcare costs 3 to 4 percent, this is a great, great opportunity for us to help them out.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to support this bill. I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to support this bill. It should be bipartisan support for this legislation that will help drive healthcare costs down.

We ought to want the Senate to be able to accomplish its work. It is a challenge all the time but learning what transpired this morning on the Senate floor, in my view, reaches another low for the  It is hard to explain, but it takes unanimous consent for committees to meet while the Senate is in session, and that is a request that is made on an ongoing basis when the Senate convenes, and it happened again this morning. Almost without exception, it is routine. The rules require that 2 hours after the Senate convenes, no committee can then meet unless there is agreement. So the majority leader today requested that the unanimous consent be granted, just like in almost every other day in the Senate, but what was different today was an objection was raised by the minority whip, and apparently the explanation is it is because of the firing of the Director of the FBI last night.  Now, how the Senate is functioning or not functioning seems to me to be unrelated to what transpired last night relating to the Director of the So in this place, where we are trying to do the people's work and make decisions and do good for America, the spillover over partisan politics, the spillover about playing a political game, highlighting a point has now caused the Senate to not be able to conduct hearings today. In fact, the minority Members of the Senate were instructed, requested, on their own volition--all left the hearings that were already being conducted this morning in protest over what transpired last night.  I am of a view that this is a diverse country. I am of a view that people of the U.Senate represent folks from across the country with different philosophies, different political parties, different people, different backgrounds. We all bring to the Senate a set of characteristics that are different, one from another, but I have great regard and respect for every Senator's point of view, and I would say that every Senator ought to have the ability to express their views on behalf of their constituents, but we can only do that if we allow the Senate to function.  I was on the Senate floor not long ago praising the fact that we finally were successful in the appropriations process; that we passed the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bill. For too long, the appropriations process has been broken down, and we have conducted business in the United States by continuing resolution. I thought we were back on a path in which there was enough agreement, respect among Members, enough setting aside of partisan differences to actually accomplish legislation. I was pleased that we did that, but today we fall back into the pattern of when something happens we want to make a political point. We then obstruct the ability of others in the Senate to conduct their work, to express their opinion, to gather the information they need.  This came to my attention--what transpired today--because this afternoon at 2:30 was scheduled a hearing by the Senate Veterans' Affairs That hearing has absolutely nothing to do with the We have the new Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs scheduled to testify about the Department's plan for modifications to a program called Choice that is important to me, my constituents, and to the veterans of I was so pleased the hearing had been scheduled, and I was looking forward to the questioning and having a conversation with the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs about how to make this system of Choice work for veterans who live in Kansas, from the rural side of our State to the suburban and urban side of our State, but because of a pique of anger, political posturing, and partisanship, the hearing is apparently no longer able to take place. The hearing this morning, which could only last for an hour and a half and which I guess the minority members walked out--seemed to me, at least sounded like, to be things that would be very important for us to pursue.  The Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities was to have a closed briefing this morning. The Homeland Security Committee was to examine cyber threats facing America, focusing on an overview of the cyber threat landscape. The list is significant in the things that we ought to be paying attention to, and yet, because of an objection, those hearings will not take place or were shortened or disrupted by only one party's participation.  I am not here trying to create further partisanship between Republicans and I am here trying to remind ourselves that there is value in allowing cooperation between the minority and majority, not for our own benefits but for the benefit of the country and the citizens we represent. Everything does not have to be partisan. Everything does not have to be political.  Today we see the Senate sliding back into the habit of making things that we have really nothing to do with and weren't the cause of taking place--apparently to make a political point and perhaps to score votes for support in a political way. We ought to all, as U.Senators, respect the opinions, values, and the positions of others, but we do that in a setting in which we all come together, not in which we cancel meetings as a result of a political statement.  I appreciate the opportunity to express my concerns about what has transpired and to ask for us to go back to the time in which we worked together on a daily basis and we don't use an excuse to shut down the committee hearing process.

523,topic-id,1916,"Madam President, I am here to visit about the topic of healthcare. I will be spending time in Kansas this week, and there probably will be no topic of conversation that will be greater than people's concerns about healthcare. I will tell you, as I have indicated to many of my colleagues, this is like no other issue I have ever dealt with as an elected official in how personal the consequences are of the decisions we make here.  While I certainly admit there is plenty of politics and partisanship and too much back and forth that revolves around this concern about healthcare, what I do know is, the people who visit with me, in so many instances, are my friends, my neighbors, our kids' teachers, they are people I go to church with, and in many instances, as they have a conversation with me about what we are going to do in regard to healthcare, tears begin to stream down their cheeks as they worry about themselves but, more importantly, they worry about their family members, their sons, daughters, husbands, wives, and parents.  This is a very personal issue. The concerns Kansans have about this and what we might do is sincere and real. I also know the Affordable Care Act--the law that is in existence today--is failing many Americans as well. In fact, just this week, yesterday, we learned the company Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is exiting the market and will no longer provide a product in the Kansas City area of our State, which means, in most instances, individuals will no longer have an option in regard to the Affordable Care  What we have in place doesn't work, but I also know what has come from the House isn't the solution to this problem either. The work we have to do--you and I, Madam President, and our colleagues--is serious and one that has real and personal consequences for every American, and we must take our responsibilities seriously.  I have indicated to my colleagues that neither the Affordable Care Act, which I voted against, nor what the House has passed, is anything I would vote for. I really wish we were doing something different than either one of those things.  As I thought about my remarks today, I was about to say that I suppose I came too late to get my ideas adopted by Congress, but really I came to this issue early, and I think it was 2004, maybe 2006, in which, at least in my own mind, I penned on paper and worked on drafting legislation on what I called a 10-point plan to address the affordability and availability of healthcare.  I can tell you that my ideas, which predate President Obama's, were nothing like the Affordable Care Act, and they really were nothing like the conversation we are having today. I wish we would be addressing the underlying reasons that healthcare costs so much rather than focusing so much attention on the issue of health insurance and its premiums.  If we can drive the things out of healthcare that unnecessarily raise the price, the cost of access to healthcare, we can make a tremendous difference in healthcare premiums and the affordability of healthcare for all Americans, not just trying to figure out what kind of plan we can develop, what kind of insurance program, what kind of subsidy or tax credit we can provide, but we would be treating the underlying problem, not just the symptoms.  I suppose, to give a little understanding of what I am talking about, in my view, the things we ought to consider are allowing more competition in the market, more free enterprise opportunities, allowing people to purchase insurance from coast to coast, expanding the support for community health centers. These centers are already in existence. They need to be more available in more places.  We are a very rural State, and it is hard to find those community health centers, but they provide healthcare services to people who have no ability to pay and no insurance. We ought to be more supportive of community health centers, not less, providing, particularly, primary care for people in difficult circumstances.  We also need to give small businesses and organizations the ability to organize and create larger pools so they can negotiate for better premiums. We need to utilize health savings accounts. We need to support medical research. If we can find a cure for cancer, the delay of the onset of Alzheimer's, we can save billions of dollars in our healthcare system as well as save lives and improve the quality of life of people who suffer from the diseases that are so prevalent.  We need to address the issue of prescription drug costs. How do we make certain no drug company takes advantage of cornering the market or how do we make certain they don't utilize our current laws to extend the life of their patent, eliminating the chance for competition to come into play and the introduction of generic medicine that can save, again, consumers and patients lots of money.  We need to promote preventive healthcare. Wellness, fitness, diet, and nutrition are the things that probably give us the biggest bang for our buck and don't necessarily need to be a government program, but people need to work at living healthier and healthier lives and prevent diseases from occurring in the first place.  We need additional physicians and other healthcare providers--nurses and others--and we have not put the attention into developing programs to educate and train the next generation of medical providers. We need to make sure Medicare and Medicaid actually[[Page S3172]]pay for the cost of the services they promised to pay for on behalf of low-income citizens as well as citizens who are seniors, instead of having the cost shifting that occurs as a result of the system we have today, in which Medicare doesn't pay or Medicaid doesn't pay sufficient amounts of money to actually pay for the services a patient receives under either one of those programs.  Again, those are things that I think would be beneficial to every American, and it wouldn't be spending our time trying to figure out how we modify the insurance system, how we figure out about subsidies or tax credits for people within the system. Again, I don't come late to this issue, but it doesn't seem to be the direction we are going.  Before my time expires, one of the items I wanted to particularly highlight is the value of medical research. I am proud this Congress passed an appropriations bill that includes an additional $2 billion for use in medical research for the National Institutes of Health, and perhaps something that we can even be additionally proud of is, we did that without spending more money. We simply--I shouldn't say ``simply.'' Nothing is easy about it. I am on the Appropriations subcommittee that is responsible for the funding of We reallocated money that was being spent someplace else in support of medical research. Again, if we find the cure for cancer, if we reduce the onset, the time in which people suffer from Alzheimer's, if we can find the cure for diabetes and other diseases, the lifesaving changes that are being made through that medical research and the costs that will accrue to our healthcare delivery system are hugely important.  I particularly commend the Director of the National Institutes of Health for working so closely with Members of Congress and the American people in support of medical research. Francis Collins is a national resource. I am not a scientist. I don't understand all the concepts that are spoken about when we talk about medical research--a long shot from that. One of the things Collins, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, has been able to do is explain to me and to my colleagues and to others across the country the value of medical research without getting me lost in the details of the actual science. He is someone who can talk to a layperson about medical research and science in a way that captures me, captures my attention, but I don't get lost in the medical or technical or scientific words and jargon that so often scientists use in having the conversations.  Collins has been so bipartisan in his approach. I smiled when I read the story. He indicated that when he was being chosen to be the Director of the National Institutes of Health, he called his mother back home and indicated to her: Mom, I am going to become the Director of the National Institutes of  She said: But we are I don't want you working for government.  Here is a man who has used his time not working for government, perhaps working in government, but working for the American people and really for worldwide solutions to problems we all face in our families.  There is no American, there is no one in this Chamber whose family has not been affected by the diseases I described and the other long list of afflictions we have as human beings that NIH is not working to make a difference in their lives.  We need to continue that support for the National Institutes of Health as we pursue appropriations bills into the future, and our ability to do that together is important and a source of satisfaction that can come.  I have indicated, from time to time, that it is sometimes difficult to find the things in the jobs that we have as U.Senators where you get the sense of accomplishment. There are a lot of challenges in getting things done, but the idea that we have come together to support medical research and find lifesaving cures gives us something to take great satisfaction in and gives us hope that what we have been able to accomplish in this regard, as Republicans and Democrats but really as Americans, can be a role model as we try to find solutions to other problems. I hope that will be the case as we try to find solutions with regard to how do we care for the American people when it comes to their affordability and availability of healthcare.  You and I, Madam President, come from States that are very rural. In any kind of healthcare solution that we find, we need to make certain we are increasing the chances that hospital doors remain open in rural communities across our States, and we need to make certain there are more physicians, not less, there are more healthcare providers, that nursing home and healthcare services are more available, and that pharmacy remains on Main  In fact, in the cases of our States, you could find ways, I suppose, that reduce the cost of healthcare only to discover that you no longer have a provider, no longer have a hospital or a physician or a pharmacy in your hometown. Sometimes when you talk about the affordability, you must quickly couple that with availability. Whatever its price is, if it is not in your community, if it is not in your county, if it is not in your region of the State, it doesn't necessarily matter what it costs.  Our work is serious, and I look forward to working with you and my colleagues as we try to find solutions to make certain healthcare is something every American has access to.  I yield the floor.

522,topic-id,2529,"Madam President, I rise to speak on the same subject as my friend from  Listen, Democrats are ready to talk to Republicans about improving our healthcare system, but we aren't going to engage in a debate that presupposes that the end result is going to be millions of people losing care and rates going up for everybody in order to fund a tax cut for the wealthy. That is the plan Donald Trump and the Republicans are pushing.  So my Republican friend is right: Democrats are not interested in having a discussion about how many people are going to lose coverage. We are not interested in having a discussion about how high the rate increases are going to be. We are not interested in having a discussion about big tax breaks for millionaires, billionaires, insurance companies, and drug companies.  Let's be honest. If Republicans were serious about working with Democrats, we wouldn't be using an arcane Senate rule which allows them to push through a bill with 50 votes. If Republicans really wanted to work with Democrats on healthcare reform, they would do it through normal business. If Republicans were really serious about working with Democrats on healthcare reform, they would be going through regular order and going through the committee process.  Whatever we want to think about the Affordable Care Act, it went through the committee process. I think 160 Republican amendments were accepted in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in 2009. The Finance Committee held multiple meetings. The bill was on the floor of the Senate for a month. Republicans are jamming this bill through--no committee process, no committee meetings, no committee markups, no open-floor process.  Even Senator Corker called out his own party and said that this is no way to rewrite one-sixth of the American economy--13 male Republican Senators, behind closed doors, in secret.  Democrats are desperate to work with Republicans on fixing what is wrong with our healthcare system. Not every problem has been fixed, but we are not going to start with 17 million people losing healthcare or rates going up by 20 percent. And we want to do it in a way that is transparent to the American public, where everybody can see.  On the second point my friend from Texas raised--this idea that CBO got the numbers wrong when they estimated how many people would be insured by the Affordable Care Act in 2009--as he mentioned, they weren't off by that much, but to the extent they were off, there is a simple reason for it: CBO did not take into account that Republican States would seek to undermine the Affordable Care Act in every conceivable way possible. CBO gave Republican Governors and State legislatures the benefit of the doubt that once this law was passed, once it was presenting an avenue to insurance for millions of people across the country, both parties would seek to implement it. That is not what happened. Republican States refused to set up State-based exchanges. Republicans brought lawsuit after lawsuit to try to stop the Affordable Care Act from going forward. Republicans, in control of the House and the Senate, jammed through legislation that reduced the risk insurance provided to insurance companies. CBO did not estimate that Republicans would wage a 6-year-long campaign to undermine and undo the Affordable Care  In States that implemented the act, such as Connecticut, numbers met or beat expectations. In States that didn't[[Page S3170]]implement the Affordable Care Act, sought to undermine it, numbers didn't meet the expectations.  Then comes President Trump, who openly telegraphs his desire to undermine the Affordable Care Act, cuts off all of the advertising, tells the IRS to stop enforcing the law, bleeds out payments to insurance companies one month at a time, teasing that this will be the last month they get their money.  Finally, on this question of a gun to the head of consumers--I guess that is a reference to the provision of the Affordable Care Act that says: If you don't buy insurance, then you will pay a penalty. That is absolutely part of the Affordable Care Why? Because if you want protection for people with preexisting conditions, then you have to have a mandate that people buy insurance, or else people just won't buy insurance until they are really sick, knowing they can't be charged more.  Actuarially, the protection for people with preexisting conditions only works with the individual mandate. I remember Senator Cruz, during his marathon filibuster, admitting that. Republicans and Democrats know that. That is why the American Health Care Act, which just came out of the House of Representatives, includes an individual mandate. So let's not pretend like this is a partisan issue.  The rightwing American Health Care Act that came out of the House of Representatives 2 weeks ago includes an individual mandate--it is in there--because they know the same thing: If they want to preserve any modicum of protection for people with preexisting conditions, they have to require people to buy insurance. They just put the mandate in a different place. In the Affordable Care Act, the penalty kicks in if you don't buy insurance. In the House bill, the penalty kicks in after you have lost insurance and you try to sign up again. It is the same mandate, the same penalty, just a slightly different timetable for payment.  Here is what TrumpCare does: higher costs, less care, tax cuts for the rich.  I want to talk about the CBO score that came out last night--not major adjustments from the first CBO score, but there are some important amendments that they make. But the bottom line is that if you care about costs, there are going to be higher costs. That is what CBO says. There is a 20-percent increase in cost the first year, 5 percent in the next year for good measure. There is less care--I mean significantly less care--23 million people. Big improvement--24 million people lost care in the first House bill; 23 million people lose care in the second House bill. And all of this is done in order to pass along tax cuts to the wealthy. We are talking about $662 billion of tax cuts for the wealthy.  Here is what CBO says: Premiums are projected to rise 20 percent in 2018. So our Republican friends who came down to this floor for 6 years and said we need to repeal the Affordable Care Act because costs are too high just passed a bill in the House of Representatives that CBO guarantees will raise premiums by 20 percent in 2018.  And it got a lot worse. CBO says that if you are an individual with a preexisting condition and you live in a State that takes advantage of one of these waivers, the premiums, frankly, don't even matter to you because you won't be able to afford the catastrophic high cost associated with your illness.  If you are an older American, especially an older American living on Social Security, then you are targeted by the American Health Care A 64-year-old making $26,000--and I have a lot of 64-year-olds in Connecticut making $26,000, and I bet a lot of my colleagues here who live in lower cost and lower income States have even more of this population--today you are paying about $1,700 a year for healthcare. That is what your premium is after taxes. Under the American Health Care Act, your premium would go up to $21,000 a year. You are making $26,000, and your premium goes up to $21,000. You would receive about $5,000 in tax credits, but in the end, you would be paying $16,000 in healthcare premiums.  Now, obviously you wouldn't be paying $16,000 in insurance premiums because you couldn't afford healthcare if you still want to pay your rent and you still want to pay your gas bill and you still want a few groceries.  The reason why massive numbers of people lose insurance is because 20 percent is just the average; for some people, premiums will go up 700 to 800 percent, especially if you are older or if you are lower income.  Here is what CBO says will happen if the Affordable Care Act stays: The number of uninsured will go up a little bit. It will tick up to about 28 million. But for all my colleagues on the Republican side who have been claiming that the Affordable Care Act is in a ``death spiral,'' CBO tells you that you are wrong. You are wrong. They state clearly that the marketplaces will remain stable. Now, again, they may not be counting on the kind of sabotage President Trump is engaged in. If President Trump continues to destabilize the markets, maybe this number will be wrong. But if you had an administration that was attempting to enforce and implement the Affordable Care Act, you would get about the same number of people who are uninsured.  Here is what happens if you pass the American Health Care Act: The number goes immediately up to over 40 million uninsured and peaks after 10 years at 51 million people.  Senator Cornyn said: Listen, we still have 30 million people who don't have insurance; let's try to solve that problem. But CBO says that the House bill doesn't solve the problem. It turns a problem of 28 million Americans without health insurance into a humanitarian catastrophe--more people uninsured at the end of this than were uninsured before the Affordable Care Act passed.  So I guess what Senator Cornyn is saying is that whatever product emerges from these secret meetings will insure more people and that CBO will verify that. That is something on which we can work together. Let me guarantee, that won't be the case.  To give a sense of how many people 23 million is, because I know that is kind of a hard number to get your head wrapped around, this is the number of people who lose insurance under the House bill, according to CBO's new numbers just came out last night. That is the equivalent population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, South Dakota, Rhode Island, North Dakota, and West When we put up this chart a couple months ago, I think there was one additional So by moving from 24 million losing insurance to 23 million people losing insurance, one State came off this list. But that is the equivalent population of how many folks lose healthcare in this country. That is why I call it a humanitarian catastrophe.  Then let's just think about what CBO says about who benefits. Here are 23 million people who lose insurance--and that is a pretty simple formula. The bill takes insurance from 23 million people in order to pass along a $173 billion tax break for the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry and a $230 billion tax break for very rich people. Some of it will go to people making above $200,000 a year, but most of it will go to people making over $1 million or $1 billion a year. The numbers actually work out pretty squarely. The cuts to healthcare in the bill roughly work out to be about the same amount in tax cuts for the wealthy.  By the way, there is another chart here that is a great one. There is another chart that shows who benefits when we look at the tax breaks. If you make under $200,000 a year, you get zero benefit from the American Health Care Every single dime of the tax cuts for individuals or families goes to those making over $200,000 a year. How about that--a $230 billion tax break, and not a dime of it goes to people making under $200,000 a year. So this bill was a nightmare before the CBO score, and it is even more of a nightmare today.  Let me point out one more important thing that CBO says about this bill. Inside this bill, in a new amendment that allowed it to pass the House of Representatives, is a provision that allows States to get waivers from the essential healthcare benefits requirement that insurance actually provide you coverage for healthcare and the community rating requirement that you spread out the costs of healthcare across the entire population of people who are insured.[[Page S3171]]  What CBO says is that about one-sixth of the population--that is equivalent to about 25 States and Washington, DC--who might obtain waivers, including both the essential benefits requirement and the community rating benefit--that would result in insurance markets coming apart at the beginning of 2020.  CBO states that ``less healthy people would face extremely high premiums, despite the additional funding that would be available'' under the bill to reduce premiums. CBO says specifically: ``In particular, out-of-pocket spending on maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year for the nongroup enrollees who would use those services.''  Let me put a finer point on this. The legislative jujitsu that Republicans did in the House to get this thing passed involved eliminating the requirement that people with preexisting conditions be protected from premium increases, combined with a high-risk pool that would have a bunch of money in it to help reduce premiums for those people.  CBO tells you essentially that those high-risk pools are a fraud. CBO says there is not enough money in the high-risk pools in order to provide any meaningful benefit for people with preexisting conditions. In particular, they say, women going through pregnancy, families going through pregnancy, and individuals with mental health and substance abuse will see thousands of dollars in additional costs because the money in the risk pools cannot cover the cost of that care.  We have an opioid epidemic raging throughout this country, and the House just passed a bill that will increase costs for people suffering from substance abuse by thousands of dollars. We can do better. Republicans can emerge from these secret meetings, set aside their plan to ram through this vote with no committee process through reconciliation, and we can start talking about what to preserve in the Affordable Care Act and what we need to change. That is what Americans want us to do.  The majority of Americans do not want this bill repealed. The majority of Americans today support the Affordable Care Yes, that number is different than what it was a few years ago. Maybe that is because, faced with this benefit, faced with these insurance protections being eliminated, Americans are rallying to the defense of the Affordable Care That doesn't mean Democrats don't believe we can make some commonsense amendments, but it does mean we are not willing to participate in a process that presupposes that the outcome will be less people being insured, costs getting higher in order to finance tax breaks for the very wealthy and for insurance companies and drug companies.  Republicans should come out from behind closed doors, work with CBO tells you a humanitarian catastrophe is coming if you don't.  I yield the floor.

TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, would be cut by $21 billion. In 2014, 20 percent of the population of my district, the Virgin Islands, received SNAP feeds primarily poor children.

The supporters of this bill point to its consideration in previous Congresses for hearings, but we have over 50 new Members who didn't hear a word about this bill from any experts before it was rushed to the floor.  We are considering this bill under a very restrictive rule. That means there were 24 amendments filed. This rule only allows the House to debate and vote on five of them. That means 19 of them, amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans, were simply just tossed out in the Rules That is what this rule does.  If this rule were to pass, it would mean that the efforts of 19 Members to offer ideas to improve healthcare wouldn't even be allowed to be debated or voted upon here on the floor of this It is no coincidence that eight amendments filed by Democrats, and not one Democratic amendment was made in order. Only 5 out of 24 ideas from Democrats and Republicans were made in order.  One amendment filed by my colleague, Representative Jackson Lee, would have provided an exception to the bill for any medical-related injury to a child, which seems like common sense. At least have a debate about it. If people disagree, let them disagree. Let's have a vote.  This rule continues this very closed process, where Democrats and Republicans are shut out of participating in the bills that appear fully formed without the opportunity for us to represent our districts and offer amendments to improve and make these bills better, to reduce costs, to improve the quality of care.  What I wonder, Mr.Speaker, is: Where is the open process promised by Speaker Ryan? This Congress hasn't even considered a single piece of legislation under an open rule, and we have had many, many bills brought to the floor under closed rules and without any committee hearings. But, you know, I am beginning to not be surprised so much anymore because secretiveness seems to be the standard that Republicans are setting in this  How the Republicans have handled their healthcare bill from start through now is a perfect example of the closed-door, secretive process that has become, tragically, the standard operating procedure for this  The Republican healthcare bill will increase healthcare costs, provide less coverage--22 million fewer people will be covered--increase costs for those who are lucky enough to keep their current coverage, and reduce access to healthcare for the American people. It puts a burden on small businesses, on the middle class, on rural healthcare providers, while handing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to big corporations and special interests.  TrumpCare is a billionaire's tax cut disguised as a healthcare bill, and it will be one of the largest transfers of wealth from the middle class and the working families to the top 1 percent of Effectively, it is removing benefits from people in rural counties and cities across our country and giving those tax cuts mostly to people in New York and That is what Republicans are delivering with this bill.  When the American people were finally given the chance to see the Senate's healthcare legislation, the American people overwhelmingly rejected it. Only 16 percent of the American people approve of the plan. Democrats oppose it; Republicans oppose it; independents oppose it.  The Congressional Budget Office's recent score of the bill says that coverage will significantly decrease under this bill and that the costs of deductibles for patients will go up. Patients will have to spend more out of pocket, those that are lucky enough to even have insurance after this cruel bill.  But there is still time to stop it, and I call upon my colleagues to prevent this bill from moving forward.  The bill that Republicans are trying to ram through Congress is not truly meant to make improvements to our healthcare system but to take money away from the middle class and working families and put it into the pockets of a very few people who benefit from the tax cuts under this bill: for people making millions of dollars a year.  This bill makes it harder for middle-income families and for low-income families to access quality, affordable healthcare, makes it harder for individuals who have preexisting conditions or have genetic disorders or long-term diseases from accessing lifesaving medical attention, and cuts critical healthcare services for disabled children in schools that many of our school districts rely on. And they want to do this all with a closed process.  I offered three amendments to improve healthcare in our Education and the Workforce All were defeated on a partisan vote.                              {time}  1245  Every Republican voted not to allow those. No Democrat, as far as I know--certainly not me--has been invited to present our ideas to Republican leadership or President  Democrats have lots of ideas to improve the Affordable Care I am sure many Republicans do, too. Those ideas are not reflected whatsoever in this bill or in the closed process that prohibits Republicans and Democrats from even offering our suggestions to improve this bill.  So, here we are, debating another piece of healthcare legislation that did not go through an open process. Democrats were shut out of the amendment process completely.  This bill would make it more difficult for victims of medical malpractice to seek or receive compensation for their injuries. It is inconsistent with the 10th Amendment, which reserves these rights to the States that are not enumerated in the[[Page H5195]]Constitution, and unlike the Democrats' approach to medical malpractice reform in the Affordable Care Act, which provided funding for pilot programs in the States to reduce the risk of medical malpractice liability consistent with the 10th Many constitutional experts--I would add, many conservative constitutional experts--believe that this approach is unconstitutional because of the 10th  We have learned that this bill does not actually protect access to healthcare but, instead, undermines a State-based tort system, making it more difficult for patients to be compensated from bad actors.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by over 60 national and State organizations opposed to H.1215.                                                    June 12, 2017.

This bill would limit the legal rights of      injured patients and families of those killed by negligent      health care. The bill's sweeping scope covers not only cases      involving medical malpractice, but also cases involving      unsafe drugs and nursing home abuse and neglect.       Even if H.1215 applied only to doctors and hospitals,      recent studies clearly establish that its provisions would      lead to more deaths and injuries, and increased health care      costs due to a ``broad relaxation of care.'' Add to this      nursing home and pharmaceutical industry liability      limitations, significantly weakening incentives for these      industries to act safely, and untold numbers of additional      death, injuries and costs are inevitable, and unacceptable.       The latest statistics show that medical errors, most of      which are preventable, are the third leading cause of death      in This intolerable situation is perhaps all the      more shocking because we already know about how to fix much      of this problem. Congress should focus on improving patient      safety and reducing deaths and injuries, not insulating      negligent providers from accountability, harming patients and      saddling taxpayers with the cost, as H.1215 would do.       For example, this bill would establish a permanent across-     the-board $250,000 ``cap'' on compensation for ``non-economic      damages'' in medical malpractice cases. Such caps are unfair      and discriminatory. For example, University of Buffalo Law      Professor Lucinda Finley has written, ``certain injuries that      happen primarily to women are compensated predominantly or      almost exclusively through noneconomic loss damages. These      injuries include sexual or reproductive harm, pregnancy loss,      and sexual assault injuries.'' Also, ``[J]uries consistently      award women more in noneconomic loss damages than men . . .      [A]ny cap on noneconomic loss damages will deprive women of a      much greater proportion and amount of a jury award than men.      Noneconomic loss damage caps therefore amount to a form of      discrimination against women and contribute to unequal access      to justice or fair compensation for women.''       Other provisions in H.1215 are just as problematic. The      proposed federal statute of limitations, more restrictive      than a majority of state laws, lacks complete logic from a      deficit reduction angle since its only impact would be to cut      off meritorious claims, forcing patients to turn to the      government for care. The bill would repeal joint and several      liability even though the Congressional Budget Office says      this could increase, not lower, costs.       H.1215 would overturn traditional state common law and      would be an unprecedented interference with the work of state      court judges and juries in civil cases. Its one-way      preemption of state law provisions that protect patients      (there are some exceptions) makes clear that the intent of      this legislation is not to make laws uniform in the 50      states. Rather, it is a carefully crafted bill to provide      relief and protections for the insurance, medical and drug      industries, at the expense of patient safety. We urge you to      oppose H.1215: The ``Protecting Access to Care Act of      2017.'' Thank you.

618,topic-id,632,"Some of the groups are the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association, Justice in Aging, Long Term Care Community Coalition, National Education Association, National Consumers League, National Disability Rights Network, Public Citizen, Public Justice, and many, many other great organizations.  I hope my friend from Colorado is a member of at least two or three of these wonderful organizations. I will furnish the entire list to him.  This bill preempts State tort law that has been developed over the last 200 years and is contrary to the 10th Amendment of our It imposes an arbitrary cap on the amount of noneconomic damages a victim can collect under a Federal law coopting the ability of States to do their own medical malpractice laws and hamstringing them with regard to the reforms that they can undertake.  In fact, capping damages also increases taxpayer spending. According to a joint study by Northwestern University and the University of Illinois, they found that capping economic damages actually increases Medicare part B spending.  I would point out another horrible feature of the cruel Republican healthcare bill is that it guts the Medicare trust fund and would lead to Medicare becoming insolvent sooner rather than later by draining the Medicare trust fund of over $100 billion. That is another aspect of this bill.  No wonder they didn't want us to see it, Mr.No wonder they kept it in a locked closet from even Republicans who were allegedly writing it, like Ken Buck and my friend, Senator Gardner, who was on the committee writing it and who later said he hadn't seen it. No wonder it was hidden, when you find out it actually leads to Medicare insolvency sooner, when you find that it throws 22 million people off the insurance that they already have, when you find out it raises rates for those who are lucky enough to maintain their insurance, when you find it takes money out of our schools, when you find that it risks throwing our elderly out of their nursing homes who rely on  This bill is a symptom of a problem. I am not a doctor; my friend from Colorado is not a doctor; but when I ask my doctor what you do when there are[[Page H5196]]symptoms, it is treat the underlying cause.  Let's do that. This bill doesn't do that. This Republican Senate bill that throws people off insurance doesn't do that. Let's begin a process where we get ideas from Democrats and Republicans to work together to reduce costs in healthcare, to expand coverage in healthcare, and to improve the quality of healthcare for American families.  This bill is not focused on protecting patients. It increases the risk to patients. It drains Medicare of additional money. This bill will not reduce costs to patients. In fact, no healthcare bill being debated in Congress right now actually improves patient care or reduces costs to patients.  Those should be two pillars, two goals of healthcare reform: Can we reduce costs, and can we improve patient care?  This bill risks making patient care worse in an unconstitutional way. The Senate bill actually will increase costs to patients, increase deductibles, make more people lose their insurance, make you pay more for insurance you already have if you are one of the people who is lucky enough not to lose it under the cruel Republican bill.  Instead of politicizing and polarizing access to healthcare--literally a life-and-death issue for American families--let's work together to find solutions that reduce costs, increase coverage, and improve care. The Senate Republican healthcare bill meets none of those three critical criteria that the American people demand in healthcare reform: reducing costs, increasing coverage, and improving the quality of care for ourselves and for our loved ones.

624,topic-id,393,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.McEachin).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I think a couple of points, before I get to the main portion of my remarks, that the manager of the bill threw out need to be addressed.  First of all, my wife is a prosecutor. I like prosecutors, but they are lawyers. I was a trial lawyer until December 31 of last year. Guess what? We sue drunk drivers. We sue for people who get hurt when it is not their own fault. I come from a State where contributory negligence is the law. So I appreciate the reverence you hold prosecutors in--I do, as well--but we are all lawyers.  I also want to point out that, while there may be people on the floor who are not lawyers, you can't honestly believe this bill gives you equal access to justice, and here is why: You have a cap on noneconomic damages. So a person who is injured by a doctor and a person who receives the exact same injuries from some other tort have two different recoveries that they can reach. One is capped; one is not. That is not equal justice, in my judgment, under the law.  In addition, you all are the pro-business party, yet you all want to get into how people contract with one another. I would suggest that is inconsistent with your pro-business approach.  Mr.Speaker, what this bill really underlies is a fundamental mistrust for our constituents. Think about it. Juries are made up of our constituents. What you are really worried about is that your constituents are not going to get it right when they are sitting in that jury box and making decisions.  Your constituents are wise enough to send me and 435 of us here to the Congress to make decisions about trillion-dollar budgets, yet you don't trust them to sit in the jury box and make the very important decisions for their fellow citizens when they are injured.  Mr.Speaker, I want to suggest that this bill clearly violates the spirit of the Seventh Amendment, the right to trial by jury, by putting these limitations on the jury, by putting limitations on access to justice.

643,topic-id,1141,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, when we think about healthcare, we all think about, of course, first and foremost, ourselves and our loved ones and our families. As Representatives of 750,000 people, we also think about constituents that we know, that we have met, for whom healthcare is literally a life-and-death situation.  I think of my friend Debbie and her son Debbie's son Sam was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was 4 years old. He is now 20 or 21 or so. He was a healthy kid, he ate healthy food, an active young child. As Debbie pointed out to me, it is not that anybody chooses an illness or a condition, the illness chooses you. Through the luck of the draw, her son Sam is afflicted with type 1 diabetes. Like many people with autoimmune diseases, it was not poor choices, it was not lifestyle decisions that gave him the disease or even increased his risk of the disease. He was dealt a bad hand with an autoimmune gene that his family didn't even know that they had.  Because of that, Sam has a costly disease. Thankfully, one that can be treated, if not cured, but he has a costly disease for the rest of his life. There is no cure, and the cost of insulin and other lifesaving technologies is very high.  Sam has what here in Washington people call a preexisting condition. That is what we are talking about. Without insurance, the cost per month would go from about $400, which Debbie and her husband are able to afford and put together for Sam, to $2,500 a month, which they could not possibly afford to do.  Sam is now 20, and because of the Affordable Care Act, he will be on the family's health insurance until he is 26. That is, if the family can keep their health insurance. The family worries, like so many others, that they might be one of those 22 million families that loses coverage under this Republican healthcare bill. It is a lot of families.  It is not going to be any of my colleagues' families. My colleagues have a government health insurance plan from serving in the House of Their congressional staff has access to the exchanges, just like we do, to buy insurance. But 22 million people in each and every one of our districts, 435 districts in this country, in each and every one of our districts, not dozens of people, not hundreds of people, but thousands of real people like Deb and Sam, like a story I shared earlier of Marcia and Grace, will actually lose their healthcare. They will be forced to give up their home, become insolvent, go bankrupt, or die. A choice that no American should have to face.  Mr.Speaker, the bill under consideration today is one of many that didn't go through regular order. There were no hearings. Closed process. They cut out all the Democratic amendments that we had to improve the bill. That is how the Republicans have been handling healthcare legislation this That is why this approach isn't working. It is why this approach is so unpopular. No hearings, shut Members out of the legislative process, bring a bill to the floor that was hidden in some closet, written in secret, widely unpopular, throwing people off healthcare insurance, raising rates for those who are luckily enough to keep their insurance.  This bill is not aimed at protecting patients. This bill before us and the Senate Republican healthcare bill make it more difficult for Americans to deal with real-life healthcare issues that were dealt over the course of life for ourselves and our families.  We need a reset, Mr.We need to reset and start real discussions about improving healthcare.  How could Democrats or Republicans work together to reduce costs?  Democrats and Republicans should work together to expand coverage. We shouldn't be talking about whether 22 million people lose coverage or 10 million people lose coverage or 5 million people lose coverage. Let's talk about 5 million people gaining coverage, 10 million people gaining coverage. Let's reset and frame the discussion about how more people can have access to healthcare.  The problem we are trying to solve is not how can we get less Americans to have access to healthcare. That is why this bill is so unpopular. If that is the problem Republicans are trying to solve, they solved it in this bill. Less Americans will have healthcare. But that is not the problem that the American people want us to address in  More people with healthcare, and people want to save money. They want their insurance rates to be lower, their deductibles to be lower. They want to save money. There are some low-hanging fruit in terms of costs in healthcare, administrative overhead, wasteful and duplicative spending, that we can go after together. These are good ideas, whether you are a Democrat or a  One of the amendments that I proposed was pricing transparency. One of the problems in the healthcare marketplace is nobody knows how much anybody charges. Different insurers and private payers pay widely different amounts for the exact same procedure. Let's at least disclose the pricing and have transparency so market mechanisms will work to pull down rates by promoting competition.                              {time}  1315  By not allowing the market into healthcare, we are creating inefficiencies and raising rates. Let's come together on that. Let's come together around a lot of good ideas that Democrats and Republicans have bills on and have amendments on. But, no, they are not even allowed to be debated and not even allowed to be voted on either on[[Page H5199]]this bill, in which every Democratic amendment was shut down, or in the Republican healthcare bill, in which no process was allowed for Democrats to improve the bill.  We have never even been invited into the secret backroom to figure out what was being debated. We didn't even see the bill until it was presented fully formed days before it had to be voted on, affecting the lives of 22 million Americans, one-eighth of our entire economy, without any hearings, without any expert testimony, and only days to digest this hundred-page bill.  So look, let's reset, let's work together to bring down costs, expanding coverage and improving quality, and create a work product in healthcare reform that we can be proud of as Republicans, as Democrats, and as Americans; one in which Debbie and her son, Sam, don't have to worry about giving up their home or facing death; or one in which Grace and her mother are able to live out their lives without worrying about their preexisting condition.

484,topic-id,635,"Mr.President, today, along with Senators Brown, Tester, Blumenthal, Kaine, Duckworth, Warren, Baldwin, Franken, Klobuchar, Cortez Masto, Van Hollen, and Menendez, I am reintroducing the Military Consumer Enforcement Act to further strengthen consumer protections for service members.  Our Nation has a strong tradition of working to protect our service members while they sacrifice to keep our Nation, safe. Building on these efforts, Congress passed the Soldiers' and Sailor's Civil Relief Act in 1940 to provide essential financial protections for service members to ``enable such persons to devote their entire energy to the defense needs of the Nation.'' Now called the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), this law provides such protections as prohibiting the eviction of service members and their dependents from rental or mortgaged properties and capping the interest at 6% on debts incurred prior to an individual entering active duty military service.  Despite the importance of the SCRA's protections to our service members, enforcement of this critical law has been inconsistent and subject to the discretion of our financial regulators. For example, according to a July 2012 report from the Government Accountability Office, the estimated percentage of depository institutions that serviced mortgages that were examined for SCRA compliance varied by year between 2007 through 2011 at a rate of 4% in 2007, 17% in 2008, 18% in 2009, 26% in 2010, and 15% in 2011. Without a change in the law, SCRA enforcement will continue to be subject to the changing priorities of the financial regulators, which can also change with each newly elected Simply put, prioritizing the consumer protection of our service members should not be discretionary; it should be mandatory. Our legislation ensures that SCRA enforcement will be a permanent priority for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, which Congress created to enforce Federal consumer financial protection laws.  In 2010, as we debated the authorizing legislation for the CFPB, I led the bipartisan effort to ensure the CFPB would play a key role in protecting service members through the establishment of an Office of Servicemember Affairs, Since that time, the CFPB, through its enforcement actions, has helped service members recover approximately $130 million in relief from unscrupulous actors in the financial marketplace and through the OSA's monitoring of complaints, the CFPB has helped other regulators provide more than $60 million in relief for more than 78,000 service members harmed by SCRA violations. Imagine how much more the CFPB could do for our service members if it could do more than just refer potential SCRA violations to other regulators and educate service members about their SCRA rights. With this demonstrated record of success in protecting our service members, the CFPB should be empowered, as it would be under this legislation, to enforce certain key SCRA provisions, such as the protections against default judgments and being charged no more than the maximum rate of interest on debts incurred before military service.  We should do all we can to make sure there is a strong watchdog on the beat that can enforce the protections we have put in place. When it comes to the SCRA, that strong watchdog should be the Our legislation is supported by more than thirty groups, including the National Military Family Association, the Military Officers Association of America, Veterans Education Success, Student Veterans of America, Consumer Federation of America, Americans for Financial Reform, Public Citizen, the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, U.PIRG, Consumers Union, National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low income clients), National Community Reinvestment Coalition, Center for Popular Democracy, Alliance for Justice, American Association for Justice, and the Center for Responsible I urge our colleagues to help honor our commitment to our Nation's service members by joining us in this effort to improve the supervision and enforcement of the                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgS3688.txt,1982,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,21.0,July
526,topic-id,1133,"Madam President, let me thank my colleague, Senator Manchin, for arranging the time to talk about the ongoing opioid epidemic across the country. I know his home State of West Virginia--much like my home State of Rhode Island--has been hit particularly hard by this epidemic.  This is not happening in some far off place or some distant country. It is happening in Rhode Island, West Virginia, and, indeed, every State throughout the Last year, over 330 Rhode Islanders lost their lives due to opioids.[[Page S3174]]  Rhode Island is a small State, so let me talk about a national statistic that shows the extent of this crisis. Last year, drug overdoses killed 50,000 That means more people died last year because of drug overdoses than due to car crashes or gun violence. These numbers are staggering, and it is happening in all of our communities.  Since 2011, the number of overdose deaths has increased by more than 90 percent. Unfortunately, year after year, Rhode Island continues to top the Nation in terms of rates of overdose deaths. We must work to turn this around and get more people access to treatment for opioid addiction.  In 2008, almost a decade ago, Congress enacted the landmark Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity For the first time, the law required insurance companies to cover behavioral health services in the same way that it would cover physical health services. This was a critical step, but it ultimately did not solve the problem, as some insurance companies have continued to find ways to avoid complying with the law--or at least its spirit.  It took passage of the Affordable Care Act to improve access to behavioral health services. For the first time, critical consumer protections, like banning discrimination based on preexisting conditions, ensured that individuals with substance abuse disorders could not be denied coverage.  Further, the ACA established a set of essential health benefits that all insurance plans must cover, including mental health and substance abuse treatment. Gone are the days when consumers would pay steep prices for health insurance that in actuality did not even cover basic health services, such as mental health care or maternity care.  In addition, the ACA prohibits lifetime annual limits on care. Before the ACA, many people with chronic health conditions, such as substance use disorders, would hit their annual cap just a couple of months into the year and then would have to pay all other costs out of pocket for the rest of the year.  Lastly, the expansion of Medicaid has made a tremendous improvement in access to behavioral health services. In States like Rhode Island that have expanded Medicaid, we have seen a sharp drop in the percentage of people with substance use disorders who seek care in the emergency department because they are uninsured. Medicaid is the single largest payer of substance use disorder services and pays for one-third of all medication-assisted treatment in the country.  TrumpCare would reverse all these gains. According to the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, repeal of the ACA would mean 2.8 million people with substance use disorders would be at risk of losing their coverage. Repeal of the Medicaid expansion would cut $4.5 billion from mental health and substance use disorders for those with low incomes, to say nothing of TrumpCare's broader goal of ending Medicaid as we know it. TrumpCare would all but eliminate this critical safety net.  TrumpCare goes even further to turn back the clock on consumer protections like preexisting conditions. People with substance use disorders would be disadvantaged immediately, as their disorder could be considered a preexisting condition. This has the double effect of pricing people with mental and behavioral health issues out of the market entirely and encouraging people not to seek care out of fear of being labeled by their insurance company as having a preexisting condition.  On top of that, TrumpCare would gut the essential health benefits in the This means that there would be no rules about what health insurance must cover, such as preventive health services and mental and behavioral health services. Even with coverage, people will have to pay out of pocket for the services they need. For substance use disorders, which could add up to $20,000 a year in out-of-pocket costs alone.  Over the last couple of years, I have worked with my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to include historic funding increases for programs that help the opioid crisis. In fact, the fiscal year 2017 omnibus provided $511 million for prevention, enforcement, treatment, and recovery across various agencies, including over $300 million for the Department of Health and Human Services, $50 million for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and over $160 million for the Department of Last year, we passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which directed $1 billion to States to combat the opioid crisis. We must continue these efforts.  However, this week, the President released his budget proposal for next year, and it does the exact opposite. First of all, the President's budget doubles down on his plan to decimate The President has proposed cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid, block-granting the program with no protections for the most vulnerable. In fact, his budget offers no details on how it plans to structure Medicaid--just that he intends to cut the program beyond repair.  On top of that, the President's budget makes enormous cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency, SAMHSA, which implements many of our most effective substance use disorder prevention and treatment programs, such as the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant Program, which President Trump has proposed cutting by over 20 percent.  Further, President Trump has proposed cutting the National Institutes of Health by nearly $6 billion, which would interrupt critical research into new and better ways to treat substance use disorders, along with research into how we can better treat pain without the use of addicting opioid painkillers. Coupled with TrumpCare, this budget proposal would only worsen the opioid crisis.  I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues to prevent that from happening. I am heartened to see so many of my colleagues talk about these very issues this afternoon.  It is my hope that we will be able to work together over the coming months to ensure that the gains we have made in the fiscal year 2017 omnibus and the Cures Act are not lost. We have much more work to do, and people in my State and across the country are counting on us to do that for them.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

401,topic-id,753,"Mr.Speaker, today we have an opportunity to send to the President's desk legislation bringing unprecedented accountability to the VA and badly needed protections for whistleblowers who expose wrongdoing.  Mr.Speaker, as someone who has worked with whistleblowers to shed light on negligence, abuse, and even criminal activity within the Central Alabama VA, I can tell you that this reform legislation is long overdue. When it comes to the VA scandal that erupted a few years ago, most Americans probably remember Phoenix, Arizona, and the horrendous activity that happened there. Phoenix became the epitome of a nationwide VA accountability problem, and rightly so.  However, in many ways, the Central Alabama VA could also be considered a poster child for the need of reform of the Department of Veterans Affairs from top to bottom. It might not have garnered as many headlines as Phoenix, but the nature and extent of the abuse inside the Central Alabama VA was every bit as bad, if not worse.  My staff and I worked with courageous whistleblowers and dedicated journalists to pull back the curtain there. Here are just a handful of examples of what we found:  More than 900 X-ray cancer screenings, some showing malignancies, were lost and unread for years. When alerted to the problem, top administrators tried to cover it up.  A VA pulmonologist manipulated more than 1,200 patient records, but even after being caught twice, was still give an satisfactory review.  Perhaps the most disturbing is a Central Alabama VA employee took a recovering veteran to a crack house and bought him drugs and provided him prostitutes in order to extort his VA payments. And even when caught, this employee was not fired, not until 1\1/2\ years later, when we exposed it in the newspaper.  The crack incident stands out in my mind for many reasons. First, it still haunts me to my core just how callous[[Page H4864]]and uncaring a person could be to do such a thing to a veteran patient. Second, it illustrates just how complacent the bureaucracy had become to let that behavior slide. And third, it is chilling to think that we would never have even known about it if not for a brave VA employee who walked into my Montgomery office and handed us a copy of the police report.  Thankfully, under the 2014 reform law, the director of the Central Alabama VA was fired in the wake of these exposures. That law took an important step toward speeding up the termination process for top officials. But did you know that he remains the only senior official fired as a result of the VA scandal?  Mr.Speaker, we all know that law did not go far enough. For one thing, it did not extend the strict accountability standards to rank-and-file employees. Senior managers aren't the only ones responsible for the failures at the There has been a culture of complacency up and down the chain of command for a very long time, and the complicated process for disciplining or removing problem employees only makes it worse.  That law also didn't go far enough to protect whistleblowers. There is no question in my mind that without the courage of those who came forward to tell the truth, very little would have changed at the Central Alabama VA, if anything at all, yet those whistleblowers were the very targets of retaliation from supervisors and other officials.  Mr.Speaker, today we have the opportunity to take that next step on behalf of our veterans and those who are working to serve them. 1094, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, grants the VA Secretary the power to fire, demote, or suspend any VA employee no matter their rank. The bill also increases protections for whistleblowers who put themselves at risk to improve the lives and care for veterans.  Let me say that most VA employees care a great deal about veterans and work very hard to provide the best service. It is not fair for the hardworking employees of the VA that a few bad actors get to evade punishment. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, has said he wants greater authority to remove bad employees as he sees fit. It is time for Congress to give him that authority and to let him know what we expect and that we expect him to use it.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing by our veterans, to pass this legislation today and send it to the President's desk.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgH4863-2.txt,1986,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,13.0,June

In their healthcare bill, they slash Medicaid and, for the first time in its history, cap Federal funding. The result: hospital closures, reimbursement and staffing cuts, reduced access, and lower quality. Now, in this bill, they want to impose another cap, a cap on noneconomic damages for injured healthcare consumers.  So who will be hurt?  It will be people like the 76-year-old woman whose tailbone had to be removed because her bed sores went untreated for 12 days or an 81-year-old resident who died because her ventilator was dislodged, alarms sounded, and no one responded.  How about the family of a 92-year-old man who died after suffering from malnutrition and dehydration and was found with live insects in his eyes and mouth?

So the fact that it wasn't voted on means the people of America and the people of the world can breathe a sigh of relief because methane--one of the great causes of global warming--will not be released into the atmosphere as easily.                          Russia Investigation  Mr.President, now on the topic of the day, this morning the Democratic caucus met to discuss the circumstances of Mr.Comey's dismissal by the White There are many questions to be answered and many actions to be taken. We will be pursuing several things in the coming days and weeks that we decided in our caucus, and we will have more to say about those next steps in the days ahead, but there are three things our caucus agreed must happen right away.  First, Mr.Rosenstein should not be the one to appoint the special prosecutor. That responsibility should go to the highest serving career civil servant at the Department of  Second, Mr.Comey is needed more than ever to testify before the  Third, Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should brief all Senators on these events separately and in a classified setting, if necessary, and they should do it soon because the questions are just swirling about, and there are more every day, almost every hour.  Let me go over each.  First, it is the overwhelming view of my caucus that a special prosecutor should now be appointed to conduct the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Mr.Rosenstein cannot be the person to appoint him.  Serious doubts have been cast on Mr.Rosenstein's impartiality for two reasons: First, there are many reports that Director Comey met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week to make a request for more resources or help with the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to That would make the timing of this firing even more suspect. Second, Mr.Rosenstein signed his name to a highly political memo arguing for Director Comey's dismissal and made no complaint about the involvement of the Attorney General, who had recused himself from all matters relating to the Russia investigation, in recommending the firing of the man who was leading it.  It is hard to believe that a seasoned prosecutor without bias would have allowed Sessions to be a part of this. It is also hard to believe that a seasoned prosecutor would write such a memo, which seems highly political--not in the kind of language and not with the kind of annotation that prosecutors normally write.  These facts make it clear that the decision to appoint a special prosecutor should go to the highest ranking civil servant at the Department of Mr.Rosenstein and other political appointees appointed by the President, whom they are supposed to investigate, should not be the ones making a special call on a prosecutor, lest that decision be seen as influenced or, worse, made at the direction of the administration.  We need to assure the American people that they can have confidence in our criminal justice system to conduct the Russian investigation impartially. The best and only way to do that now would be for a career civil servant at the Department of Justice to be the person who decides on a special prosecutor. It should not be a political appointee who makes such a decision.  My friend, our great senior Senator from the State of California, brought this up in our meeting. Senator Feinstein's call that the appointment be made by someone who is a career civil servant, not a political appointee, has the widespread support of our caucus and is the only fair thing to do.  Second, we have also learned that Mr.Comey will no longer be appearing before the Intelligence Committee tomorrow. In his stead will be the Acting FBI Director, Andrew There are so many unanswered questions that only Mr.Comey can answer. We Democrats hope and expect that he will still come before the Senate in some capacity.  I for one salute Senator Burr and Senator Warner for inviting him to testify next week before the Intelligence It is the right thing to do. We ought to hear from Mr.At this moment of profound doubt about the reasons and timing of FBI Director Comey's firing by the President and about the status and progress of a very serious investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia by his agency, we require answers.  Third, the recent revelations about the Rosenstein and Comey meeting demand that the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General--Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein--brief the Senate and answer questions because of so many things swirling about from last night's firing. That briefing could be classified if necessary--it may be part classified, part not--and each briefing should be done separately.  Let me speak plainly. The prospect that a campaign for the Presidency of the United States colluded with a foreign power in order to win our Nation's highest office is as grave a topic for an investigation as there could be. It gets right to the heart of the pillar of our democracy: the fair and free elections of our representatives. And the fact that Mr.Rosenstein and Attorney General Sessions were involved in this firing when there are so many questions swirling about means they must come before us to answer questions. I hope Leader McConnell will understand the need for that and answer the plea I made this morning about this.  Furthermore, the fact that Mr.Rosenstein--which came out after I made my request--the fact that Mr.Rosenstein, by all reports, had a meeting with Director Comey where Comey asked for more resources makes it all the more important for Rosenstein to come because that might be the reason Comey was fired--because he was pursuing the investigation in an accelerated way that was very much needed.  So what we are seeking--the only thing we are seeking--are assurances that this investigation will be carried out in an impartial, independent way; that we get all the facts; that we get to the very bottom of this. All we are seeking is some assurance that the subject of this investigation is not able to[[Page S2868]]influence it or, God forbid, quash it. The topic of this investigation itself is very serious. The possibility that the investigation is being impeded or tampered with is even worse. That threatens the integrity of our criminal justice system and the hallowed American belief in rule of law. I believe this rises far above party labels. I believe it rises far above partisan politics.  I have been heartened that several Republicans have expressed concerns. I hope and expect our Republican friends will join us in these efforts to make sure this investigation is conducted in the manner it deserves. We want Congress's role to be nonpartisan, looking at the good of neither political party but, rather, the good of our dear country.  These are tough and serious times. We cannot shirk from our responsibilities, neither Democrats nor I hope everyone in this Chamber will rise to the occasion.  I thank my good friend from Minnesota for allowing me to speak.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                         Firing of James Comey  ",CREC-2017-05-10-pt1-PgS2853.txt,1036,1230,2017.0,10.0,June
518,topic-id,2328,"Mr.President, first, let me thank my good friend from Illinois for, as usual, his articulate, compassionate, and outstanding work and for the great job he and others did yesterday when they invited the people here. I reiterate just what the Senator from Illinois stated; that is, once they take repeal off the table--they are having real trouble with repeal--we want to sit down and make our healthcare system better. It is not perfect. No one thought it was.  It is better than it was. Many more people are covered. Preexisting conditions, college kids--kids get out of college, and they get healthcare. All of that is better. We don't want to get rid of everything, but we want to improve it. We are working. Forty-eight Senators, as my colleague from Illinois knows--every Democrat signed a letter to Leader McConnell saying we want to work with you to improve this system, not to sabotage the existing system, not to repeal the good things we have but to improve it.  And we have gotten no answer in that regard.

I am so blessed to have such a great, dedicated, loyal, hard-working, smart staff. One of their best traits is that they are not afraid to tell me when they think I am off base, and it helps keep things going right.  Well, Bill Dauster was one of the great staffers I have met in all the years I have been here in the He worked, of course, for Harry Reid, my dear friend. He is now working for Senator Van Hollen, but he will be retiring tomorrow.  Now, Bill was Leader Reid's deputy chief of staff for policy for many years. Before that he worked for the Budget Committee, the Finance Committee, and for Senator Feingold of The list of legislation that Bill has worked on is long and illustrious. He was known as a great friend and mentor to his colleagues wherever he went.  In Reid's office, he was jokingly called ``the butler'' because he was constantly trying to help other members of the staff. Senator Reid's staffers fondly remember Bill Dauster during the final days of the debt ceiling negotiations, running in and out of Senator Reid's office as he rushed to go meet with younger staffers on the Hill who were sent to him for advice. Even on his busiest days, Bill made time for others.  In an industry in which many rub shoulders and network after work, Bill was a different kind of guy. He was known to give the same response to any coworker who asked him to come to a social event. He would repeat: I love you, but I love my family more, and I need to be home with them. He was so dedicated to his family, we heard. He would regale us with many stories about them.  He came up with great ideas. He was a great sounding board for me.  So on behalf of all of us in the Senate, we want to thank Bill for his long service to the Senate, for his role in crafting legislation over three decades, and for his mentorship to other Senate aides, old and young. He is retiring, but his influence in this body will last long after he has left.  We all wish him well in this next phase of life, where, hopefully, he will be able to spend more time where he enjoys it the most--at home with his family.                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, another matter--healthcare. Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office, led by a Director who was handpicked by current HHS Secretary Tom Price, Donald Trump's appointee, released its analysis of the House Republican healthcare bill-- The report makes clear that TrumpCare would be a cancer on the American healthcare system--causing costs to skyrocket, making coverage unaffordable for many seniors and those with preexisting conditions, all the while leaving 23 million fewer Americans with health insurance.  Now, when people hear this, they say: Why would the Republicans want to do it? That just seems mean-spirited. Well, I will tell you why: because their 1 goal is to give a tax break for the wealthiest of People making above $250,000 pay an additional charge to help everyone else with healthcare on their unearned income--not on what they do when they are working, but on stocks, bonds, and investments. The 1 goal of our colleagues across the aisle, sadly, is to help those very rich people get even richer.  Now, to do that, they have to take away people's healthcare. To get the money for those tax breaks, they take away people's healthcare. So the bottom line is very simple: Unless you are a healthy millionaire, TrumpCare is a nightmare. I think that is why our Republican colleagues are having such trouble putting together their own bill, because, as Senator Durbin has noted, they have excluded us from their negotiations.  Well, the CBO report ought to be a final nail in the coffin of the Republican effort to sabotage our healthcare system. Republicans in Washington and the President should read the report cover to cover, throw their bill in the trash can, and begin working with Democrats on a real plan to lower costs and improve care.  There is a lot to unpack in this report. It came out late yesterday. So I want to focus on a couple of provisions this morning.  First, on health insurance costs, the CBO report makes clear that premiums under this bill are headed up in the next several years. Consumers would see their premiums increase by 20 percent for next year's plans. Now, Republicans will crow about premiums going down in the outer years--years away. But the decrease in premiums occurs for only one reason: The quality of the insurance will plummet. If you have a barebones plan that hardly helps you, where you have to pay huge deductibles, huge copayments, and huge premiums and it covers next to nothing, of course, the cost will eventually go down. What good is that? Why even talk about that kind of healthcare? People don't need it and don't want it. Cheaper insurance isn't going to help anyone if it doesn't actually lead to the healthcare people need.  Listen to this one. Older Americans--everyone in America 50 to 64 who doesn't have a lot of income, making say $25,000 a year--TrumpCare is going to force you to pinch pennies just to be able to afford health insurance. The CBO report says that some seniors could see their premiums go up a whopping 800 percent under this bill.  In one of the newspaper articles I saw, I think the senior citizen was in his early sixties. They were making about $25,000 or $30,000 a year--not unusual for a senior of that age--and their premiums went up from $1,700 to $13,000. How are you going to vote for that, my friends, telling these people who have worked hard their whole lives that they have to pay a lot more and a lot of that money is going to wealthy people for a tax cut?  What about out-of-pocket expenses? By the way, out-of-pocket expenses really bother people. How many of us have heard over and over again: I have healthcare, and, when I went to the doctor, they said: You, first, have to lay out $5,000. How many of us have heard that? The Republican bill makes it worse.  According to the CBO report, out-of-pocket costs could balloon for vital services in States where they decline to cover essential health benefits. Americans could be paying thousands of dollars more every year if they need maternity care or programs that treat substance abuse or mental health services.  Listen to this one. According to reports, in States that elect not to include maternity care, which every State could elect to do under the Republican bill--and many will--insurers would most likely sell maternity benefits as an add-on at $1,000 a month--$17,000 more in total. Under TrumpCare, women may well have to pay more--much more insurance--just because they are a woman, because of pregnancy. So costs go up, up, up. If, God forbid, this bill becomes law and costs go up, any citizen of this country should go to their Senators who voted for this and say: What the heck did you do? You made it worse.  Now, uncertainty in the market is the second issue. The CBO report confirms that the Republican attempts to[[Page S3165]]repeal the Affordable Care Act and the Trump administration's refusal to guarantee to continue making cost-sharing payments is causing the instability in the market.  Here is what the report says. Now, this is the report put out by the Republican-appointed head of the So this is not some Democratic propaganda-type document. These are ``just the facts, ma'am,'' as Mr.Friday said. Here is what the report says: ``Substantial uncertainty about the enforcement of the individual mandate and about future payments of the cost-sharing subsidies'' have led insurers to withdraw from the current marketplace.  AHIP--that is the biggest organization of our Nation's insurers, the insurance companies; they are nonpartisan--said the same thing.  Why, if our colleagues want more people to stay in the market and are complaining that people are leaving the market, don't we come together--hopefully, with the President, who thinks that he could do this on his own--and say: We are going to make this cost-sharing permanent. We all know insurers want certainty in the future or they pull out. That is what the insurance business is all about. Yet, grudgingly, one little step at a time, they don't take away the cost-sharing because they know the damage it would do--this is President Trump--but they are afraid to make it permanent and that causes problems.  So there is only one word for what the President is doing and our Republican colleagues are doing when it comes to the present healthcare system--sabotage. If our Republican friends continue to allow the President to play coy about these cost-sharing payments--which bring premiums down, which bring costs for average citizens down--as a potential threat, if we don't make cost sharing permanent, the system will deteriorate. Again, it will be on the President's back, on our colleagues' backs. I hate to say that, but those are the facts.  We want to make it permanent. We tried to put it in the appropriations bill, to make it permanent, which would have kept costs low or kept people in the exchanges. Our colleagues said no.  Finally, as to preexisting conditions, the CBO report states:       People who are less healthy would ultimately be unable to      purchase comprehensive non-group health insurance at premiums      comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase      it at all.  Let me repeat the last part of the CBO report written by an appointee of our Republican head of HHS: ``if they could purchase it at all.'' Think about that for a minute.  Under TrumpCare, if you have a preexisting condition, if you are sick, your health insurance costs could go up so high that you can't afford insurance. Before the new healthcare law passed under President Obama, how many of us heard from families: My daughter has cancer, but the insurance company won't cover me, or I got kicked off and I have to watch her suffer because I can't afford the treatment, the payments. It is horrible, heart-wrenching. It is going back to those days under this bill, unfortunately.  This report ought to be the final nail in the coffin of the Republican effort to sabotage our healthcare system. It will make much more certain that sick people are priced out of insurance companies, that the most vulnerable are left high and dry when they need care the most, when there is an illness in the family.  Is that the sort of healthcare system our colleagues envision for this country? When you are sick, when one of your family members is sick, is that when they are not allowed to give you healthcare? What in the heck do you have it for?  I certainly hope that is not the idea on the other side of the aisle, but this bill that the House passed would do it.  In conclusion, the nonpartisan scorekeepers have spoken loudly and clearly--no ambiguity. TrumpCare means higher costs and less care for the American people, the average Let's not lose sight of what is at stake here. The health and well-being of the American people is on the line. There are life-and-death consequences for so many millions of people. They are relying on us to get this right.  So for the good of the country, President Trump and our Republican colleagues should abandon TrumpCare, stop sabotaging the healthcare system, and work with Democrats--we are waiting--to fix our healthcare system, not pull it from under them.                              Memorial Day  Mr.President, finally, I have one more note. It is Memorial I want to take a moment to express my deep and abiding gratitude for the men and women in our armed services who gave their last full measure of devotion in defense of our Nation and our liberty.

652,topic-id,596,"Now, Mr.President, there are many subjects in this very quickly changing world in which we live. The next subject is infrastructure.  Today, President Trump will continue his infrastructure week in talking about inland waterways. I would like to repeat that Democrats welcome a discussion about these issues. Democrats have argued in favor of a large infrastructure package to address our crumbling roads and bridges, our levees, our dams, our ports, and our locks for a long time.

Needless to say, so far, the President's actions on infrastructure have been a disappointment. In 6 months, the President has not given any real details about his infrastructure plan. The most he has done is endorse an off-the-shelf plan to privatize air traffic control. In fact, he actually cut infrastructure spending in his budget by over $200 billion. Now, during what they have termed ``infrastructure week,'' the White House has only proposed to privatize much of our infrastructure.  Today, I expect more of the same--bold promises, few details. What details we do hear will likely be about how large financiers should decide where and how to build American infrastructure. That has never happened before. The approach will not address the very broad infrastructure needs we have. Financiers will not pay to finance infrastructure projects from which they cannot make a buck. It is their right to seek a profit--that is what businesses do and are supposed to do--but there is no such thing as a free lunch. They are going to need to get recompense when they lay out money. That kind of approach will not fix our water sewer systems. It will not expand rural broadband. It will not fix our energy grid. It will do one thing--lead to Trump tolls from one end of America to the other.  After the election, we stood ready to work with the President on a real bill, provided it would not be just tax breaks for private financiers or roll back labor and environmental protections. We even wrote a detailed blueprint on how to spend $1 trillion. That was the President's number. It would create 13 to 15 million jobs. It would rebuild our infrastructure--large parts of it--from one end of America to the other. It would not leave out rural areas that will never benefit from any kind of private financing, as Senators Barrasso and Moran have made clear.  We sent it to the White House and never heard a peep. I have talked to the President several times on the phone and said that I want to work with him on infrastructure--no response. Now we have their plan without any consultation from Even with talk that they should do this on reconciliation, there has been no Democratic support or votes or input. Just as their doing things by reconciliation is tying the Republican Party in knots on healthcare, it does not bode too well for them on tax reform. It will mess up infrastructure as well.  So I hope the President drops his go-at-it-alone infrastructure push and instead decides to sit down and talk to Democrats about the issue. We agree wholeheartedly on the problem and its magnitude. Let's sit down and start talking about what solutions actually make sense. Let's not have a few financiers who whisper into the President's ear determine our infrastructure policy--because it will be a flop.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3302-3.txt,1036,1230,2017.0,7.0,June

We call these individuals our Alaskan of the week. It covers Alaskans from all over the  As I have said repeatedly in every one of my ``Alaskan of the Week'' speeches, I believe Alaska is the most beautiful State in the country--I would argue, in the world. I urge everybody in the room--the pages, the Presiding Officer, and the folks watching on TV--to come see for yourself. It will be a trip of a lifetime, I guarantee it. But it is the people who truly make Alaska unique, people who are helping each other, people who face tough odds and conquer them, strong-willed, warm-hearted, tenacious people who have carved generous lives and sometimes in very extreme conditions.  Today, our Alaskan of the week is going to be a twofer. We are going to do two today. So I would like to recognize two Alaskans, Madison Englund of Fairbanks and Jennifer Troutman of Anchorage, as our Alaskans of the week. These are two special athletes who have made all of us in Alaska very proud.  Last month, Madison and Jennifer returned to Alaska with a slew of medals from the 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in First, these young women did everything in their power, including training their hearts out, to qualify for these world Olympic games, and when they got there, they excelled. Madison won a Gold Medal in the advanced super-G snowboard race and added a Silver Medal in the advanced giant slalom. Jennifer claimed a Silver Medal in Monday's advanced super-G ski race, as well.  Jennifer has been an athlete with Special Olympics for 11 years. During her freshman year of high school, she participated in bowling, track and field, and floor hockey through the Partners During her junior year, she found a passion for skiing and has been excelling on the slopes ever since, as you can see from these incredible medals from the Special She also works at Petco during her free time.  Madison has been part of Special Olympics for 7 years. Aside from sports, she enjoys other hobbies, to include playing the cello, camping, fishing, and caring for animals. She is proud of her dogs, and she has three of them. She also loves to make jewelry. She said it is her favorite hobby. In addition to all this, she has also won the Good Citizens Award from the Daughters of the American  Since its founding nearly 50 years ago and subsequent growth to all corners of the globe, the Special Olympics has brought hope and joy and self-esteem to countless children and adults with intellectual disabilities and, of course, to their families and friends and their supporters like me. Special Olympics has shown what can happen when a group of people get together and sweat it out and work hard in the name of fair competition, camaraderie, and perseverance. These Special Olympians--all Special Olympians, really--make us in Alaska proud.  I want to thank Jim Balamaci, who has been the Special Olympics Alaska head for many years, and his whole team for giving so many Alaskans the opportunity to get out to the field or the slopes and experience the fulfillment of sports for all.  In Alaska, we love our Special Olympics athletes. They are an inspiration to all of us, whether it is when they are competing or even participating in the Polar Plunge in the icy waters of Alaska every winter to raise money for Special  Congratulations again to Jennifer and Madison on your hard work and incredible achievements and representing Alaska so well.

This group of American heroes is often overlooked because knowledge[[Page H4346]]that George Washington's Culper Spy Ring existed was not disclosed until 1930.  Nathan Hale of the often noted ``I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country'' is claimed by Huntington to have been captured there and gave rise to the spy ring.  One of Culper's top spies was Robert Townsend of Raynham Hall, Oyster Bay, also known as Culper,  Townsend posed as a Tory merchant in New York He relayed intelligence concerning troop movements, supplies, and British plots, using an expensive spy ring, coded messages, invisible ink, and elaborate signal system using everything from drying laundry to buttons on clothing.  Their efforts turned the tide of the war by assisting Washington to outfox the British, even saving him from capture.  As Washington said, and as is recounted to members of today's CIA:  ``There is nothing more necessary than good intelligence to frustrate a designing enemy, and nothing requires greater pains to obtain.''  I would like to thank the North Shore Promotional Alliance, Raynham Hall, the Ward Melville Heritage Organization, and the producers of the AMC television show ``Turn'' for promoting the legacy of these unsung American patriots.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgH4345-7.txt,99999999999999,FEDERAL POWER ACT AMENDMENT,2017.0,18.0,June

365,topic-id,4664,"Mr.President, if I sound a little hoarse, it is because my allergies are acting up, but I feel just fine.  Let me start out by thanking Senator Her leadership on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee is pretty incredible.  For this Congress, I think this is the very first CRA that has been turned down. We have been voting on many of them since the Congress came back in session in This is the very first victory we have had on denying the  When we talk about what a CRA does, it is a very blunt instrument that has only been used once until this Congress, and what it does is just blow out an entire area of the law. So if you talk about this BLM methane rule and you have a part of the law that says the government shall try to prevent waste, well, if you blow that provision of the law out, the agency can do nothing until we get to the point that the Congress acts again, and sometimes we move very slowly.  So I really appreciate the leadership of Senator Cantwell, and I want to thank her so much and all of the members of her committee, in particular, Senator Senator Heinrich serves on that committee and has been very outspoken on this rule, and I believe his leadership has always been acknowledged by Senator Cantwell as well.  This issue that we are debating and that we had this good vote on is about three things. First of all, it is about the waste of a natural resource that the public and the Tribes own. Let's talk about the resource here for a second. We are talking about, to start with, natural gas. So when we think of natural gas, as many people know, what we are talking about is when you turn on your stove, and it is a natural gas stove, that is how we cook our food. Many houses run and heat on natural gas, and we know now that many of our powerplants are converting over to natural gas because it is a very good fuel in terms of lowering carbon emissions. So natural gas is a big part of our energy economy. It is actually going up as coal is going down.  Look at this photograph which shows more than $330 million of natural gas wasted. This just shows us the huge power of natural gas. What was happening is that natural gas was being flared. This depicts the top at one of these oil and gas operations. They are just burning that up. So rather than that energy being used at home or used in industry, it is just being wasted. On top of that, we know it has a massive climate impact.  This was a very commonsense rule. I think the thing people should understand is that several Western States, including Colorado and Wyoming, passed an almost identical rule to deal with this issue. All BLM tried to do was to use that common sense from the West, where it had already happened in several States, and put it in place for[[Page S2856]]the So this is a good, solid rule, and it is a commonsense rule, and I think it prevents waste, just like it was laid out to do.  The second point is that when we talk about this issue, it is about job creation. What we are talking about here is, when you have this kind of waste, how do you prevent the waste? Well, the thing we have seen in New Mexico that occurs is that many of these oil and gas industries reach out to people who maybe haven't been in business, and they say: How do we prevent this waste? Well, actually, we use infrared to focus on the oil and gas operations and all of their pipes, and we can detect the natural gas waste, and then we can go about actually fixing it at all the various fittings and places where that happens. Guess what. A lot of jobs are created in that process. This is growing in New Mexico, growing in Colorado, and with this rule in place, over time, it is going to continue to grow. So this is going to create some small businesses. It has already created small businesses, and it is going to be pretty dramatic on that front.  The third thing that we are here about has to do with public health. Obviously, if you are venting all of this--and as Senator Cantwell showed, you have a methane cloud the size of Delaware over the Four Corners area; so it is really impacting New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, and Arizona--what is the impact in terms of methane? Well, we know there are serious public health impacts. We know that asthma is impacted by this, as well as other respiratory diseases--the kinds of things that occur on a regular basis as we have that kind of methane pollution that goes into the air. As I mentioned just a little bit earlier, methane is a very, very powerful and potent greenhouse gas. So we know that by releasing it--the flaring that we talked about--we are wasting it and we are putting that methane into the atmosphere. We are also adding to the greenhouse gases, which are warming the planet and creating, in the Southwest, as we know, catastrophic forest fires, extreme weather events, impacts on water, and impacts on agriculture. So we know that it is here now and that the Western States are in the bull's-eye.  So let me just say that these are three commonsense things that we have done today by asserting this rule. We are preventing waste, we are moving job creation, and we are acting on the part of public health.  When we have a victory like this, there are just so many people that should be congratulated--people that pulled together. First of all, just to start, Senator Cantwell just finished, and she is our ranking member on the committee. Senator Bennet, I think, was actually the 51st, and I hope he tweeted that out. When he came over, we were at 50, and it went to 51. So he and all of the Democrats hung together on this--every single one of the It just shows that when we get Democratic unity--and with our Independents--we come right up on about 48 votes. If we get a couple of Republicans--if we work in a bipartisan way--to come with us, we can have a big impact. Who are the Republicans who voted with us? They should be called out and congratulated for having courage, for having common sense, and for stepping forward. I would just like to say about my three friends on the Republican side--Senator McCain, Senator Collins, and Senator Graham--thank you so much for stepping forward and seeing the commonsense nature of this issue and standing to make sure that we didn't head in the wrong direction on this.  Thinking a little bit about some of the groups that voted with us and worked with us and helped us and advised us out in the field, the groups that stood with us shoulder to shoulder include the Environmental Defense Fund, the Wilderness Society, and the Ceres business group. We had a lot of businesses--understanding that this is a business issue and a job creator--like Taxpayers for Common We don't always see them weigh in on regulations like this. The Center for Methane Emissions Solutions, and so many environmental and public health groups, including Earth Justice, the National Parks Association, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and many, many others, including the Western Environmental Law Center, are also a part of that.  I thought we should talk for a second about--in addition to all of those groups--some other groups that joined us, and they are these medical and public health groups that abhor natural gas waste. Look at all of these groups in addition to the ones I mentioned. These are people who have real expertise in public health: Allergy & Asthma Network, American Lung Association, American Public Health Association, Center for Climate Change and Health, and Physicians for Social I have always been impressed by that group. Here you have docs who are stepping up, wanting to be socially responsible on things. There are many wonderful physicians like that in New Mexico and across the Nation, and they have organized themselves as We also have the Public Health Institute and the National Medical  So we have a lot of these medical and public health groups that have stepped forward and said: We are not going to waste natural gas. Let me thank them.  Also, the Western Environmental Law Center, which is in New Mexico and works on this issue, has been a pretty incredible group, hard-working, headed up by a gentleman by the name of Doug Meiklejohn, and Doug really makes a difference on all of these issues in New Mexico and, in particular, really helped us out here.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention some of the groups that have pulled together--groups of ranchers, Tribes, and public health groups. We just talked about the public health groups. But there is one rancher in New Mexico whose sole focus has been this issue. His name is Don He appeared at a press conference yesterday here in Washington with Senator Bennet and Senator I was at my own press conference, and more or less as a Senator there, speaking out on methane. I know if Don is ever at a press conference, he is going to say what I would have said on this methane issue, which is that we have to prevent waste. Don Schreiber is his name. He is a rancher from Northwestern New He is actually up under that methane cloud, and he talks about his family and his ranching operation and what the impact is.  We also have Tribes in that area. I want to congratulate and thank President Begaye of the Navajo He sent in a very persuasive statement and made a very strong statement against wasting natural gas.  We also had the Western Organization of Resource This is another group that has been very active in the They stepped forward on this natural gas waste issue, and we are incredibly thankful to them.  Also, we never get anything done around here on the Senate floor without our wonderful staff. I want to thank Jonathan Black, who has worked on this issue for many years. Jonathan actually worked for Senator Bingaman on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, so he brought a lot of that expertise. We have a young man from the office sitting here with me on the floor, Sean MacDougall, helping me with these charts. Sean is a congressional fellow in our office on loan from the Bureau of Land Management, and he has brought a lot of knowledge to the table.  Mr.President, to reiterate, I oppose H.36--the Congressional Review Act resolution to disapprove the Bureau of Land Management's methane and waste prevention rule. BLM's rule prevents the unnecessary waste of a public resource and makes sure New Mexicans--and all American taxpayers--get fair value in return for commercial use of that public resource.  The rule requires oil and gas facilities operating on public and Indian lands to prevent unnecessary flaring, venting, and leaking of methane. Rigorous analysis shows that the overall benefits to the American public far outweigh the costs, and technology to implement the rule is readily available and cost-effective to industry.  The current BLM rules on natural gas waste are over 35 years old, issued in 1979. Federal watchdog agencies have been issuing reports for almost a decade--recommending that the BLM update its rules and prevent waste wherever possible.  With new technologies like horizontal drilling, the amount of gas wasted in recent years has increased significantly. From 2009 to 2013, the total[[Page S2857]]amount of natural gas flared on BLM land doubled.  We throw the phrase ``common sense'' around a lot these days when we talk about laws or regulations we like, but the BLM's waste prevention rule really is a commonsense rule.  Over the past 4 months, Congress has repealed 13 Federal rules using CRA authority. These regulations involved years of work by the agencies and were developed transparently through the public notice and comment process. Congress overturned these rules without public input, hearings, or debate.  I understand repeal of ``burdensome'' Federal regulations is a strong rallying cry, and I wholeheartedly agree that Federal regulations should not be overly burdensome.  The BLM's waste prevention rule is good for the American public, and the cost to industry is de minimus. In fact, there is benefit to industry from increased production and the resulting increase in revenues. The BLM's rule is one rule that should not get swept up in the political tide of CRA repeal.  Congress has spoken loud and clear that the BLM has an obligation to prevent waste of oil and gas on public and tribal lands starting with the 1920 Mineral Leasing  That act--governing leases on BLM lands--requires every lease to contain provisions for ``the prevention of undue waste. . . .''  Federal law obligates the BLM to make sure the public gets a fair return from profits generated by oil and gas leases on public lands. The 1976 Federal Lands Policy and Management Act requires that ``the United States receive fair market value of the use of the public lands and their resources. . . .''  The 1982 Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act obligates these same oil and gas companies to pay the Federal Government ``royalty payments on oil or gas lost or wasted.''  Congress has determined that oil and gas companies extracting resources on public lands can't waste the resource, and, if they do, they must pay fair market value to the American public.  Despite Congress's prohibition against waste, tremendous volumes of oil and gas under BLM lease are wasted each year through flaring, venting, and leaks.  Operators do not always use best practices when they flare and vent. Some even abuse the practice. As a result, operators vent and flare significant amounts of oil and gas that are economically recoverable.  Natural gas is colorless and odorless, so you can't see leaks with the naked eye. Operators do not always use best practices to detect and prevent leaks either, but we now have readily available technology, like infrared cameras, that quickly and easily identify leaks. We don't let leaky pipes in our homes go unattended. For-profit companies shouldn't be given a free pass to let gas leak on public lands.  Oil and gas operators under BLM leases reported flaring and venting 462 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2009 through 2015. That is enough gas to supply over 6.2 million households for one year. That is every household in the States of New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and  An independent study by ICF International estimates that, in 2013 alone, 65 billion cubic feet of gas was wasted. That includes over 18 billion cubic feet from tribal lands, with an estimated loss to the American public of $27 million in royalties.  The amount of oil and gas waste is rising dramatically. Oil and gas operators report flaring has increased over 1,000 percent between 2009 and 2015. The number of applications to vent or flare royalty free has gone from 50 in 2005 to 622 in 2011 to 1,246 in 2014.  The BLM's outdated rules and the loss of royalties caught the attention of the Government Accountability Office years ago.  A 2010 GAO report estimated that approximately 128 billion cubic feet of natural gas was vented or flared from Federal leases in 2008 and that approximately 50 billion cubic feet was economically recoverable. That recoverable gas represented $23 million in lost royalties in 1 year.  The 2010 GAO report highlighted real world experiences, where operators made money by putting in technologies to recover gas instead of venting or flaring. One large producer in the San Juan Basin installed equipment that reduced venting by 99 percent. That same company reported increased revenues of $5.8 million, from a $1.2 million investment in technology to reduce emissions during well completion. That is money well spent.  The San Juan Basin is one of the oldest and most productive gas-producing areas in the United It lies in the Four Corners area, where my home State of New Mexico touches Arizona, Colorado, and  That area is home to a methane ``hot spot,'' with the highest concentration of methane in the  In 2010, the GAO pointed out what was obvious, that the BLM's decades-old guidance did not take account of current technology to reduce venting and flaring. The GAO recommended that the BLM update its regulations to address the avoidable loss of gas on public lands.  There are other GAO reports, but I will talk about one more.  In 2016, the GAO issued a report entitled, ``Interior Could Do More to Account for and Manage Natural Gas Emissions.'' It detailed the BLM's highly inconsistent practices approving royalty-free venting and flaring incidents.  Looking at a random sample of operator requests to vent or flare from fiscal year 2014, the GAO found that fully 90 percent had inadequate documentation, but, despite the bad documentation, the BLM approved 70 percent of the requests, almost half of which were for royalty-free venting or flaring. That is a lot of Federal, State, and tribal royalties lost based on incomplete records.  The GAO is charged with helping Congress make sure Federal agencies are doing the best job they can for the American public. We should not disregard repeated GAO recommendations--spanning almost a decade--for the BLM to modernize its oil and gas royalty program.  If we pass this disapproval, the BLM is foreclosed from updating these rules. In the face of the GAO report after another telling us that the BLM must do better, that would be just irresponsible to taxpayers.  Secretary Zinke has been charged to review the BLM rule as part of the President's ``Energy Independence'' Executive order. If, after review, the Secretary concludes that the BLM rule should be modified, the Department of the Interior can proceed to amend the rule through the public rulemaking process, but, when we have been told time and time again that there is unnecessary waste and the BLM rules need updating, Congress should allow the DOI review to go forward and not permanently prevent DOI from considering how to prevent unnecessary waste by oil and gas facilities.  Let's not forget that half the royalties from Federal leases go to State treasuries. States use these royalties for schools, roads, and infrastructure projects.  My home State of New Mexico has the second highest number of acres under BLM lease in the country, after Wyoming--over 4.6 million acres--and the second highest number of BLM oil and gas leases--over 8,000.  New Mexico has a lot at stake in the BLM's waste prevention rule.  ICF International estimates that the natural gas in New Mexico that could have been captured and marketed under the BLM's rule between 2009 and 2013 would have been worth more than $100 million a year and would have produced $43 million in royalty payments for our  In New Mexico, those royalty payments are used in part for educational materials in the public schools. That is textbooks, digital materials, science supplies, art supplies, and accessible materials for students with disabilities. That $43 million would have gone a long way for New Mexico schoolkids.  Many of you may be aware of the methane ``hot spot'' over the Four Corners area that I talked about earlier. The hot spot covers about 2,500 square miles--the size of the State of  This single cloud comprises nearly 10 percent of all methane emissions from natural gas in the United The San Juan Basin is ranked 1 in per capita methane pollution in the U. Scientists have been researching the sources of this methane plume. When the hot spot was discovered, oil and gas companies claimed the high concentrations were caused by ``natural''[[Page S2858]]sources, but researchers have found out this is wrong. They have identified 250 sources--the majority of which are oil and gas operations and include gas wells, storage tanks, pipelines, and processing plants.  Of the four States, only Colorado has robust rules to prevent methane emissions. Colorado's rules are proving successful, and the BLM incorporated provisions from those rules.  It is important for my State that the BLM's waste prevention rule stay on the books. We don't need that methane hot spot in our backyard and New Mexico sorely needs the royalty payments owed.  The BLM's rule is also important for tribes. As vice-chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I work to make sure the Federal Government upholds all its trust responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is making sure tribes get the royalties they are entitled to from private oil and gas companies operating on Indian lands.  Tribes receive 100 percent of the royalties from the oil and gas leases on their lands. The BLM estimates tribes will get up to $12 million more in royalties over 10 years under the rule. That is money we have a trust responsibility to make sure tribes get.  The BLM estimates the rule would reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, by 310,000 tons over 10 years on tribal lands. Reducing VOC emissions means cleaner air for tribes.  The Federal Government will not be upholding its trust responsibility if the BLM rule is repealed.  I have a statement from the Navajo Nation president, Russell Begaye, detailing the reasons the tribe supports the BLM's rule. President Begaye states, ``It would be contrary to BLM's trust responsibility to allow Navajo Nation resources to be unreasonably wasted, particularly when best practices can be cost-effectively employed and are not overly burdensome to industry.''  A really important cobenefit of the rule is protection of public health. Toxic chemicals like benzene--harmful to the public, carcinogenic--are emitted with methane. Reducing methane emissions will reduce these toxic emissions.  Similarly, other VOCs--that contribute to ozone or smog--are emitted with methane. Reducing methane emissions will reduce smog formation. Smog irritates the respiratory system, reduces lung function, and aggravates asthma--among other public health problems.  Without the Rule, not only do we lose royalties for hospitals, schools, and roads, but citizens pay more for their hospital visits and healthcare.  Industry arguments against the rule do not hold up.  Industry argues the rule costs too much and will kill jobs.  That is not true. Here are the facts.  First, the rule will result in increased production and increased revenues, and the technologies and practices to prevent waste are economically feasible.  In fact, many oil and gas operations will see a net benefit. Like the company in the San Juan Basin that got almost a fivefold return on its investment.  The BLM conducted an exhaustive cost-benefit analysis of the rule.  Looking at the average cost to a company to implement the rule, the BLM found that profits would be reduced by only 0.15 percent, a bit over one-tenth of 1 percent. That is minimal.  That cost does not even count the savings to industry from increased production and increased revenues.  In fact, the BLM found that net economic benefits to industry could be as much as $47 million per year--taking into account the savings from increased revenues.  If the benefits of reducing methane are included, the overall net benefit is huge--up to $204 million annually.  That number does not even count the public health benefits from reduced ozone and hazardous pollutants.  Opponents have exaggerated the costs to industry, and they have not taken into account the benefits to States, tribes, and the public.  Finally, there is no evidence anywhere that the rule will cost even one job.  In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has recorded 2,700 new jobs since November 2016, while the price of oil has stayed flat. This month, the Baker Hughes rig count showed 300 more rigs drilling for oil and gas since the BLM rule came into effect. This is an increase in production of over 50 percent.  Colorado issued the most comprehensive rules to date to decrease methane emissions, and not only have no jobs been lost, but jobs have been gained as new companies and technologies focused on inspection, monitoring, and compliance have opened. These are good American jobs.  In New Mexico, we have at least 11 new companies in the methane mitigation business, and I want to see that number grow.  Even if the rule were to force an operator to shut down, that company would be eligible for exemption from the requirements.  So job loss is not an issue.  Second, we hear that the BLM's rule is duplicative and unnecessary, that the EPA's methane rule is adequate, and that States are already regulating methane.  Here are the facts.  The EPA's rule only applies to new and modified oil and gas operations. The BLM's rule applies also to existing facilities. This is a big difference between the rules. Making sure all current operations prevent waste is critical to making sure taxpayers get the benefit owed.  The BLM's rule covers areas not covered by other Federal or State rules, like wasteful routine flaring.  Not all States have passed methane waste prevention rules. My home State of New Mexico has not. New Mexico needs to reduce methane emissions.  Also, States and tribes may get a variance if they have similar rules that achieve the same results.  The BLM worked with the EPA and States to ensure the rule works for them and does not impose conflicting or redundant requirements.  Just last week, the EPA announced a 90-day delay on its own methane control rule based on industry's objections to regulation. More concerning, the EPA withdrew its information request from industry that was intended to help EPA determine how to address methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. These EPA actions mean the BLM rule is needed more than ever to reduce natural gas waste and the proper collection of royalties.  Third, we hear that the BLM lacks the authority to regulate methane waste.  In January of this year, the U.District Court of Wyoming denied a preliminary injunction to block the rule. The court found that the rule ``unambiguously'' was within the BLM's authority.  The Congressional Review Act is a blunt tool, and it is the wrong tool for Congress to use to change provisions in BLM's methane waste prevention rule. Disapproval under the CRA would permanently block the BLM's authority to reform outdated rules, reforms that the GAO began recommending almost a decade ago.  The BLM should not be prevented from making sure the Federal Government meets its obligations to States, tribes, and taxpayers--the obligation not to waste public resources and to make sure the public gets a fair return on the for-profit use of public resources.  For these reasons, I oppose the CRA to disapprove the BLM's waste prevention rule.  Just as a final word to summarize why we are here and why this victory was so important and why we need to hang tough on this: This could be changed if they decide to do another vote or if they try to do another piece of legislation or something. The core of this needs to be protected. We are here because we don't want to waste our natural resources, which belong to the people of America and belong to the We want to create jobs, which is what this BLM methane waste prevention rule does. It creates jobs, and it protects the public health.  I believe we are going to have a couple other speakers. I know Senator Heinrich is going to be here.
