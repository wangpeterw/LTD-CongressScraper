                  MURDER IS NOT CAUSED BY GUNS, TRUCKS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, The Times and Democrat of 
Orangeburg, South Carolina, published a thoughtful editorial on 
November 21, entitled: ``Murder is not caused by guns, trucks.''
  The editorial begins:
  ``Every time violence hits close to home, the debate is renewed.''
  ``. . . the Nation has been stunned by mass killings in Las Vegas, 
Texas, and New York City. In two of the incidents, guns were the weapon 
of terror. In New York--as has been the case in Europe in recent 
times--a truck was used to run over innocent people.''
  The editorial continues: ``It is time to take a look beyond the 
surface issue such as weapons--and stop the blame game, says Marianne 
Clyde, a licensed therapist and expert in mental health in the 
workplace with more than 27 years of experience.''
  Clyde continues: ``The world will change, not by overregulation, 
blaming, demonizing, but rather by one person at a time, taking 
personal responsibility for our thought processes and responses, 
creating an environment that creates unity and solutions that work.''
  The editorial concludes by noting that, ``Clyde's point is to have 
individuals look deeper and realize that her points back up the title 
of her writing: `Murder is not caused by guns or trucks, but by our 
thinking.' ''
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
