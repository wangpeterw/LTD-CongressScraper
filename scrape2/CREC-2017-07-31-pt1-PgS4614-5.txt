                      TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH GREGORY

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Elizabeth for her hard work 
as an intern in the Senate Republican Policy Committee. I recognize her 
efforts and contributions to my office, as well as to the State of 
Wyoming.
  Elizabeth is a native of New Jersey. She currently attends Villanova 
University, where she is studying political science. She has 
demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made her an invaluable 
asset to our office. The quality of her work is reflected in her great 
efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Elizabeth for the dedication she has shown while 
working for me and my staff. It was a pleasure to have her as part of 
our team. I know she will have continued success with all of her future 
endeavors. I wish her all my best on her next journey.
