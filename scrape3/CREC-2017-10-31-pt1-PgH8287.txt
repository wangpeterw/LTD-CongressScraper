        CONGRATULATIONS TO JEFFERSON COUNTY DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Jefferson County Development Council for being named 
Partner of the Year by the Pennsylvania Economic Development 
Association.
  The Jefferson County Development Council has demonstrated outstanding 
accomplishments and, over the past year, has gone above and beyond in 
carrying out its mission to serve existing and new businesses in 
Jefferson County, Pennsylvania. Led by Brad Lashinsky, director of 
economic development and planning, the Jefferson County Development 
Council works to help new businesses start up, relocate, or expand.
  The Jefferson County Development Council was named Partner of the 
Year for effectively utilizing various funding sources to complete a 
number of community and economic development projects. It also 
facilitated the formation of the Jefferson County Resource Partnership, 
which is a collection of professionals who make up the economic 
development delivery system in the county and who focus on providing 
assistance to businesses in all stages of business development and 
growth.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the Jefferson County Development Council 
for the work it does, and I wholeheartedly congratulate them on this 
outstanding achievement.
