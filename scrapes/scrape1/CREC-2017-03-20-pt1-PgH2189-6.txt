                     RECOGNIZING MAJOR ERIKA PERRY

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on February 12, an 
historic change of command ceremony was held for the South Carolina 
National Guard 51st Military Police Battalion. Lexington High School 
math teacher Major Erika Perry became the first female commander of 
this battalion.
  Major Perry comes from a military family, with both her father and 
grandfather serving in the United States military. She was commissioned 
as a military police officer in 2001 and became a platoon leader in the 
133rd Military Police Company in 2003, being deployed to Iraq.
  A recent article in Cola Daily, edited by Terry Ward, detailed: 
``During her years in the National Guard, Perry served in Iraq and 
Afghanistan and on the home front during times of crisis, like 
Hurricane Matthew. She appreciates the LHS administration's support of 
her military career throughout her 19 years at the school.''
  Congratulations to the University of South Carolina men's and women's 
basketball teams on their victories last night, securing their place in 
the NCAA's Sweet 16 as one of the few universities to have teams in 
both tournaments simultaneously. Go, Gamecocks.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
