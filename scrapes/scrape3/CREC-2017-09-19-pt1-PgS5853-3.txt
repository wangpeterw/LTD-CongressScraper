                        REMEMBERING FRAN JARRELL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of 
Fran Jarrell, of Paintsville, KY, who passed away on August 27, 2017, 
at the age of 72.
  For many years, Fran was a driving force in her community. She served 
on numerous public committees and boards, supporting the efforts of 
organizations from the mentoring committee for Community of Hope to the 
Paintsville Garden Club. She also was a member of the Paintsville City 
Council for many years, dedicating herself to making the community a 
better place to live and work. Most recently, Fran was the executive 
director of the Paintsville/Johnson County Chamber of Commerce, where 
she was committed to bringing economic development and opportunity to 
the area. In her numerous roles, Fran worked to bring out the beauty 
and possibilities of her city.
  The Paintsville community mourned Fran's passing. Flowers decorated 
the entire downtown area as a tribute to her life, her passion, and her 
dedication to others. Elaine and I send our condolences to Fran's 
children, sisters, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
