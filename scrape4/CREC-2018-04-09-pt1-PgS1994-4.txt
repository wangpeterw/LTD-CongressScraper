         MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2629 AND H.R. 5247

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the 
desk due for a second reading en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is correct.
  The clerk will read the bills by title for the second time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 2629) to improve postal operations, service, and 
     transparency.
       A bill (H.R. 5247) to authorize the use of eligible 
     investigational drugs by eligible patients who have been 
     diagnosed with a stage of a disease or condition in which 
     there is reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a 
     matter of months, or with another eligible illness, and for 
     other purposes.

  Mr. McCONNELL. In order to place the bills on the calendar under the 
provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bills will be 
placed on the calendar.
