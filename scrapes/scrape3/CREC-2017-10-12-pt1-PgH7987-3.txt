                DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I was grateful to join 
Secretary Rick Perry and my colleagues, Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, 
Congressman Joe Barton, and Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, yesterday to 
celebrate the Department of Energy's 40th birthday.
  The goals presented of progressing our science, protecting our 
Nation, and promoting our energy were meaningful to me, having served 
as Deputy General Counsel under Secretary Jim Edwards of the Reagan 
administration. I was also grateful to have worked at the Savannah 
River Site, where I saw firsthand so many dedicated personnel.
  In Washington, I served with General Counsel R. Tenney Johnson; was 
welcomed by Administrative Assistant Marsha McQueen; and was trained by 
Deputy General Counsel Eric Fygi, who was recognized as an original DOE 
staff member.
  I look forward to working with Secretary Perry to ensure continued 
progress on our nuclear cleanup missions, effective stewardship of the 
nuclear weapons stockpile, and continued research and development at 
our Nation's national labs. DOE now clearly promotes energy development 
to create jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
