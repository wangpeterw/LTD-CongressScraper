4096,topic-id,1689,"Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the confirmation of Congressman Tom Price to be Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  Congressman Price has a long political record in Washington of siding with Big Business and not American families. He has led efforts that would force families to lose their health care coverage, that would end Medicare as we know it, and increase costs for our seniors, and that would let politicians choose what health care is best for women and their doctors. Perhaps most troubling, though, are recent revelations about Congressman Price's deep and ethically questionable financial ties to health companies that are looking to turn a profit.  The people of Wisconsin elected me to the United States Senate to stand up to powerful interests, to stand up for the working people of my They surely did not send me to the Senate to take away people's health care. That is why I simply cannot vote for a nominee whose financial activities with health companies raise such serious ethical questions and who has repeatedly opposed measures that would improve the health of our hard-working middle-class families in  During his time in Congress, reports show that Congressman Price traded more than $300,000 in shares of health companies while he was advancing health-related legislation which could directly impact these companies' profitability. Congressman Price's financial disclosures show that he has purchased stock in medical device companies, leading pharmaceutical companies, and medical equipment companies. He also led a number of legislative efforts to restrict or delay implementation of several Medicare programs that would have impacted reimbursement for these very industries.  I don't know who Congressman Price is working for. Is he working for the American people or is he working for the powerful corporations to help advance his financial interests and his investments in them? This ethically questionable activity raises too many unanswered questions about his professional judgment and his ability to fairly lead a department that is charged with protecting the health of all  Even more troubling are reports that he had access to a special private deal to buy discounted stock in an Australian biomedical firm, Innate Reports show he received this special deal from his colleague in the House, Congressman Chris Collins, who sits on the company's board and is their largest investor. I sent a letter asking Congressman Price to explain his relationship, his involvement with Innate Immuno, and how his relationship with Congressman Collins influenced those purchasing decisions, but he hasn't responded. His financial dealings raise serious concerns about potential STOCK Act and insider trading law violations. That is why I have called on the U.Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate his stock market trading activities. These questions must be answered and his stock trading should be fully investigated before the Senate is able to adequately consider his nomination. Yet we are probably hours from the vote without all the information.  While there are so many unanswered questions about Congressman Price's ethical judgment, there is a lot we do know about his record as a politician that is deeply concerning.  We know Congressman Price wants to end Medicare as we know it and raise costs for our senior citizens. Medicare is a promise, a promise to current and future generations that guaranteed health care will be there for them when they need it. Congressman Price wants to break that promise, that promise to millions of seniors across this country. He has spearheaded proposals that would convert Medicare into a voucher system, essentially privatizing He also supports raising the eligibility age for participation in Medicare, forcing hard-working Americans to wait to receive the benefits they have already earned. His dangerous proposals would force seniors to pay more and would jeopardize guaranteed access to the Medicare benefits they have today, but we don't need to take my word for it. Listen to the thousands of Wisconsinites who have written to me just since the start of this year, urging me to oppose Congressman Price's confirmation and to fight against any efforts that would take away their Medicare benefits.  Richard from Fond du Lac, WI, is just one of those Richard and his wife are now retired and on He wrote to say:       We both spent decades in teaching and while we knew we      would never get rich, we believed we were doing important      work with our students.       Both of us felt secure in knowing that Medicare would be      there for us when we left the profession and moved on to our      retirement years.  Richard cannot understand why politicians like Congressman Price are proposing to fundamentally change a system that has worked well for decades. He told me: ``Now we feel as if our world is being turned upside down.''  Congressman Price's views are not only out of touch with America's seniors, but they are also, interestingly, in conflict with President Trump's promise not to cut Price's legislative record also conflicts with President Trump's public commitments to improve this program by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for our seniors. Just this week, the White House confirmed the President's support for this proposal again. Yet, during his hearing before the Senate Health Committee, Congressman Price refused to answer my questions when I repeatedly asked him if he would commit to standing with the President and with American seniors by supporting Medicare negotiation of better prescription drug prices. We don't know where he stands on this issue, but we do know Congressman Price does not stand with seniors, and he does not stand for protecting the guarantee of Medicare coverage that our families rely on.  We also know that Congressman Price does not stand for the millions of Americans who rely on the health care coverage and protections available under the Affordable Care Congressman Price almost personifies the Republican agenda and battle to repeal the Affordable Care Act and all of its benefits and protections, which would force 30 million Americans to lose their current insurance through participation in the program. He has led the effort in the House to take away guaranteed health care coverage and has championed dangerous measures that would put insurance companies back in charge of health care and lead to higher costs and more uncertainty for American families. Congressman Price's agenda is putting the health care coverage of over 200,000 Wisconsinites at risk.  I wish to share the story of Sheila from Neenah, She is a small business owner and relies on the premium tax credits that helped her purchase her health plan through the marketplace. She wrote:       I just wanted to let you know how devastating it would be      for my family if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. To take      away the subsidies would pretty much turn the plan into the      Unaffordable Care  Sheila said that premium tax credits under the law have made it possible for her to buy decent insurance for the first time in her whole career.  I am listening to Chelsea from Shelby, Her daughter Zoe was born with a congenital heart defect. At just 5 days old, Zoe needed to have open heart surgery. Chelsea said:       The Affordable Health Care Act protects my daughter. . . .      I'm pleading to you as a mother to fight for that and follow      through on that promise. There are so many kids in Wisconsin      with heart defects (as well as other kids with pre-existing      conditions) that are counting on you to protect that right.  I am listening to Maggie, who attends college in DePere, Maggie was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, she was able to stay on her parents' health insurance, which covered most of her[[Page S994]]care. The Affordable Care Act also ensured that Maggie did not face lifetime limits on coverage for her multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation. Thankfully, Maggie is now cancer-free, but Maggie is terrified--terrified that if the law's benefits are repealed, she could face a situation where her chemo isn't covered if she ever needs it again. She also fears being denied coverage because of her preexisting condition or not being able to stay on her parents' plan.  During my time serving in the House of Representatives, I championed the provision in the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults like Maggie to remain on their parents' health care plan until age 26. Congressman Price would take that away, as well as other protections that Maggie relies on, and instead go back to letting the insurance companies decide what to do.  During his HELP Committee hearing, I asked him directly if he supports the current requirement that insurance companies cover young adults until age 26. Essentially, he refused to answer my question but instead said that he trusts insurance companies to do this on their own. He said: ``I think it's baked into insurance programs.''  Our future leaders like Maggie can't afford to take his word for it that insurance companies will choose to protect their care. The stakes are too high when it comes to accessing the lifesaving health care for cancer or other serious conditions.  As I travel my State, I listen and I hear the voices of people who are struggling. Too many people feel that Washington is broken and it isn't working for them. People are scared because they can't make ends meet and provide a better future for their children. We need to change that. Our work here should be focused on making a difference in people's everyday lives.  I am concerned that if confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman Price would make it harder for people to get ahead. I am concerned that he will work with special interests who already have too much power here in Washington instead of working for the Wisconsin families I was sent here to serve.  For all these reasons, Congressman Price is not the right choice for Secretary of Health and Human Services, and I urge my colleagues to oppose his confirmation.  I yield the floor.

4253,topic-id,533,"Mr.Speaker, today we are starting efforts to reformulate the Animal Protection Caucus here for this I have been pleased for several years to serve as the co-chair. Last Congress, it was with our friend Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania--a bipartisan effort involving over 130 men and women in Congress who are dedicated to efforts of animal protection.  The welfare of animals says a lot about us. Animal abuse is often a precursor to domestic violence. We find that the health and welfare of animals in our communities speak to the environmental protections. We find that people who are able to deal meaningfully with animal welfare have a chance, in many cases, to have benefits that go far beyond what you would imagine.  Animals have a capacity to have a calming influence on people. We see this as volunteers bring pet rabbits to nursing homes to be able to deal with people. Animals have a way of reducing people's blood pressure. It is a great symbiotic relationship.  Here in Congress, we have a wide variety of areas that we can work on together to advance animal protections. We have strengthened laws against animal fighting. We have raised awareness about the barbaric practice of horse soring injuring them to produce the distinctive gait. We promote humane treatment of animals in agricultural research, to be able to reduce the harmful effects on animals in production of cosmetics.  We have bipartisan legislation that would allow people to have their animals at domestic violence shelters, or for emergency services.  One of the things that was most jarring for me, illustrated by what happened with Katrina--2005 hurricane in New Orleans--that there were times where people would not abandon their home because they were afraid of what would happen to their puppy.  We have seen women who are in a situation of domestic violence refuse to leave their abuser because they are afraid of what is going to happen to their kitten that would be left behind.  I am pleased that, in this Congress, the Republican co-chair is going to be my friend Congressman Vern Buchanan from Vern brings to this issue personal passion, energy, and new ideas. And I am quite confident we will continue the efforts with the caucus to be able to promote animal welfare, promote understanding on Capitol  We have had, on a monthly basis, bipartisan briefings of legislation with Republican and Democratic cosponsors that garner broad support. And I am hopeful together that this can be, in a time when there is more than a little contention and controversy--that this is an area that we can come together to work on, on Capitol  We are supported by organizations like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Animal Welfare Institute, Born Free, The Humane Society; representative of the over 25,000 organizations across the country that are dedicated to animal protection.[[Page H886]]  I am hopeful that each of my colleagues will join us in this bipartisan effort, focus on simple commonsense things that we can do that bring us together to promote animal welfare, to be able to make all of God's creatures better off, and in so doing, reinforce our humanity.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH885-2.txt,99,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,2.0,March
4290,topic-id,4736,"Mr.President, I rise today to voice my opposition to the[[Page S2205]]nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United  The nomination of an individual to serve on the Supreme Court is a matter of tremendous importance. Supreme Court justices have the opportunity to shape, literally, and even to define American history for decades to come. Even more importantly, they have the opportunity to affect the lives and livelihoods of everyday Americans, now and in generations yet unborn.  Few decisions in the Senate have a more profound consequence than the confirmation of a nominee for a lifetime seat on the highest Court in the land. I recognize that this is one of the most critical votes that I will take or that any Senator will cast.  After reviewing Judge Gorsuch's record, I have decided to uphold my constitutional duty of service to advise and consent by opposing Judge Gorsuch's nomination at all stages of the confirmation process, including a vote on cloture or an up-or-down vote. I didn't come to this decision lightly. I arrived at this conclusion because I believe the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court must be someone who understands the importance of judicial restraint, someone who will adhere to precedent, someone who will respect and has respect for all coequal branches of government, someone who views the Constitution as a living--not a static--document, someone whose judicial views actually fall within the mainstream of judicial thought and jurisprudence, and someone who has a deep understanding of the law, the Constitution, and its applications. Critically, I believe the next Supreme Court justice must be someone who understands the gravity of their work--that their decisions will affect livelihoods, will affect lives, and will affect the liberties and the rights that we value--not just for those in places of privilege and power but for all American citizens, for all of the people, now and for decades to come.  The American people need the next Justice on the Nation's highest Court to be someone who will protect the rights for all--for everyone--and who will ensure that the words literally inscribed above the Supreme Court--``Equal Justice Under Law''--are made manifest in everyone's life.  After careful consideration of Judge Gorsuch's record, his judicial philosophy, and after meeting with the nominee and examining remarks and answers to questions in his confirmation hearing, I do not believe Judge Gorsuch meets this high standard, and I cannot support his nomination to be a Supreme Court  Judge Gorsuch is truly a well-credentialed jurist, but we must understand that a good resume is the beginning and not the end point of a standard by which we must measure nominees to serve on the Supreme A good resume is necessary, but it is not sufficient to be on the highest Court of the land.  When it comes to the Supreme Court, the Senate's duty to advise and consent means more than merely measuring an aptitude or understanding of the law. It means more than just looking at someone's college and law school. It means more than just admiring: Does this person have an impressive resume? It necessitates an understanding of it. It actually necessitates an empathy for how these decisions will affect the lives of everyday Do they have the capacity to stand for all of us?  I take literally the way the Constitution began. It began with the words in the preamble to the In many ways, it is a direct point at what is at stake when we nominate an individual to the Supreme It is a critical way that we began. It begins by saying: ``We the People.'' The inclusion of these words at the start of one of our Nation's founding documents is actually no accident. It was the subject of consternation and even discussion and debate.  It is worth noting that the original draft of the preamble of the Constitution of the United States, as prepared by a man named Gouverneur Morris, had a different beginning. It said: We the people of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and so forth. But Morris and other drafters of the Constitution made the conclusion--and, really, the conscious decision--to remove references to States, to bring it back to the people--that the power of government is derived by the people and that is the fundamental aspect of our society; that it is ``we the people''--not people of any one State, not people of any one religion, not people of any one race or class, but ``we the people''--all of the people.  In a debate about this change, it was James Madison who argued:       In this particular respect the distinction between the      existing and the proposed governments is very material. The      existing system has been derived from the dependent      derivative authority of the legislatures of the states;      whereas, this is derived from the superior power of the      people.  It is a deference and it is a reverence for the understanding of the power of the people--all people. It is no accident that this is how our Constitution began, and it is the spirit in our Nation which has helped us for centuries to expand upon this ideal of ``we the people.''  Understand this: Some of our greatest leaders fought to make sure that these ideals were far vaster, far more inclusive. I note, for instance, that Susan Anthony said it was ``we the people''--not we the White male citizens, not we the male citizens, but we the whole people who formed the And we formed it not to give the blessings of liberty but to secure them, not to the half of ourselves and to the half of our prosperity but to the whole people--women and men. You see, this fundamental understanding of our Constitution expanded to be more inclusive, to include women and minorities and religious minorities. This conception of ``we the people'' is critical.  It is unfortunate that too often, even with the best intentions, our elected officials, Supreme Court Justices, and even Presidents have forgotten the precision of these words which were chosen. But despite this, because of heroes like Susan Anthony and others, the people of this Nation have remembered them, and our Nation has grown to be who we are now. We often actually take for granted the critical role the Supreme Court has played in focusing on the people--on all the people. This has been the power and majesty of the Supreme Court--this focusing of individual rights, the dignity, the worth, the value of all people.  In the Supreme Court case in Hammer v. Dagenhart, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the power to enact labor laws that protect children. They remembered ``we the people''--in this case, citizens against powerful corporations.  In West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a State minimum wage law, again, focusing on the people--``we the people.''  In Mapp v. Ohio, when the Supreme Court decided about evidence obtained through the illegal search--the violation of individual privacy--they remembered, again, ``we the people.''  In New York Times v. Sullivan, when the Supreme Court protected the rights of everyday citizens to criticize their government, they remembered that sovereignty, that power, that importance of ``we the people.''  In Baker v. Carr, when the Supreme Court established the principle of one person, one vote, they remembered ``we the people.''  There are so many of the rulings during the 1950s and 1960s governing issues of race in our Nation, to which so many of us in our Nation owe our very success, the opportunity that was expanded because the Supreme Court--against social mores, against laws of States--focused on ``we the people.''  Perhaps most famous of those is Brown v. Board of Education, when the Supreme Court asserted that separate but equal had no place in the education of our children, and they remembered ``we the people.''  In Loving v. Virginia, when the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the State laws that banned interracial marriage--that ideal of being able to join in union with someone you love, regardless of race--the Supreme Court remembered ``we the people.''  In Olmstead v. L.C., when the Supreme Court reinforced the right of people with developmental disabilities to live in the community and not be institutionalized, they saw a greater inclusion of all They remembered ``we the people.''  I stood on the Supreme Court steps and I sat in on the Supreme Court arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, when[[Page S2206]]the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that State laws cannot stop you from marrying whom you love. They remembered. They saw the dignity and the worth of all of the people and ensured that equality. They remembered ``we the people.''  In each of these cases, so much was at stake--the rights of workers, the rights of children, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of minorities, the rights of women, voting rights, civil rights, our rights--American rights. The Supreme Court, with jurists on the right and the left, jurists appointed by Republicans and Democrats, looked to people and affirmed dignity and worth and well-being.  But these are not just issues that were done in the past. The Supreme Court is going to be again confronted by historic and deeply consequential cases. There is still so much at stake, and that is why this decision before the Senate is so consequential. The right to gain access to birth control, the right to criticize your elected officials, the right to marry someone you love--that is still at stake.  I cannot vote in support of a nominee whom I don't trust to protect American individuals, to understand the expansive nature of that idea of ``we the people.'' Judge Gorsuch is someone who, in his own words, has said judges should try to ``apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward.'' Based on his record and his writing, it is clear to me that Judge Gorsuch's own judicial philosophy leaves out critically important elements of democratic governance.  Judge Gorsuch's evasive answers to questions during his confirmation hearing didn't do anything to allay my concerns. ``We the People'' are the first words of the These words, I fear based on Judge Gorsuch's record, are not his greatest consideration. In fact, at times, when he issues his judicial opinions, they look as if those individuals that make up our society--``we the people''--are the least of his considerations.  Take for example, Alphonse Maddin, the man who was working through the night in the dead of winter as a truckdriver when his brakes unfortunately froze on him. Knowing the danger of continuing to drive with frozen brakes--the danger to himself and other motorists on the road--Alphonse pulled over to the side of the road and called for help.  As several of my colleagues have noted in Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing and on the floor, Alphonse waited over 2 hours in the freezing cold without heat, experiencing systems of hypothermia. After no help arrived, Alphonse feared for his life, and, ultimately, left his trailer to find help.  Less than a week after the incident, Alphonse was fired for abandoning his trailer. He filed a complaint with the Department of Labor and the case was brought to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where all but one of the judges ruled in favor of Alphonse--a guy who made a practical decision, an urgent decision, to save his own life and not risk the lives of others. But the judge who ruled against this individual, in favor of the corporation, was Judge Neil  He chose to save his own life and protect the lives of others who had been put in harm's way if he chose another option, and he was fired for it. Every judge on the Tenth Circuit supported that decision except for Judge  ``We the people'' includes Luke, a student with a disability. He was diagnosed with autism at the age of 2. When Luke entered kindergarten, he began receiving specialized educational services from a school district as ensured by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or Congress debated and passed, with Republicans and Democrats, an act that says children with disabilities are entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education.  Between kindergarten and the second grade, Luke achieved many of the goals of his individualized education program. But when Luke's family moved to Colorado and he enrolled in a new public school, he had trouble adjusting, and Luke regressed in areas in which he had previously done well. To better suit Luke's needs, his parents, who tried to get him better care, eventually withdrew him from his local school and enrolled him in a private residential school for children with autism. His parents sought reimbursement for the costs of that private school, but the public school district refused to pay. By the time Luke's case reached the Tenth Circuit, a Federal judge and two administrative courts had agreed that the school district should pay because Luke did not receive the free and appropriate education to which he was entitled.  The question for Judge Gorsuch was, What constitutes an appropriate education? In that ruling, Judge Gorsuch wrote the opinion saying that the educational benefits mandated by IDEA must be ``merely more than de minimis.'' That was the standard that he set for one of our American children. Because the school district gave Luke a merely more than de minimis education, Judge Gorsuch ruled that Luke's parents were not entitled to reimbursement.  But just two weeks ago, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Judge Gorsuch's ``merely more than de minimis'' standard. They unanimously rejected Judge Gorsuch's standard as contrary to the intent of In fact, at the very moment when Judge Gorsuch testified before the Judiciary Committee, Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion rejecting Gorsuch's IDEA standard, saying:       When all is said and done, a student offered an educational      program providing ``merely more than de minimis'' progress      from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an      education at all.  Judge Gorsuch's misinterpretation of the law--depriving a child with a disability of the education he deserves--should be cause for concern to any of my colleagues as they are promoting him to the highest Court in the land. It is this idea that the powerless, who fight against these corporations or big institutions and turn to the court system as their avenue to get the equal justice under the law that will view them--whether it is a corporation, whether it is a government--as an equal under the law and give them their right to be heard.  This is what ``we the people'' is. It means people like Alphonse Maddin and Luke, whom Judge Gorsuch ruled against. It also means female workers who want access to contraceptive coverage but were denied by their employer, denied by a corporation. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the people and for the corporation.  ``We the people'' means those millions of Americans who rely on Planned Parenthood centers for healthcare. Judge Gorsuch ruled against those people seeking what, in some counties, is their only access to contraceptive care. ``We the people'' means the people harmed by a medical device manufacturer's urging of unsafe, off-label uses. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the people injured and for the manufacturers, for the corporation.  ``We the people'' means that a worker fatally electrocuted while on the job due to inadequate training, whose families sought justice--Judge Gorsuch ruled against the individual and for the corporation.  ``We the people'' means the woman prevented from suing for sexual harassment, not because sexual harassment didn't exist but because she didn't report it quickly enough. Judge Gorsuch supported the corporation against the woman.  ``We the people'' means a transgender woman who is denied access to a bathroom at work. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the individual in favor of the corporation.  ``We the people'' means that every single American deserves to have their civil rights, deserves to have their equality protected by the judicial branch, which is often their last avenue toward justice. It is often their last hope against the powerful, against the wealthy. But Judge Gorsuch's record in everything--from workers' rights to women's rights, to civil rights, to the rights of children with disabilities, to the rights of a guy on the side of a highway to save his own life--suggests that he has forgotten perhaps the most important element of the Constitution: It exists to protect and serve the American people, not corporations, not lobbyists, not those rich enough to hire big, fancy law firms. It doesn't exist to serve a political ideology. It exists to serve ``we the people.''  I am not confident in Judge Gorsuch's ability as a Supreme Court[[Page S2207]]Justice to safeguard the rights and liberties of all Americans, to prioritize judicial restraint over judicial ideology, to ensure equal justice under the law, and to understand and act in a way that indicates that the lives of real people who are struggling against often seemingly insurmountable odds--that for them, everything is on the line. I am not sure that Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court can honor this tradition.  ``We the people'' means an independent judiciary that will not close the courthouse doors on people, on our civil rights--that will not look at litigants as just pawns in the larger ideological context of ideas but will see the humanity of every American; that will have a courageous empathy to understand their circumstances and their struggles and put that in accordance with the values of a nation where we all swear an oath for liberty and justice for all the people.  Over 75 years ago, Justice Hugo Black encompassed the basic ideal of the role of Federal courts in protecting citizens' rights when he wrote these words:       No higher duty, or more solemn responsibility, rests upon      this Court, than that of translating into living law and      maintaining this constitutional shield deliberately planned      and inscribed for the benefit of every human being subject to      our Constitution--of whatever race, creed or persuasion.  Yet Judge Gorsuch's own writings demonstrate a failure to grasp this understanding of the role of courts to protect all people--and I quote, again, Justice Black--``whatever race, creed, or persuasion.''  In an opinion article for the National Review, entitled ``Liberals and Lawsuits,'' Judge Gorsuch expressed his skepticism about civil rights litigation as merely a pursuit of a ``social agenda.'' He wrote:       American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom,      relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and      the ballot box, as the primary means for effecting their      social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted      suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.       This overweening addiction to the courtroom as a place to      debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the      judiciary.  I wonder what Oliver Brown, plaintiff in the seminal case of Brown v. Board of Education would say to Judge Gorsuch? Was he ``addicted'' to the courtroom to advance his social agenda? Or was the courtroom his avenue to justice against profound oppression?  I wonder what James Obergefell would say to Judge Was he ``addicted'' to the courtroom when he sought to be able to marry the person he loved? Or did Oliver just want to bring the truth to the idea that separate but equal was actually discriminatory, demeaning, and degrading, not just to the individuals who are discriminated against but demeaning to us as a people and a nation?  Judge Gorsuch's actions call into question whether he understands the proper role of the courts. Does he understand that Federal courts are the proper forum for constitutional disputes that protect American's basic rights? This is not about liberal or democrat; this is about individuals who are often fighting battles against powerful interests.  It was the journalist and editor William Allen White who said in 1936:       Liberty . . . must be something more than a man's      conception of his rights, much more than his desire to fight      for his own rights. True liberty is founded upon a lively      sense of the rights of others and a fighting conviction that      the rights of others must be maintained.  I do not believe Judge Gorsuch possesses this ``fighting conviction'' that we need in a Supreme Court Justice to forcefully and fearlessly, without regard to politics or favor or privilege or wealth, protect the rights of others, to protect the rights of all Americans, to protect the rights of ``we the people.'' I do not believe that Judge Gorsuch will work to fiercely defend the rights of all I do not believe he possesses that fighting conviction that ``we the people'' must be committed above all else to one another.  Again, I do not take the decision to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination lightly. I understand what is at stake. I am fortunate to represent hard-working New Jerseyans in the U.Senate, and when I took the oath to support and defend the Constitution, I made a promise to my constituents and the American people not to only discharge my duties but at every opportunity to work across the aisle, to protect their rights and interests. That means a lot to me.  So many of my proudest moments in the Senate are from this bipartisan cooperation that I have found with so many of my colleagues. I do not stand here today to question their motives. I do not stand here today to impugn them in any way because when I go home, people are not concerned about the partisan politics. They are concerned about their lives, their livelihoods--about the issues that affect them and their families, their neighborhoods, their community. They want people in this body and in the courts across the street to protect the rights of Americans, protect consumers, protect our kids and our environment, but this is, in fact, what I believe the nominee we are all considering has shown that he will not do.  It is no secret that Judge Gorsuch's nomination comes at a very divisive time for this body and a challenging time for this country. We have experienced great times of turmoil and polarization before in this Nation and in this body. In the Federalist Papers, written over two centuries ago, James Madison warns in Federalist Paper 10 about what he calls the ``mischiefs of faction'' and its inevitability--that citizens of the Nation and their political parties will undoubtedly disagree and will possess competing interests. Madison asserted that the existence of the legislative branch would guard against some of the worst effects of this reality. He wrote that those elected to represent the American people in the legislature would be those ``whose wisdom may best discern the true interests of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to a temporary or partial consideration.''  When this body is at its best, I believe that is true. I have seen that kind of partnership in this body. But I am afraid that we are indeed at a troubling time--a troubling time in history for the Senate where it seems that the reverse of Madison's hopes have become reflective of the truth we are experiencing because we are now facing a vote on a Supreme Court nominee whose confirmation, I believe, would be a sacrifice to temporary and partial considerations as opposed to the larger interests of our country.  In my short time in the body--just over 3\1/2\ years--I have come to this floor to speak on the nominations of two different Supreme Court Justices to serve here in the United The first was Judge Merrick He was not only well qualified, intelligent, and capable, he was moderate. President Obama even sought input from Republicans about choosing someone who was a mainstream jurist. He was more than qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, but he was actually someone who could bring folks together. His qualifications, his aptitude to serve, and his moderate philosophy were not reflected in how we dealt with that nomination.  I believe he deserved an up-or-down vote. Even if it was a 60-vote threshold, he deserved an up-or-down vote. More than that, he should have had the opportunity to meet with Senators, Republican and Democratic, like Gorsuch has met with Senators, Republican and He deserved to have a committee hearing. He deserved to be voted on up or down in that committee, and he deserved to have his nomination come to the floor. Whether a 60-vote threshold or a 50-vote threshold, he deserved an up-or-down vote, but he did not get one.  The Garland nomination was the bookend to an era we have been experiencing, that I have been witnessing, of obstruction, and there has been finger-pointing on both sides. But let's be clear about what happened during the Obama administration. During President Obama's time in office, we saw historic obstruction like never before. Seventy-nine of President Obama's judicial nominees were blocked by the filibusters. Seventy-nine nominees were blocked at a time when the judiciary, an independent branch of government, was saying: We are in judicial crisis in many jurisdictions. Seventy-nine of Obama's judges were blocked, compared to 68 nominees obstructed under all Presidents combined. All of the obstruction from Democrats and[[Page S2208]]Republicans and other parties, and only 68 nominees were obstructed, compared to President Obama, where there were 79.  I do not possess the same view as those who last year believed this seat should remain vacant and took the obstruction during the Obama Presidency to a much higher level. I believe that seat should have been filled not by an extreme jurist but by someone who could have tempered the partisanship of our time, someone who could have brought us together. It was a wise choice at a divisive time in our country.  President Obama did not choose somebody from further left; he chose a moderate Justice who probably could have--if he had been given an up-or-down vote--commanded 60 votes. At this time, that is what President Trump should have done--put forward a nominee who could have brought this country together, a moderate nominee, someone within the judicial mainstream. But he hasn't.  I believe a 60-vote threshold right now is more than appropriate at this moment in history. There are Republican judicial nominees who could garner 60 votes in this The 60-vote threshold exists because a person confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court at this time should be mainstream and independent enough to garner that two-thirds support.  The 60-vote threshold exists because confirmation of a Justice to the Supreme Court is one of the most important duties we perform, one of the most important positions in all of American It is someone who will have an impact on our society, shaping it and forming it for generations to come.  This President should have sought real advice and consent from the entire Senate, but instead he turned to the judicial extreme.  Now more than ever, we need a threshold that can pull our nominees back to the mainstream, that can begin to heal the divisions. I do not believe it is in the best interests of my constituents or the American people to confirm someone so extreme on a 50-vote margin. It should be 60 votes.  I urge my colleagues to understand that this judge threatens those ideals we hold precious, those words at the very beginning of our Constitution, ``We the People.'' I urge people to understand that this is the time more than ever that we must continue to fight to defend the marginalized, the weak, the people who do not possess wealth, the people who are standing against powerful corporations, that we cannot reverse a tradition where our courts were the main societal avenue in which people could receive equal justice under the law. We cannot put someone in office who has shown throughout their judicial record to be contrary to that.  For the sake of this body, now more than ever, it is my hope that we can see a judicial nominee who will help to heal wounds and not create them, help to elevate the unity of us as a people, who will help to affirm the ideals of our Nation and the very conception that we are one people, we are one Nation, and we hold one destiny.

4076,topic-id,1824,"Mr.President, I appreciate your flexibility during Senator Hatch's speech. I thank Senator Duckworth and Senator Cortez Masto for their evolving leadership and for their passion about these issues.                      Nomination of Steven Mnuchin  Mr.President, I listened to Senator Hatch for many moments not so many moments ago, and I was pretty struck by his analysis of these two nominees who are about to come forward, Mr.Mnuchin and Congressman I was struck by Senator Hatch's suggestions of their high ethics and honesty and ability to serve in these two exalted--he is right about that part--exalted Cabinet posts, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman Price, and the Secretary of Treasury, Mr. What struck me is that I was sitting in the same committee room as our respected chairman, Senator Hatch, and I heard these two nominees lie to the committee--lie to the committee; not sort of a Trumpian lie, not kind of at the edges, misspeaking or confusing things, but outright lied.  Mr.Mnuchin forgot that he had a $100 million investment, I believe somewhere in the I don't know if too many staff here or even too many of my fellow Members who are better off than most of the country financially--I don't know too many people who would forget they had a $100 million investment somewhere. He forgot to tell the committee that. That was pretty bad, but then he told the committee, in an answer to a question from me, that his bank, OneWest, where he was the CEO for a period of years, that they didn't do any robo-signings. Robo-signings are a way that his bank staff signed document after document after document, very quickly, without looking at those documents, and then ended up causing foreclosures in my Hundreds of people in my State lost their homes because of OneWest robo-signings, and he told the committee that he didn't do robo-signings until later.  The Columbus Dispatch, the most conservative newspaper in my State--a newspaper that almost never endorses a Democrat and a newspaper that has generally supported President Trump on most issues; sort of like when one bird flies off a telephone wire, they all do--and they talked about how Mr.Mnuchin lied to the Finance  So Senator Hatch talks about their integrity and what great public servants they are, except they lied to his committee.  My wife and I live in ZIP Code 44105, Cleveland, That doesn't mean much to people listening, but my ZIP Code 10 years ago--my ZIP Code, in the first half of 2007, had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of So I take that personally when somebody comes in front of me and in front of a U.Senate committee and in front of the American people and lies about something he did that turned hundreds, if not thousands, in Ohio--we still don't have enough information about it--turned their lives upside down.  Imagine when you are foreclosed on--you probably can't if it hasn't happened to you. It hasn't happened to me, but I have heard people tell their stories. You go to your children and you say: We are going to have to move, honey. You are going to have to move school districts. I don't know where we are going to live. I don't know where your friends are going to be; you are going to be far from your friends. We have to move because our house has been foreclosed on. I was paying the mortgage, but this bank called OneWest did this to us.  So that is 1.  Then Congressman Price kind of didn't tell the committee the truth, either. You could say ``lie'' or you could use whatever term you want to use.  ``Tom Price got a privileged offer to buy a biomedical stock at a discount, the company's official said, contrary to his congressional testimony.''  This is sort of Wall Street Journal language for ``lie'' because he said this, and it said contrary to his testimony. In Cleveland, OH, or in Garfield Heights or in Cincinnati, we would say lie. They want to dress it up because they wouldn't want one of their people to be accused of something.  Congressman Price--I am pretty amazed. I know President Trump, Candidate Trump talked about draining the swamp. Draining the swamp--he says that, but it really does look like the White House is an executive retreat for Goldman Sachs, a retreat for Goldman Sachs executives and the people he has hired in the White  To hire two people who have these kinds of ethics--Congressman Price as a Member of Congress, a prominent Member of Congress in the House, as a Congressman working on health care issues, he bought and sold health care stocks profiting from it. In one case he got this special privileged offer that most people didn't get, and then he lied to the committee about it. That is bad enough, but look what he wants to be the Secretary of. He wants to be the Secretary of Health and Human Why does that matter? Here is why it matters.  He has these views on Medicare that are so out of step with the country. For instance, he said in July 30, 2009, ``Nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.'' That sounds like the John Birch Society, 1965, when Medicare passed, overwhelmingly in the end because everybody saw how good it was, but they opposed it because it was socialism or some such term they used to describe Medicare.[[Page S981]]  I don't know too many people who actually receive Medicare--unless they are Members of Congress who really think that Medicare is socialism. Medicare has worked for--back in 1965--Senator Durbin doesn't remember this as a Member of the Senate, but he remembers this figure I am going to give. In 1965, when LBJ signed Medicare, 50 percent of Americans 65 and older had no health insurance. Today that 50 percent has shrunk to less than 1 percent of Americans that age don't have health insurance. Think about that progress and what this means.  Congressman Price wants to be the head of He wants to be the head of He wants to be the head of the agency that is going implement the Affordable Care Act if he can't repeal it. Think about this. He wants to privatize He wants to voucherize it. He has voted consistently for Republican budgets in the House to do that.  Do you know what else he wants to do that is particularly offensive to me? It is offensive because we sit here and we dress well and we have good titles and we get paid well and we have insurance funded by taxpayers. He wants to raise the eligibility age for  Look around my The Presiding Officer grew up not far from where I live in Cleveland, He knows his adopted State way better, but he knows my State still, and he knows what this means. If you are a barber in Garfield Heights, you have to wait until 67, or even 70, according to Congressman Price, before you are eligible to draw If you are a carpenter in Westlake, OH, you have to wait until you are 67 or 70 to draw If you are working construction in Lima, OH, or if you are working a manufacturing plant in Mansfield, OH, if you are working retail in Cincinnati, OH, if you live in Zanesville and you wait tables in a diner, you are going to wait until you are 67 or 70 until you can draw  That is what Congressman Price wants to do. Not only are his ethics challenged--that should be reason enough he should step aside. Buying and selling stocks, health care stocks as a Member of Congress while you are voting and helping those companies, that is bad enough, but what he wants to do to maybe the greatest program in American history, Medicare, is much, much worse because that affects people in those towns I mentioned--in Garfield Heights, Westlake, Zanesville, Cincinnati, and Mansfield, all over.  I hope I am healthy enough to continue working and continue serving in the The voters, obviously, would have to say that between now and then. I hope I can work until I am 67 or 70 in this job. I know a lot of people who work outside who are on their feet all day, who work with their arms and shoulders. They can't work until they are 67 or 70. It is immoral for Members of this body to support a candidate, to support somebody or to vote for something like this that will raise the Medicare eligibility age.  I will close with this. I was in Youngstown one day at a townhall. A woman stood up. She was clearly in her early sixties. It turns out I could calculate her age from what she said. She put her hand up, she stood up, and I called on her. There were about 200 people there. She said: I work two jobs. I don't make a lot of money. I am getting by with two jobs. Neither of my jobs has health insurance. She said: I am 63. My goal in life--think about this. The pages, they are not thinking a lot about Medicare, but my colleagues think about this. She said: I am 63. My goal in life is to live 18 months more so I can get  Think about that. Her life is such that her goal in life isn't to get to know her grandchildren better or help her kids out or maybe take a trip to New York City or even Cleveland, her goal in life is to live long enough to have  I would like Congressman Price to meet her and Congressman Price to say: Well, lady, you know, your goal in life needs to be you can live 3\1/2\ more years so you can be 67 or 70 to get this. Think about the morality of this.  Congressman Price, I know him. I don't know him well. He is a nice enough guy. Voting for somebody who wants to raise the Medicare eligibility age, that to me is immoral. It shows how out of touch--I am guessing that most of my colleagues who will vote for Congressman Price have never sat down with somebody who would think it is a really bad idea, not to mention immoral, to raise the Medicare eligibility age.  I plan to join a lot of my colleagues in voting no on Congressman I think it is the wrong move for our country. I think it is the wrong move for particularly seniors in this country who depend on Medicare and on Medicaid, people of all ages. It is clearly the wrong move for our country.

4081,topic-id,1854,"Mr.President, I come to speak on the nomination of Congressman Price to lead the Health and Human Services But I have to respond to my colleague from Texas on his remarks. He wanted to know why Members of our side of the aisle wanted to have information about nominees or why it might take so long.  There are a record number of billionaires in this There is nothing wrong with people making money. But when you have conflicts of interest, clearly people on this side of the aisle feel like we should do our job and find out about those conflicts of interest. Even in record time, these nominees have moved through this body, coming to votes in committee without our even having all of this information that we wanted to have on their conflicts of interest.  For one nominee, the Commerce Secretary, we were negotiating even the day of the vote to clarify whether he was going to recuse himself if any of his transport vessels ever entered U.waters and would have a conflict on the Oil Spill Liability Trust  So there is the notion that somehow we have been dragging our feet on a Cabinet, when a billionaire Cabinet has been nominated by this President, who seems to want to tweet against commerce. The conflicts are here, and we want them cleared up.  As to Mr.Price, there are issues here that even the committee was not given the chance for a second hearing to get information about his conflicts of interest. So for my colleague--who thinks for a party that railroaded Zoe Baird because of a housekeeping issue, and yet there are nominees that we have moved forward on who have the[[Page S986]]same issue--now to say to us that we don't have the right to find out what these conflicts of interest are, I would say that you are wrong.  On this issue for Mr.Price, my issue is the issue of our health care delivery system, which was very hard to pin him down on as it relates to the Affordable Care My view is that this vote is the first vote in the repeal of the Affordable Care Why? Because Mr.Price held nothing but his own views about this before coming to our committee.  When we asked repeatedly what would he endorse as it related to the reforms in the Affordable Care Act that are saving Americans money, that are clearly working for Americans, he failed to make a commitment. So my newspaper in Washington State, the Seattle Times, has said: ``President-elect Donald Trump and his nominee for U.Secretary of Health and Human Services have doubled down on Republican promises to scuttle the Affordable Care Act (ACA).''  So that is not what I want. That is not what I am going to vote for in the nomination of Mr.If Mr.Price had given us a little bit of an inkling of his desire to work across the aisle on what is working in the Affordable Care Act, what is working in Medicaid expansion, what is working to help save Americans dollars on their health care, it would be a different discussion here. But Mr.Price has put forth a budget in the House of Representatives that would cut Medicaid by one-third within 10 years. His budget cuts $1 trillion from States over a 10-year period of time.  So this philosophy has raised a lot of concerns by my colleagues here. We had no other choice but to look at his record since he would not give us any answers on these programs. His record clearly shows that he has actively and aggressively worked to cap Medicaid with a block-grant program; trade away Medicare's guarantees with a voucher, instead; defund Planned Parenthood; and switch guaranteed benefits for a fixed tax credit that would steadily buy less and less and less and become more of a standard of actually giving Americans less health care.  Why is this so important? The reality is that 7 percent of Americans get their health insurance through the individual health insurance market, and that while people talk about the exchanges, the expansion of Medicaid, which so many States took advantage of, is a critical program. Nationally, nearly half of pregnant women depend on Medicaid for prenatal and postnatal care to ensure healthy pregnancies.  Medicaid covers 64 percent of nursing home residents and is the largest payer for long-term care. Many Americans in the United States are now going into nursing homes because they can't afford to save for retirement. Medicaid is critically important. In hospitals across the Nation, one in two births are financed by Medicaid insurance actually costs less than private insurance. So, it is a very efficient way to cover a population.  I know a lot of my colleagues are going to come out here and talk about I am sure seniors in America will be very anxious about Mr.Price's statements on But I am speaking here now about a program that is keeping people off of uncompensated care, keeping them from flooding our hospitals, and putting them on a system that is working for our Nation to cover people who need to have an option.  Now, I say ``option.'' Why? Because Medicaid itself is an optional program. States don't have to participate. But guess what. Every State in this country does participate. In fact, in Washington State, we know that Medicaid reduces, as I said, infant mortality. It helps with long-term health care, and it is helping us make sure we are becoming more efficient in our delivery system.  So in Washington, we expanded Medicaid and covered 600,000 additional Washingtonians, most of whom were previously insured. It helped us reduce our uninsured rate by 60 percent, to less than 6 percent; that is, 6 percent of Washingtonians are now not with a health insurance program.  So why am I so concerned about this? Because in the Affordable Care Act, reforms are working. We would like a nominee who would at least address and agree that those things are working. For example, as I just mentioned, because the Medicaid population and long-term care costs are rising, and the number of people are living longer, they are going to drive a huge balloon into our Medicaid budget. So we came up with an idea of saying: You should ``rebalance'' from nursing home care to community-based care.  Why? Because people would like to live in their homes longer, because we can deliver more affordable care that way. It is better for the patient, and it is better for our health care delivery system. So what did we do? We put incentives into the Affordable Care Act to give the patients a cheaper, more affordable way to stay in their homes and get long-term care.  It is really amazing to me how many States in our Union took up the opportunity to participate in this program: Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Illinois, Maine, Ohio, Nevada, Massachusetts, Nebraska, and  All of those States decided to use this part of the Affordable Care Act because they agreed in philosophy that taking this population and rebalancing would save dollars in Medicaid, give people better health care choices, and save us money overall. In fact, the State of Georgia received $57 million from the Affordable Care Act to do this and has been able to shift 10 percent of its long-term care costs from nursing home care to community-based care with the help of this program. So it is a winning strategy.  Yet we could not get a commitment or an awareness by Mr.Price about this program, what it does, why it is so successful, or the concept that having people get care in their homes would be appropriate for so many Americans over the very expensive nursing home care that so many States are burdened with and so much of our Federal dollars are going to be burdened with in the future.  We also tried to discuss with him another incredible idea from the Affordable Care Act; that is, the Basic Health Plan: the idea that customers should be able to buy in bulk. I call it the Costco plan, because everybody knows that when you buy in bulk, you are going to get a discount.  But beyond the Medicaid eligibility level, so much of what Americans have not been able to do is to buy in bulk. So part of the Affordable Care Act said that you could buy in bulk as a State and give a benefit.  What is the outcome of that? Well, the State of New York is using the Basic Health Plan and has signed up more than a half million people under that plan.  Right now, a family of four in New York making about $37,000 a year, if they were buying just on the exchange, might have to pay $1,500 in annual premiums, with tax credits. Because of the Basic Health Plan, they are paying about $250 per year in premiums. That is a savings of over $1,000 per year for those families. This is an important program. Why? Because those in the delivery system have certainty that they are going to see those patients, just as Costco, when they buy in bulk for so many Americans across the country, knows that Americans are going to shop there and take advantage of the discount that they were able to negotiate, and it works for everyone. The producers know they will have volume, the customer knows they will get the best price, and more people are covered.  The fact that New York has used the Basic Health Plan, as well as Minnesota, has shown us that these kinds of expansions of Medicaid--and programs like the Basic Health Plan that exist just above the Medicaid eligibility rate--work successfully for us and are the types of things we wish Mr.Price would endorse. But, again, he failed to endorse these kinds of things.  What he has said, instead, is that he wants to cap these programs, which is not an improvement to the system but almost a truncating of the cost. In my mind, it is like a surgeon going into surgery but instead of taking a scalpel, he is taking an ax.  Given what the people of Washington State have done successfully in driving down health care costs and improving outcomes, I am not willing to take a risk on somebody who will not take a risk and say that these programs are working successfully.[[Page S987]]  I hope our colleagues will listen to these concerns. This is the first vote in the dismantling of the Affordable Care It is the first opportunity we have to say: Either tell us what is working or tell us what you are for.  But on Mr.Price, all we have is his record. And I hate to say, his record, by capping and desiring to cut Medicaid and Medicare, is not the direction our country needs to go.

4156,topic-id,318,"Mr.President, I want to underscore one point here because people watching this may not understand the specific request that Senator McCain made.  What Senator McCain asked is that this resolution be brought to the floor of the U.Senate with debate and vote. Every Member can voice their views and then vote up or down. Senator McCain is absolutely right: On a vote there are going to be 97, 98, maybe even more Senators voting in favor of this resolution. I hope it is 100 at the end of the day. But we have one Senator objecting to the consideration.  We have to have some democratic principles here. This is a national security issue. I think we should underscore the point of what Senator McCain was requesting. He didn't ask unanimous consent that it be passed; it is unanimous consent that we have a chance to vote on it.  Each of us could have cast our vote and expressed our views. We are not denying any Senator the right to be heard on this issue or to cast their vote on this issue. It is disappointing that one Senator is holding this issue up, and it is affecting our national security.  I yield the floor.

4293,topic-id,1544,"Mr.President, last week on this Senate floor, I made the case for Democrats and Republicans joining together to confirm one of the most qualified individuals ever nominated to the U.Supreme I was referring, of course, to Chief Judge Merrick  I don't wish to belabor the point here this evening, but it bears repeating that Judge Garland brought with him more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United  It bears repeating that Judge Garland is an extraordinary man, a good man, a brilliant man, a fair judge, and a consensus builder on the bench in a day and age when we need consensus builders on the Supreme Court and other courts across the country. Frankly, we also need them right here on this floor, in this body.  It bears repeating that the obstruction of Judge Garland's nomination was unprecedented in the history of the United States of America and in the history of the  Since the Senate Judiciary Committee began holding public hearings on Supreme Court nominations in 1916, no Supreme Court nominee had ever been denied a hearing and a vote--until Judge Many of our Republican colleagues refused to meet with him. When his nomination expired at noon on January 3, 2017, 293 days had passed--293 wasted days.  A good man was treated badly. I believe our Constitution was treated badly. I believe that the obstruction of Judge Garland's nomination was unprecedented. I believe it was shameful. From my view, we cannot pretend that this vacant seat on the Supreme Court--what I believe should be Judge Garland's seat--is anything other than blatant partisanship.  I believe that upholding my oath to protect the Constitution means finding agreement on moving Judge Garland's nomination forward at the same time--at the same time as that of Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's Supreme Court nominee.  I have no choice but to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination this week because anything else would be a stamp of approval for what I believe is playing politics with Supreme Court nominees. I cannot support Judge Gorsuch's nomination because we cannot have one set of rules for Democratic Presidents and another set of rules for Republican  Some of my colleagues and maybe some of the Americans listening at home tonight may be asking themselves: Well, Senator Carper, didn't the Democrats change the rules for judges when they were in the majority? That is a fair question. To that, I would say yes. That is true for lower court nominees, nominees to Federal district courts and courts of appeals.  But it wasn't because Senator Harry Reid woke up one morning and decided that was the day to change the rules of the A decision of this magnitude didn't happen on a whim. It was because, by the time November 2013 had arrived, our Republican friends had attempted to block--get this--more nominations in the first 5 years of President Obama's tenure than all other Presidents combined. Let me say that again. It was because, by the time November 2013 had arrived, our Republican friends had attempted to block more nominations in the first 5 years of President Obama's tenure than all other Presidents combined.  It wasn't the unprecedented use of cloture motions--79 cloture motions--during those 5 years that precipitated Democrats' seeking a solution to restore the capability of the Senate to do its job. It was because our Republican friends refused to consider any nominee--any nominee--to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, despite three critical vacancies on our Nation's second highest court.  So, yes, it is true that Democrats supported a change that allowed a vote on those nominees, but it was because our Republican friends took the unheard of position that no nominees--no nominees, no matter their qualifications--were entitled to a vote.  I should note that Democrats were careful to preserve the 60 votes for Supreme Court nominees.  Let me just say that, if there is any position in the Federal Government that should require at least 60 votes, my view is it should be the Supreme Court, and that is the rule under which we operate as of this moment.  One of the reasons why is because Supreme Court vacancies come around quite rarely. When they do, we need to ensure that debate is robust, we need to ensure that the nominee is from the judicial and the political mainstream, and we need to ensure that these lifetime appointments are held to the highest standards. In other words, I believe we need a nominee like Judge Merrick  Despite his own impressive resume, I have concerns with Judge Gorsuch's nomination beyond the treatment of Judge Garland, and I have concerns with the way that our debate has not been, frankly, robust. I have concerns that Judge Gorsuch's views are outside the judicial and political mainstream, and I have concerns about what others have termed ``evasiveness.'' His evasiveness before the Judiciary Committee does not meet the high standards that we should expect for those lifetime appointments.  I would be remiss if I did not mention what I referred to last week as the cloud that lingers still over President Trump's campaign. Like many Americans, I read the news related to Russia and the Trump campaign, and I come to the inescapable conclusion that the cloud is darkening and the forecast is a matter of grave concern for our  FBI Director Jim Comey has testified under oath that there is an ongoing investigation to determine the links between the Trump campaign and Russia, an adversary that attacked our election and undermined a free and fair election to change the outcome of that election. From all appearances, they did.  To hastily move forward with Judge Gorsuch--who is 49 years old, who could serve on the Supreme Court well into the middle of this century--without first getting to the bottom of the suspicious and irregular actions of Trump campaign officials would be, in my view, a mistake.[[Page S2210]]  For many Americans, this Supreme Court seat will always come with an asterisk attached to it. They believe and I believe that it was a stolen seat that belonged to Judge Merrick  Many Americans are wondering why we are rushing to fill a lifetime vacancy while President Trump's campaign remains under investigation and will for at least some while.  I believe we have some time. Judge Garland waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never came. Judge Gorsuch has waited 48 days for a hearing and many of our Republican friends would like to see him seated this week.  Again, I would say: Judge Merrick Garland waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never, never came.  What we face here today, I think, is a rush to judgment. I would just say that we have time. We ought to hit the pause button on this nomination.  The American people are watching us, and history will judge us. I fear that history may judge us poorly if anyone other than Merrick Garland is confirmed at this time. I fear that history may judge us poorly if we do not insist that the Trump campaign is first cleared of any wrongdoing before we move forward. We need to get this right. We have time to get this right.  The Senate has been through it all. The good men and women of the Senate have always disagreed--sometimes passionately, oftentimes loudly. I understand that this disagreement before us may seem irresolvable, but that is only if we seek to cut off debate and admit defeat. Personally speaking, I am not ready to do that today or this week.  I believe we have time. I believe we have the opportunity to right a historic wrong. We have not just an opportunity to right a historic wrong but also an obligation to get this right.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

4106,topic-id,671,"Mr.Speaker, this is the 49th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King,  King, Jr., was, sadly, struck down in Memphis, Tennessee, by an aberrant individual who wanted to kill him and chased him all over the country. It so happened that Memphis was the spot that he had that final opportunity.  In Memphis, there will be activities today celebrating the life of King and commitments to community service in his spirit.  Ironically, today, while it is the 49th anniversary of his assassination, it is also the 50th anniversary of his greatest speech, in my opinion. Not the ``I've Been to the Mountaintop'' speech that he made the night before in Memphis, the great speech where he said: I have been to the mountaintop, and I may not get there with you; but I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.  His greatest speech, in my opinion, was the speech at the Riverside Church in New York, in Manhattan, on April 4 of 1967, when he spoke of the three isms that bother this country and are the enemies of this country: militarism, materialism, and racism.  The speech was called ``Beyond Vietnam.'' A prescient King saw the need to get out of Vietnam, to make a unilateral step, cease the bombing, save lives. He was indeed right about that. We should have gotten out of Vietnam then, but we didn't.  It was months later that Richard Nixon interfered with the peace process for political reasons and got word to Vietnam not to participate; that they might get a better deal from Nixon; and that stopped President Johnson from possibly concluding the war in 1968.  The racism, the militarism, and the materialism are still pervasive. King wouldn't like what he sees today. We have a budget giving 56 or $57 billion extra to the military and cutting away from diplomacy efforts, foreign aid efforts that militate against war. And it takes away from funding for people, African Americans and poor people in America, who need government assistance.  That is part of what King was concerned about in this ``Beyond Vietnam'' speech. And here it is 50 years later and we still suffer with the same tight budget and the same misguided priorities.  We have an Attorney General who is looking at ending consent decrees on police violence against African Americans in Baltimore, Maryland, and also in Ferguson, a suburb of Louis,  We are going the wrong direction, and it is sad that one of our greatest prophets and one of our greatest leaders told us about it 50 years ago.  Have we learned.  The disparity in wealth is greater than ever in this country. The rich are getting richer and richer and richer. It is incomprehensible that there are billionaires--and there are lots of them out there--and that the tax breaks that we offer in the Tax Code are going to give millionaires and billionaires hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars of tax breaks at the expense of[[Page H2635]]government programs for people who don't have enough.  There is no consideration of a minimum wage. And King was strong on believing that if people worked a full-time job, they shouldn't be paid a part-time wage.                              {time}  1015  We need to go a lot further. We need to reflect on King's Riverside speech and understand that it is still a guide for us, and we need to look at a more understanding budget that cares about people first and not the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about; that we try to avoid wars through diplomacy and foreign aid and goodwill; and that we support our people with WIC programs and LIHEAP programs and Meals on Wheels and health care and public education; and that we try to give tax breaks to the middle class--large tax breaks, and not tax breaks to those who already have enough.

4202,topic-id,557,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to join you today in this 1-hour session.  I am the co-chair of the Medical Research As the co-chair, I am most aware of the need for research and how much it has helped our country and how much it has helped many cities and universities in their efforts to save us.  For a long time, I have realized that my enemy--and I am not suggesting to anybody, or I don't want anybody to get the wrong impression that I don't think that we need a military, and a strong military, but I have known that the odds of me dying from something that happens initiated by North Korea or Iran or ISIS is about nil. But I also know that the odds of my dying from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer is likely. So my enemy is disease.  And who is working to protect me and be my defense department? The National Institutes of That is my defense department. That is all of America's defense department, for we all have, as an enemy, disease. Cures and treatments will be found through grants and research coordinated through the National Institutes of  Francis Collins, the genius who is the Director of the NIH, is really our secretary of defense because he is fighting to find cures and treatments not just for us, but more so for the next generation and the next generation.  So it is a perfect situation for us to act to protect our constituents against their most serious enemy, and that is disease, and to protect them no matter how we fund it. For the deficit hawks who might suggest that some of the expenses be paid for by future generations, that is who is going to get the treatments and the cures, and people not even born yet.  In 1954, my father was a pediatrician, and he gave the Salk vaccine to second grade children for polio. He didn't give it to me in the fall of 1954 or the spring of 1954 because that wasn't his charge; it was to give it to second graders in a test of the Salk vaccine.  I came down with polio in September of 1954. And but for medical research not being a year earlier when the Salk vaccine became available to everyone in the spring of 1955, I would not have had polio.  It affected me as a young person. I spent 3 months in a hospital, lots of time with physical therapists, had surgeries, and today wear a brace because, without it, I wouldn't be standing here.  My future, I am not sure what it will be, but it would have been a lot better if we had the Salk vaccine a year earlier. For every cure and treatment that comes a little later and a little later are that many more people that will suffer from it.  So this nearly $6 billion cut is going to affect people's lives in a meaningful way. For that reason, I am proud to join Mr.Garamendi and my other colleagues here to oppose this $6 billion cut and also to advocate for increases in funding to the National Institutes of Health, our real defense department fighting for all Americans against the number one enemy we all have, which is catastrophic illnesses and diseases.

4147,topic-id,737,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about the water conditions facing California as I have for many times over thelast 6 years.  Today, obviously, we have recent storms that we welcome in Over the past several days, my district has receivedabove-average rainfall and snow in the mountains; and we welcome that. But also that presents flood conditions.  After over 5 years of record-breaking drought conditions, of course, we welcome the rain and snow; but there is[[Page H311]]alsodestructive flooding that is occurring as a result of that.  Regrettably, to reduce this potential flooding, we are having to let this water go out to the ocean. This precious watercould be extremely beneficial to farmers, farmworkers, and farm communities in the dry years. But, of course, we can't store itbecause the storage is not there.  This water could be used to replenish groundwater aquifers that were depleted during these drought conditions and could becarried over for ground storage for use in dry years. This water could help ensure that farming communities would not continueto deal with double-digit unemployment levels that we have had to face over the last 6 years.  It is why we need to invest more in the water storage projects in California, both surface storage and groundwater recharge,like raising the gates at Exchequer Dam, building Sites Reservoir and Temperance Flat  The WIIN Act that we passed last month was enacted in December, and it provides funding for water storage authorization andfor groundwater banking projects. And just in the last several weeks, we have determined that over 130,000 acre-feet of water isavailable today for use in our farm communities that otherwise would not be available.  It is my sincere hope that those projects and others like this, like the Los Banos Creek Reservoir and raising San LuisReservoir, are advanced as rapidly as possible in the next administration so that we can begin to capture the much-needed waterthat comes from these storms as we have had in the last 10 days.  Fixing California's broken water system requires a multiprong approach, as I have said many times on this floor, andfocusing on how we improve the water infrastructure and storage capacity will be imperative as we work together to updateCalifornia's water system, both here in Congress with the new administration and with the administration in Sacramento that isalso trying to create a water system that serves California's needs in the 21st century.  After 5 years of devastating drought conditions, we are now witnessing these large storm events which have created floods incertain regions of It is either feast or famine in California; and with the climate change impacts, we know thatwill only continue in the future.  So as we reflect on the last 5 years and we look at the progress we made last month with the WIIN Act that was part of WRDAlegislation, as time goes on, it is important that in the future, during the dry years that we will face more intensive droughtconditions, that we plan and provide for those drought conditions by creating the necessary surface storage and groundwaterstorage projects so that when we have wet years--we have wet times, as we witnessed in the last 10 days, when we see greaterrainfall amounts, increased flooding, and snow pack--that we have the water storage capabilities to meet the captured waterduring the wet years so we can use it during the dry ones. Common sense tells us that.                              {time}  1115  I urge my colleagues in Congress and the people of California to continue to work together on a bipartisan basis because itis the only way we ever get anything done.

4100,topic-id,567,"Mr.President, as I said before, we should not be holding up any of the President's nominees. There is far too much work to be done, but I think that is especially true for the man whose nomination is before us today, the next Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, who I am happy to say has my full support.  It is especially important that we confirm Price because, as we all know, our health care has undergone some serious turmoil as of late. This was undoubtedly caused, at least in part, by the rolling calamity of You can step back and you survey the wreckage, and it is sobering to see what that law has left in its wake: double-digit premium hikes, very high deductibles, and millions of canceled plans.  For all the fanfare over the law's passage, and all the arguments that followed, it seems we have forgotten the person who matters the most, the patient. That is what the next HHS Secretary is facing, a Herculean or perhaps you might say a Humpty-Dumpty-like task of picking up the pieces and rebuilding our health care system from the ground up.  So as we consider this nomination, I think it is appropriate to ask ourselves: If we need someone who will focus on the needs of patients, why not pick a doctor? Price was an orthopedic surgeon in private practice for nearly 20 years. He taught and trained young doctors personally. So when he hears the phrase ``quality, affordable, personalized care,'' it is not an abstract notion to him. It is not something he dreamed up in the Halls of Congress because he himself has provided just that kind of care to real people.  When we repeal and replace ObamaCare, we have to avoid the kind of thinking that gave rise to it. We need someone with on-the-ground understanding of what it takes to care for patients, someone who knows what it is like to stand at a bedside with a patient comforting her in a confusing and frightful moment.  Tom Price is that man. Tom Price is also my friend. We served together in the House of He is a good man. That is why, during his time in public service, he has earned the respect of his colleagues as he has worked his way up the ranks: chairman of the Republican study committee, chairman of the House Republican policy committee, and, most recently, chairman of the House Budget  He has studied our health care system from top to bottom, and he is no stranger to the health care battles the last 8 years. You could say his chief qualification for the job of replacing ObamaCare is he had the good sense to oppose it in the first place, but Tom Price did not just vote no.

4288,topic-id,2471,"Mr.President, this week the Senate will fulfill one of our most important responsibilities: advice and consent for a nominee to the Supreme The stakes don't get much higher than a lifetime appointment to a court of final appeal, especially if the court has presumed over the last two generations to take more and more political and moral questions out of the hands of the people.  President Trump has nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, a distinguished jurist who understands the critical but limited role of the Federal courts in our constitutional system. To my knowledge, no Senator genuinely disputes his eminent qualifications, his judicial temperament, and his outstanding record over the last decade on the Tenth Circuit Court of  Indeed, Judge Gorsuch would appear headed toward an easy, noncontroversial confirmation based on the comments by Democratic  The senior Senator from Colorado introduced Judge Gorsuch at his confirmation hearings with this high praise:       I have no doubt that . . . Judge Gorsuch has profound      respect for an independent judiciary and the vital role it      plays as a check on the executive and legislative branches. I      may not always agree with his rulings, but I believe Judge      Gorsuch is unquestionably committed to the rule of law.  The senior Senator from Indiana recently announced his support for Judge Gorsuch, saying:       I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his      decisions on his understanding of the law and is well      respected among his peers.  The senior Senator from West Virginia has noted:       [Judge Gorsuch] has been consistently rated as a well-     qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive,      and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man.  The junior Senator from North Dakota also praised Judge Gorsuch for his ``record as a balanced, meticulous, and well-respected jurist who understands the rule of law.''  Remember, these admiring statements all come from Democrats, and all of them support an up-or-down vote on confirming Judge  Even those who oppose Judge Gorsuch used to sing a different tune about the standards for judicial confirmation.  For instance, the senior Senator from California put it best when she said:       I think, when it comes to filibustering a Supreme Court      appointment, you really have to have something out there,      whether it's gross moral turpitude or something that comes to      the surface.  Speaking of a previous Republican President's nominee, she further said:       Now, I mean, this is a man I might disagree with. That      doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court.  In fact, President Obama filibustered a Supreme Court nomination while he was a Senator, yet later expressed regret over that decision. He said:       I think that, historically, if you look at it, regardless      of what votes particular Senators have taken, there's been a      basic consensus, a basic understanding, that the Supreme      Court is different. And each caucus may decide who's going to      vote where and what but that basically you let the vote come      up, and you make sure that a well-qualified candidate is able      to join the bench even if you don't particularly agree with      him.  Despite all of this, though, it appears that a radical Democratic minority intends to filibuster Judge Gorsuch's nomination. The minority leader is encouraging this extreme fringe, claiming, ``If Judge Gorsuch fails to earn 60 votes and fails to demonstrate he is mainstream enough to sit on the highest court, we should change the nominee, not the rules.''  I will return later to the minority leader's central and ironic role in all of this. For now, let's take a trip down memory lane so as to understand just how radical this partisan filibuster would be.  No Supreme Court nominee has ever failed because of a partisan filibuster--never, not once, ever--in the 228 years of our venerable One nominee, Justice Abe Fortas--to be elevated to Chief Justice--lost one cloture vote in 1968 on a bipartisan basis. He then withdrew under an ethical cloud, but no Supreme Court nominee has ever been defeated by a partisan filibuster.  This historical standard has nothing to do with changes in the Senate rules. The filibuster has been permitted under Senate rules since early in the 19th century. It is not a recent or a novel power. The cloture rule was adopted 100 years ago. In other words, at any point in our history, a Senate minority could have attempted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee. They had the tools. The rules permitted it. It would have only taken one Senator--just one. Yet it never happened for a simple reason: self-restraint. While written rules are important, sometimes the unwritten rules are even more so. Habits, customs, mores, standards, traditions, practices--these are the things that make the world go round, in the U.Senate no less than in the game of life. Our form of self-government depends critically on this form of self-government. Let's reconsider some recent nominees in light of these facts.  Justice Clarence Thomas was probably the most controversial nomination in my lifetime, perhaps ever. He was the subject of a vicious campaign of lies and partisan smears--a ``high-tech lynching'' in his words. He was confirmed in 1991 by a bare majority of 52-to-48. Yet Justice Thomas did not face a filibuster. Not a single Senator tried to block the up-or-down vote on his nomination--not Joe Biden, not Ted Kennedy, not Robert Byrd, not John Kerry--not one. Why? Any one Senator could have demanded a cloture vote, could have insisted on the so-called 60-vote standard and, perhaps, defeated Justice Thomas's nomination, but they did not because they respected two centuries of Senate tradition and custom.  It was likewise with Justice Sam Alito, whose nomination unquestionably shifted the Court's balance to the right in 2006. He, too, received fewer than 60 votes for confirmation--58 to be exact--but he received 72 votes for cloture. Here again, a large, bipartisan majority upheld the Senate tradition and custom against partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees. Even Judge Robert Bork, whose name is now used as a verb to mean the ``unfair partisan treatment of a judicial nominee,'' received an up-or-down vote in 1987. Yes, Judge Bork, who only received 42 votes for confirmation, did not face a partisan filibuster.  But let's not stop with Supreme Court nominations. Let's also consider other kinds of nominations so that we can understand just how radical is the Democratic minority's position.  To this day, there has never been a Cabinet nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster--never, not once, ever--in 228 years of Senate history. To this day, there has never been a trial court nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster--never, not once, ever--in 228 years of Senate history. Until 2003--just 14 years ago--there had never been an appellate court nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster.  That is just how strong the custom against filibusters was. It had never successfully happened in 214 years.[[Page S2203]]From our founding, through secession and civil war, through world wars, no matter how intense the feeling and how momentous the occasion, no matter how partisan the atmosphere, Senators always exercised self-restraint and allowed up-or-down votes on nominees for the Supreme Court, the court of appeals, the trial court, and the  But that changed in 2003, thanks in no small part to the senior Senator from New York, Chuck Schumer, now the minority leader. With the help of leftwing law professors, he convinced extremists and the Democratic caucus to filibuster President Bush's appellate court nominees. For the first time in more than two centuries of the U.Senate, a radical minority defeated nominations with a partisan filibuster.  Why did the Senate start down this path? Some point to racial politics and Miguel Estrada, who was one of the most talented appellate litigators of his generation and President Bush's nominee to the DC That court is often a proving ground for future Supreme Court nominees, and Mr.Estrada's confirmation might have enabled President Bush to nominate him, subsequently, to the Supreme A Republican President appointing the first Hispanic Justice? Surely, the Democrats couldn't allow that.  Whatever the reason, there can be no doubt that the minority leader has set in motion a chain of events over the last 14 years and has brought us to the point he claims to deplore today. So the Democrats can spare me any hand-wringing about Senate traditions and customs.  The minority leader and like-minded extremists in the Democratic caucus can also spare us their exaggerated claims of the Republican obstruction of President Obama's judicial nominees. The Democrats, after all, were the ones who broke a 214-year-old tradition specifically to obstruct 10 of President Bush's nominees. Of course, the Republicans followed suit, though I would note that they have filibustered fewer judges over more years in their having been in the minority.  Put simply, the Democrats broke one of the Senate's oldest customs in 2003 so that they could filibuster Republican judges, and they subsequently filibustered more judges than did the So it should come as no surprise that the Democrats took an even more radical step in 2013 when they used the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster for executive branch, trial court, and appellate court nominations. They broke the Senate rules by changing the Senate rules with a bare majority, not the effective two-thirds vote required under those rules.  The radical Democrats will accept no constraints on their will to power--when in power. Whatever it takes to pack the courts with liberal extremists or to block eminently qualified Republican nominees is exactly what they will do.  But don't take my word for it. Let's review what the Democrats were saying last year when they all believed they would be in power with Hillary Clinton as President and Democrats controlling the We did not hear much talk about the sacred 60-vote standard back then. On the contrary, the Democrats were promising to use the nuclear option again--this time to confirm a Democratic nominee to the Supreme  Former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said:       I have set the Senate so, when I leave, we're going to be      able to get judges done with a majority. . . . If the      Republicans try to filibuster another circuit court judge,      but especially a Supreme Court Justice, I've told `em how,      and I've done it . . . in changing the rules of the  The junior Senator from Virginia, who would have been Vice President had Secretary Clinton won, said, quite frankly, about the Supreme Court vacancy:       If these guys think they are going to stonewall the filling      of that vacancy or other vacancies, then a Democratic Senate      majority will say, ``We're not going to let you thwart the      law.''  The junior Senator from Oregon warned ominously:       If there's deep abuse, we're going to have to consider      rules changes.  The senior Senator from New Mexico perhaps summed it up best of all when he said:       The Constitution does not give me the right to block a      qualified nominee no matter who is in the White . . .      A minority in the Senate should not be able to block      qualified nominees.  Do not think for a minute that the radical Democrats would not have made good on these threats. They have exercised little restraint on judicial nominations over the last 14 years. They have betrayed over 200 years of Senate tradition and custom. They would not start respecting those traditions now.  In reality, there were good reasons to respect and uphold the old Senate tradition against the filibusters of nominees before 2003.  First, our responsibility under the Constitution is not to choose but to advise and consent. A partisan filibuster would, essentially, encroach upon the President's power to nominate the person of his choice.  Second, nominations are not susceptible to negotiation. We cannot split someone down the middle, Solomon-like. We can vote yes or no. This is not the case with legislation, where differences can be split, compromises negotiated, and bipartisan consensus reached.  Third, when legislation fails to win 60 votes, it is not the end of the world; it can go back to the drawing board or be enacted through other legislative vehicles. But when nominations are long delayed or defeated, then real work is left undone, cases go unheard, disputes go unresolved, and the law remains unclear.  It would have been better for the Senate if the minority leader and the Democrats had recognized these things in 2003 and not started us down this path, the end of which we reach this week. It is rarely a good thing when an institution ignores or breaks its customs and traditions, its unwritten rules. They should have known better, and they should have acted better. But we have come to this point because the radical Democrats didn't act any better.  Now they propose to create a new standard never known to exist before: The Senate will not confirm a Republican President's nominees to the Supreme Court, because if the Democrats will filibuster Neil Gorsuch, then they will filibuster any Republican nominee. I will never accept this double standard, and neither will my colleagues. Republicans aren't going to be played for suckers and chumps.  After this week, the Senate will be back to where it always was and where it should have remained: Nominees brought to the floor ought to receive an up-or-down, simple-majority vote. And don't expect to hear regret from me about it.  There is no moral equivalence here between the two parties. To suggest any equivalence is to divorce action from its intent and aim. In 2003 and again at this moment, the radical Democrats overturned venerable Senate traditions. The Republicans are acting to restore them. Those who cannot see the difference, to borrow from Bill Buckley, would also see no difference between a man who pushes an old lady into the path of an oncoming bus and a man who pushes the old lady out of the path of the bus, because after all, both men push around old ladies.  So I am not regretful. I am not wracked with guilt. I am not anguished. I am really not even disappointed. There are no school yard taunts of ``you did it first.'' There are no charges of hypocrisy. There is no pox on both our houses. The Republicans are prepared to use a tool the Democrats first abused in 2013 to restore a 214-year-old tradition the Democrats first broke in 2003, and we are supposed to feel guilty? The radical Democrats brought this all on themselves and on the The responsibility rests solely and squarely on their shoulders.  The minority leader is hoist with his own petard, the Senate is restored to a sensible, centuries-old tradition, and Judge Gorsuch is about to become Justice Not a bad outcome. Not bad at all. Pretty good, in fact.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

4289,topic-id,1425,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to support the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United By any objective measure, Judge Gorsuch is impeccably qualified. He is a graduate of[[Page S2204]]Columbia University and the Harvard Law School and was awarded a doctorate from He is a former law clerk for the legendary Justice Byron White, as well as for Justice He has been a respected Federal appellate judge for a decade. Judge Gorsuch has spent a lifetime in the law, and his record indicates he will make an exemplary  Just 2 weeks ago, Judge Gorsuch testified for 20 hours before the Senate Judiciary His conduct during the hearing only further confirmed what his record demonstrates: that Neil Gorsuch is a principled jurist and a good man. And I was glad for all of us to get that confirmation because Judge Gorsuch bears a heavy responsibility--he is being asked to fill the seat of Justice Antonin In truth, I doubt anyone could truly fill Justice Scalia's shoes. Justice Scalia was one of a kind, and his enormous impact on the law and on the Court will impact this Nation for generations to come.  All of us miss him dearly, but I take solace in the knowledge that one of the ways in which I believe it will be easiest for Judge Gorsuch to imitate Scalia--perhaps the most important way--is judicial humility. Justice Scalia's greatest strength was not his amazing wit, his mighty pen, or his larger-than-life personality, as much as we loved those parts of him; rather, it was his consistent unwillingness to accumulate power to himself and to the courts. He refused to impose his own personal policy preferences on the law but instead understood that his role as a judge was simply to apply the law that the elected representatives of the people had enacted.  This type of judging doesn't take otherworldly talents, although Scalia had that in abundance; instead, it takes character, integrity, and humility. Judge Gorsuch's lengthy record and his hearing testimony demonstrate that he has those attributes as well. He understands that his role as a judge is to apply the words of the Constitution and the laws of the United States to the specific cases that come before him, and nothing more. This is critical in an era when the Supreme Court has come to be seen by many--for good reason--as an activist Court, as a superlegislature that seeks to impose its own will in the place of the written law.  It is this very humility that angers so many on the left. They don't want someone who humbly applies the law; rather, they demand nothing less than a person fully committed to enacting from the Supreme Court bench whatever policies the left is championing at that given moment, because they know their only refuge is the courts because the American people would reject the policies at the voting booth. Judge Gorsuch is clearly not that kind of person, so they have committed to opposing his confirmation by whatever means necessary, legitimate or not.  Indeed, if this were being decided on qualifications and record, Judge Gorsuch would be confirmed unanimously. We don't have to hypothesize about that because Judge Gorsuch has already been confirmed by this body a decade ago by voice vote, without recorded dissent. Not a single Senator objected--not Ted Kennedy, not Hillary Clinton, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, and not even Democratic Members who still serve in this Chamber, like Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Pat Leahy, or Dick Not one of them spoke out against Gorsuch's nomination to the court of appeals--not one.  So what changed? The only thing that changed is that the radical left has become angry, extremely angry, and my Democratic colleagues are worried they will get opposed from their left in a primary. That is it. Their base demands total war, total obstruction, and they are begrudgingly bowing to this demand.  Unfortunately for them, it has proven difficult to invent attacks against an obviously well-qualified judge like Judge My Democratic colleagues couldn't get any legitimate grievance to stick at the hearings last week, despite their best efforts, but it hasn't stopped them from repeating their outlandish attacks over and over again. If the stakes weren't so high, it might even be humorous, but it isn't really funny because the primary argument the Democrats have made is dangerous. Their attack on Neil Gorsuch is a direct attack on the rule of law itself.  Contrary to the very foundations of our government and legal system, my colleagues from across the aisle are arguing that Judge Gorsuch is unqualified to be a Justice because he allegedly failed to side with the ``little guy'' over the ``big guy.'' In their view, it is now the job of judges to reject equal protection, to take the blindfold off of Lady Justice, and instead judges should put their thumbs on the scales to actively discriminate against parties based on their identity.  This notion of partisan, results-oriented judging is directly contrary to the constitutional system we have in this country. My Democratic colleagues are openly calling for judges to enforce their own political preferences from the bench, and they want to use a person's willingness or unwillingness to do so as a litmus test for who gets on the This isn't even a jurisprudential position, it is a political position. And it is difficult to imagine a more effective way to destroy our judicial system--the best in the world, despite its flaws--than to adopt this results-oriented approach.  Make no mistake, the Democrats' trumpeting of outcome-based judging will have consequences. Judges and potential judges nationwide will now have heard their siren call. You want smooth sailing in a confirmation hearing from the Democrats? Ignore the law, ignore the facts, and pick sides based upon whom you sympathize with--whoever is politically correct at that moment in time. My Democratic colleagues claim to detest attacks on the independent judiciary, but there aren't many attacks more dangerous and chilling of true independence and impartiality than the one they are making now.  The public--the people who appear in court seeking an honest tribunal--have also heard this open call for bias, for prejudice, for discrimination, and I doubt they will soon forget.  Luckily, Judge Gorsuch stood firm in his confirmation hearing. He reaffirmed what was clear from his record--that he will not legislate his own policy preferences from the bench and that he will respect the limited role a judge plays in our constitutional structure. He did all of this in the face of unrelenting opposition from my Democratic colleagues who demanded that he violate his judicial oath and swear to decide certain cases and political questions in a way that they would prefer. No recent nominee to the Supreme Court has ever made such pledges, and Judge Gorsuch rightfully refused to do so last week.  Their demands of Judge Gorsuch were particularly galling given that this was the most transparent process in history for selecting a Supreme Court During the campaign, Donald Trump promised the American people that, if elected, he would choose a Justice in the mold of Justice He laid out a specific list of 21 potential nominees, including Judge The voters were able to see precisely whom President Trump would nominate, and they were able to decide for themselves if that was the future they wanted for the Supreme  Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different kind of She promised a liberal judicial activist who would vote to undermine free speech, to undermine religious liberty, and to undermine the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.  In a very real sense, this election was a referendum on the Supreme The American people could decide for themselves between a faithful originalist vision of the Constitution or a progressive, liberal, activist vision, and the voters chose.  Donald Trump is now President Trump, and he has kept his promise to the American people, selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch from that list of 21 judges. Judge Gorsuch is no ordinary nominee. Because of this unique and transparent process, unprecedented in our Nation's history, his nomination carries with it a kind of super-legitimacy in that it has been ratified by the American people at the voting booth. Neil Gorsuch is not simply the President's nominee. It is the direction chosen by the American people, and I urge my colleagues to confirm him.  I yield the floor.

4277,topic-id,876,"Mr.President, today on Equal Pay Day, we are reminded of the fact that women across the country still make less money for the exact same work as their male counterparts, which is especially problematic for women of color, for whom the gap is even wider. We are also reminded of how vital our court system is to the future of equal opportunity for women in America and to the future of our working families.  The next Supreme Court Justice will enter the Court at a critical moment for women's rights--a moment which could change the course of reproductive rights, voting rights, disability rights, and civil liberties in our Nation for generations to come. So naturally, I, much like my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, wanted to know how these critical issues fit in Judge[[Page S2196]]Gorsuch's judicial philosophy. I have serious concerns with his record of failing to protect women's health--granting corporations and healthcare providers leeway to undermine women's access to care. I am also troubled by his rulings on disability rights that would jeopardize access to public education for students with disabilities, which is particularly alarming for the 27 million women in America who live with a disability.  It is personal for me. As an American living with disabilities, my life isn't like those of many of my colleagues in Getting around can be difficult. I can't always get into restaurants or other public spaces, even here in the I have to spend a lot of time planning how to get from one place to another.  I understand that not everyone thinks about these things, and for most of my adult life, I didn't either. But after I became injured in combat in Iraq, I learned how important the protections of laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act are to ensuring that millions of Americans with disabilities can live and thrive with dignity. Without them, Americans like me wouldn't be able to get to work, go to school, hold a job, pay taxes, go shopping, or do any of the things most of us take for granted. That is why I am speaking out today, because it matters deeply to me that our next Supreme Court Justice understand just how vital these protections are for Americans living with a disability. It is not just a disabilities rights issue; it is a civil rights issue.  Similarly, a woman's access to healthcare is also a civil rights issue, and it is an issue that affects every single When a woman can't get the care she needs, her family suffers, and when her family suffers, her community suffers and our Nation suffers. That is why I find it so deeply troubling that Judge Gorsuch has time and again actively worked against reproductive justice. In a dissenting opinion, he argued in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood in Utah based on evidence that other judges deemed as false. In the Hobby Lobby case, he made it clear that he favors the religious beliefs of corporations over the rights of women to make their own choices about their bodies.  What is worse, that isn't the only time Judge Gorsuch ruled to put corporate rights over human rights. You may have heard about a case in my home State of Illinois in which Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of the rights of a trucking company over the rights of an employee in grave danger through no fault of his own. That is deeply troubling to me. He also dissented from a ruling giving a female UPS driver just the opportunity--the opportunity--to prove sex discrimination, and then again on a decision to fine a company that failed to properly train a worker, resulting in that worker's death.  Judge Gorsuch's record makes it very clear that he is willing to elevate large corporations at the expense of everyday Americans, jeopardizing our civil rights. That is why it is so important to me that he explain his judicial philosophy, that he explain to me his view on so many of these critical issues.  But then, during 4 days of hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch had the chance to clarify the philosophy behind his past rulings--to explain how his rulings may reveal his judicial philosophy as a Supreme Court However, instead of addressing these concerns, he dodged these questions--questions on some of the most important issues of our time. He wouldn't even express clearly his views on Roe v. The American people simply deserve better than that.  Earning a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court requires much more than a genial demeanor and an ability to artfully dodge questions. It requires honesty in answering even the toughest questions. That is why I cannot vote to confirm Judge  I take seriously my constitutional responsibility as a U.Senator to offer the President my informed consent, and it is clear that Judge Gorsuch has not provided some of the most essential information needed to grant him a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Therefore, I am voting no on his nomination and supporting continued debate on the subject because I can't vote for a nominee when so many questions are left unanswered.

4078,topic-id,2961,"Mr.President, those following the proceedings of the Senate may be wondering what we are doing. Technically, we are considering the nomination of Congressman Tom Price of Georgia to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services--a position he has been nominated for by President Other Members have come to the floor and discussed other nominees, as the junior Senator from Arizona just discussed the Supreme Court nominee, but I wanted to make sure I came to the floor for a few minutes to put my thoughts on the record about the nomination of Congressman Tom Price to be Secretary of Health and Human  It almost seems like a natural fit. He is an orthopedic surgeon. This man obviously is gifted and talented and educated and skilled when it comes to the healing arts, and he made a living before his election to Congress dealing with complex surgeries. On that alone, he needs to have honest consideration from all Members of the Senate as we advise and consent to his nomination to Secretary of Health and Human But he will not be entering surgery when he goes to the Health and Human Services Department, at least not the kind of surgery experience he has had in the past; he is going to be in charge of the most important health care programs in the United States of They are programs that literally tens of millions of Americans count on; 50 or 60 million Americans count on  Medicare is that program created in the 1970s under President Lyndon Johnson that said: You don't have to reach a point in life where you are so old that you can't work anymore and therefore can't qualify for health insurance at your employment. We are going to create a program that is available for people who are 65 years of age called You are going to be able to have health insurance coverage at age 65.  It was a dramatic change in the way we looked at health care in America, and it was controversial. The medical professions opposed They argued that creating this health insurance plan for senior citizens--and later it was expanded to the disabled--meant socialized medicine, which meant that the government was going to make the decision about your health care--no longer you and your doctor; it would be the government making these critical decisions. So the American Medical Association and many others opposed the creation of  Despite that opposition, the bill went forward and passed and became law. I would go out on a limb today as a politician and say it may be the most popular single political program, perhaps only second to Social Security, in the history of the United Overnight, it changed the treatment of our parents and grandparents. There was a time--and there aren't many left who can remember it--when it reached the point where Grandma had to come and live with you because there was no place for her to go. She perhaps worked in life and perhaps hadn't. She had a limited amount of retirement. She had very modest, if any, Social She was in and out of the doctor's office and hospital. And she was in the spare bedroom. I can remember that growing up as a kid. That was considered somewhat normal at the time.  In the 1970s, that started to change. It changed, obviously, with Social Security but also with Now your grandmother had access to a doctor and a hospital, and it didn't cost her life savings. What a big change it meant. As we learned when Medicare was created, almost half of the seniors in America had no health insurance. Now that number is 1 or 2 percent.  Medicare has worked, and it has worked to give people longer lives. That is the real proof. I can brag about it all I care to, but the bottom line is that senior citizens, starting with the creation of Medicare, started living longer, more independent lives. Isn't that what every senior wants--decent, good health and independence in the way they live? Medicare has been the key to that.  It is hard to imagine that here in 2017 we are going to initiate another debate about whether America should have Fifty years later, we are going to go through this debate all over again? Apparently so, because the nominee of President Donald Trump to be the head of the Health and Human Services Department, Congressman Tom Price of Georgia, has said some troubling things about  In Politico, he said: ``Nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the Federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.'' What was he thinking? He obviously never looked at it from the perspective of someone of limited means who finally had a chance for the protection of health insurance at age 65. I met those people. One of them is a friend of mine. Her name is Judy lives in Southern I met her because she is a sweet lady who is head of hospitality at a motel where I stay in Southern She is a happy person with a big smile, and I have gotten to know her over the years. We became friends.  I came to learn one day that Judy has spent most of her life in jobs just like that. She is not a lazy person at all, but she is lucky to get part-time jobs. And when I met her at age 63, Judy told me, whispered to me once, ``Senator, I have never had health insurance in my life.'' That is a heartbreaking statement when you think about it, isn't it? This lady lived 63 years never once having health insurance. Then a couple of things happened. She asked me about the Affordable Care Act, Was it good[[Page S983]]for her or not? I told her that because her income was at a certain level, she was going to qualify for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act with no premium. She was brought into the Medicare Program at age 63. For the first time in her life, she had health insurance through the Affordable Care Act--a low-income wage earner, eligible for Medicaid at no expense to her.  And it didn't come a moment too soon. On one of my next trips down South, I saw She didn't look as healthy as she once looked. Turns out she had been diagnosed with diabetes. And at age 64, she was in need--desperate need of ongoing medical care or complications were likely to set in. It was shortly after that she qualified for So Judy has coverage. Judy has a doctor. Judy has people who care about her in her life.  That is why I wonder what Congressman Price, who wants to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, is thinking. What is he thinking about people just like her?  Let's take a look at what we have before us with his nomination. This Department touches the lives of virtually every American, Health and Human I talked about Medicare and Medicaid, but this is the Department that is responsible for medical research too--the National Institutes of Health, for example. This is the Department that oversees the Centers for Disease Control, and that is the agency which had to fight the outbreak of Ebola in West This is the Department that is in charge of promoting healthy births of babies in America and, of course, caring for our seniors I have spoken about.  On many of these issues I have just outlined, Congressman Tom Price of Georgia has made his views very clear. His legislative record and his core values as a Republican Congressman from Georgia are in contrast with the missions of the very Department President Trump has asked him to lead. Let's take a look.  New York Times said Congressman Price's views on the role of government in health care can ``be summed up in one word: Less.''  Congressman Price has spent his political career opposing many of the basic Federal health programs he is now being asked for permission to oversee. He has repeatedly voted against the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is a program that provides health insurance to 8 million kids in Even before passing the Affordable Care Act, we decided we were going to extend health insurance coverage to children, making a real commitment at the Federal level on a bipartisan basis to do it. Eight million kids are covered nationwide, 300,000 in  Congressman Price has spent the last 6 years in a desperate attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, If he were successful in that effort, it would eliminate health insurance for 30 million Americans and lead to dramatic premium increases for those with health insurance. Last year, it was Congressman Price of Georgia who authored the repeal and retreat reconciliation bill that, thank goodness, was vetoed by President Bound and determined Congressman Price was to eliminate And for 6 years, Republicans have never had a replacement. That is why they are changing their rhetoric. It went from repeal, to repeal and replace, and now it is repair. I can't keep up with them. But I will tell you, starting with repeal is inviting a disaster in health care in America and calling into question the health insurance coverage of 30 million people in our country. So if Congressman Price had his way, it would mean less funding, fewer services, and fewer people covered.  In addition to wanting to repeal our health care law, Congressman Price wants to fundamentally and negatively change Medicare and Those two programs together serve about one-third of the people living in America, 120 million. He wants to eliminate the Affordable Care Act's expansion of  Remember Judy? Her income was too low. She couldn't pay any health insurance premiums. But because her income was so low, she qualified to be brought into the rolls of Medicaid in Over 600,000 people just like her were brought into protection of health insurance for the first time in their lives. This is one of our best tools for primary care for people who are in low-income situations-- Because we included in the Affordable Care Act a guarantee that health insurance would cover mental illness and substance abuse treatment, in some parts of my State where opioid addiction and heroin deaths are so prevalent, people with health insurance have access to substance abuse treatment. Congressman Price, who would repeal ObamaCare, would eliminate that guarantee in health insurance.  Repealing the Medicaid expansion that I mentioned earlier would put 650,000 Illinoisans out of insurance, and our State would lose $37 billion in Federal funding over the next decade.  What impact does it have if a person shows up at an emergency room sick, with no insurance? In America, that person still receives care, but who pays for it? Everybody else. People with health insurance end up paying for those who receive care and don't pay for it. Medicaid makes sure that hospital receives a payment. So when Congressman Price wants to eliminate the coverage of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, it means less money coming into the hospitals across Some hospitals are big and prosperous, and they can take it; others cannot. In downstate Illinois, where I hail from, smalltown America, hospitals in those communities losing Medicaid, which Congressman Price would eliminate, are going to have a tough time staying open.  The Illinois Hospital Association tells us we will lose 90,000 jobs if Congressman Price's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act goes forward--90,000 in I need not tell you they are the best paying jobs in downstate communities. So it is a job-killer, and sadly it endangers the health of the people who count on these hospitals.  What is he thinking? He is a doctor. He should be thinking in terms of what it means when you don't protect people with basic health insurance. Right now, if you qualify for Medicaid, you are guaranteed to get health care. Under Congressman Price's plan--the man who wants to be head of Health and Human Services--the guarantee is gone. Illinois would have lost $14 billion in Medicaid funding if Congressman Price had his way.  Faced with far less Federal funding, the States would have to be forced to find ways to save money, even worse than what we currently have in our They might start Medicaid waiting lists or work requirements or cut benefits. Think about it. A person nominated to lead the Nation's premier health agency supports proposals that would take health care away from people.  It gets worse. Congressman Price wants to privatize Be careful when you hear a politician stand up and say: I want to guarantee your access to health insurance. Well, I have access to a lot of things. I can walk onto the showroom floor of people who are selling $85,000, $95,000 cars. I mean, I have access to those showrooms. Can I buy one of them? I can't afford it. Most people couldn't. But I have access to it. So when they say you have access to health insurance, the obvious next question is, What kind of health insurance? And how am I going to pay for it? Watch out for that word ``access.'' It is a loaded political word.  Just the other night my colleague Bernie Sanders was debating Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and darned if Senator Cruz didn't come up with that word, saying we have to make sure every American has access to health insurance. No, we have to make sure every American has health insurance. How about that? Health insurance they can afford that is worth buying.  Congressman Price wants to privatize So instead of having a government-run program for tens of millions of Americans, he wants to put seniors and the disabled in America back in the loving arms of health insurance companies. How about that? Do you remember a time when you or your family was on the phone with somebody, begging them for health insurance coverage, waiting and waiting and waiting for your turn? That is what he thinks is access, and that is what he believes is good health insurance. I don't. Ending the guarantee of Medicare for hardworking American seniors and handing them a voucher[[Page S984]]and wishing them good luck on finding their own insurance--that may be access, but it is not protection.  The point of voucherizing Medicare is to save the government money by forcing seniors to pay more out of their own pockets. That is Congressman Price's approach, and now he wants to head up the agency in charge of Don't take my word for it. He said: ``Nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''  Since 1965, when we created Medicare, listen to what has happened. Before Medicare, 51 percent of Americans 65 or older had health care coverage and nearly 30 percent lived in poverty. That is before 1965. Today, 98 percent of seniors have health care coverage, primarily because of Fewer than 10 percent live below the poverty line. It has made a dramatic difference in their quality of life, the length of their lives, and the independence they enjoy in their lives.  In addition, by ensuring access to care for more people, Medicare has contributed to life expectancy--5 years higher today than it was in 1965. So Medicare has helped ensure more seniors have health insurance, fewer seniors are living in poverty, and people are living longer. Is that what Congressman Price considers a ``negative effect on the delivery of health care''?  There are so many different issues where Congressman Price has taken what I consider to be radical and extreme views, particularly when it comes to health care. I won't go through the long list, but I will say this. We debated the future of Medicare when I was a member of the Simpson-Bowles We were looking at the deficit situation facing our country and looking, as we should, at entitlements. Many of us said at the time: Be careful about raising the eligibility age for For a Congressman or a Senator, a couple more years at a desk before you qualify for Medicare is not a big ask. But if you happen to be a waitress on her feet every day, suffering from arthritis or some other issues, 2 more years in the workplace literally are backbreakers. If you happen to be driving a truck, making deliveries, changing the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 or 70 is where you are going to get in trouble. That is where people actually are going to face a hardship.  Sadly, Congressman Tom Price of Georgia doesn't get it. He doesn't understand that part of it. Because he doesn't, I am going to be opposing his nomination and watching carefully and closely.  There is going to be a battle royal on the floor of the House and the Senate about funding important programs in The Department of Defense, as important as it is for America's security, wants all the money it can get its hands on, and I want to make sure we always spend enough to keep us safe. But the battle is going to be between defense and nondefense. Nondefense includes health care. Nondefense includes medical research. Nondefense includes education.  Now we are going to have someone here at the Department of Health and Human Services who, sadly, is not committed to the basics of Medicare and That is not good news for seniors and disabled people across the That is why I am going to oppose Congressman  I yield the floor.

That is why I decided not to stand on the aisle in the House Chamber to shake the President's hand during the joint session of Congress, as I have done in the past through Democratic and Republican administrations alike. This will be the first time during my 29 years in this House I have made this decision.  I have deep respect for the Presidency, and I will attend the joint session, but that respect between the branches must be mutual. The President has attacked the free press by calling it the enemy of the people. He has rejected America's traditional role welcoming refugees who have helped to make our country great. He has cozied up to Vladimir Putin, the strongman who attacks our democracy. He has moved to gut the Affordable Care He has looked the other way when threats against the Jewish community have increased in the recent year.  This isn't part of our normal political discourse. This goes beyond ideological and political differences. The President needs to work with all people. Therefore, I will listen to what he has to say today, but I will not greet him and shake his hand.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1363-3.txt,344,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,28.0,February

4077,topic-id,1044,"Mr.President, as I did last week, I rise again to support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme As we know, he is an accomplished, mainstream jurist, and he is a worthy successor to Justice Antonin I look forward to seeing him receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. I truly hope that happens.  After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and learning more about his judicial philosophy, I continue to be impressed by his humble respect for the law and his commitment to service. Before the hearings in the Judiciary Committee, I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight one aspect of his jurisprudence that I find particularly important: the separation of powers.  To hear some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, Judge Gorsuch represents two equal yet opposing dangers to the country. First, they warn that he will lack any independence of thought or commitment to the They allege that he would serve merely as a rubberstamp for President Trump and his agenda.  In the same breath, though, they claim he would engage in unprecedented judicial oversight of the Federal executive agencies. In other words, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle assert that Judge Gorsuch would be both too deferential to Federal agencies and not deferential enough.  The truth is, these warnings and accusations are entirely unfounded, and they appear to be grounded more in political calculations than in honest concern. For my part, I am excited about the prospect of confirming a Justice who not only represents the separation of powers but reveres it as one of the central principles of the  A commitment to our constitutional separation of powers could not come at a more crucial time, as executive branch agencies have increasingly accumulated power and autonomy over the years. Both the Congress and the Federal judiciary bear responsibility for this.  Legislatively, Congress simply cedes too much of its own lawmaking power to the executive branch. We have been doing that for years. These agencies have been legislating through Federal regulation. In turn, Congress has allowed unelected bureaucrats to create law and determine how that law should be implemented.  We have to stop this erosion of our article I power. Congress needs to take ownership of its lawmaking authority and reverse this dangerous trend toward governance by executive fiat. That is only part of the equation. The Federal judiciary needs to use its constitutional prerogative to rein in the executive branch.  Ever since the 1980s, Federal courts have grown far too deferential to executive agencies. Under a doctrine known as Chevron deference, the courts defer to agency decisions if it makes ``reasonable'' regulations based on ``vague'' statutes.  In fact, this means that when the Federal courts consider an agency decision, the judges have a new catchphrase: ``The agency is always right.'' This should concern my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who voiced strong concerns about rubberstamping.  I don't think the Founders ever intended for two constitutional branches of our Federal Government to voluntarily cede the power to the third. Importantly, neither does Judge Judge Gorsuch has written extensively both about delegation and deference in his role as judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of  He addressed the issue of delegation in a recent case called Caring Hearts Personal Home Services, v. In it, he noted:       Executive agencies today are permitted not only to enforce      legislation, but to revise[[Page S982]]     and reshape it through exercise of so-called ``delegated''      legislative authority.  He continued:       The number of formal rules these agencies have issued,      thanks to their delegated legislative authority, has grown so      exuberantly, it's hard to keep up. The Code of Federal      Regulations now clocks in at over 175,000 pages.  He noted that delegation presents both separation of powers problems and due process problems. The reason is simple. The executive is doing the work of the legislature.  In terms of due process, Judge Gorsuch wondered ``whether and how people can be fairly expected to keep pace with and conform their conduct to all this churning and changing `law.' ''  He further questioned: ``What happens if we reach the point where even these legitimate legislating agencies don't know what their own `law' is?''  Judge Gorsuch could not be more correct. With tens of thousands of pages published in the Federal Register every year, it is fair to wonder how any agency can be certain of the legal effect of its own rules. If the agencies that write these laws can't keep track of them, how can a small business owner in Arizona be expected to comply with the litany of ever-changing rules written by unelected bureaucrats?  Judge Gorsuch has also discussed the problem of deference and explained the proper relationship between Federal agencies and the judiciary. In his concurring opinion, in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, Judge Gorsuch explained:       In enlightenment theory and hard won experience under a      tyrannical king, the founders found proof of the wisdom of a      government of separated powers.  He continued:       The founders considered the separation of powers a vital      guard against governmental encroachment on the people's      liberties, including all those later enumerated in the Bill      of  Judge Gorsuch found Chevron deference inconsistent with this constitutional framework, which he called ``no less than a judge-made doctrine for the abdication of the judicial duty.''  He concluded:       We managed to live with the administrative state before      We could do it again. Put simply, it seems to me      that in a world without Chevron, very little would change--     except perhaps the most important things.  The separation of powers is the most important feature of our constitutional system of government. When each branch of government serves as a check on the other, it fosters a more deliberative, judicious, and limited form of governance. As someone who embraces limited government, it is a privilege to support and confirm a judge like Neil Gorsuch who supports this philosophy.  As I have said before, and I will say again, Judge Gorsuch deserves fair consideration by those who serve in this body, and he deserves an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. When he receives that vote, he will be confirmed overwhelmingly.  I yield back the remainder of my time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan).

The most remarkable proposal came from the President recently in his budget proposals.                              {time}  1815  I know that when I saw what he was proposing, I am thinking: You have got to be kidding. He is proposing a $5.6 billion reduction in the National Institutes of Health's research programs.[[Page H2506]]  I want to just take a second here and draw your attention to what research really means.  The National Institutes of Health is the principal research arm for healthcare issues throughout the United Over the years, we have spent very large amounts of taxpayer dollars dealing with health issues in the United The result of those research efforts, together with the implementation, has resulted in breast cancer deaths dropping, between 2000 and 2013, by 2 percent, prostate cancer deaths down 11 percent, heart disease down 14 percent, stroke down 23 percent, HIV/AIDS down 52 percent.  Research pays in better lives, in people living longer and the quality of their life. And yet this 18 percent reduction that has been proposed by the President in the basic funding for medical research here in the United States goes directly against these very important and very impressive changes in the statistics about mortality--HIV/AIDS, 52 percent.  Now, it is not all research, but it begins with research. It is unconscionable that such a proposal would be brought to the House of  We are going to go beyond these success stories, and we are going to talk about this purple line here. The deaths from Alzheimer's have actually increased by 71 percent in the same 13-year period, in part due to the fact that the population, the baby boomers and those that preceded them, grow old; and that is where Alzheimer's occurs, in the older age groups.  So what is the research funding here on Alzheimer's? Well, not so good.  But before I go to that, I just want to take one moment and draw your attention to this little chart. This is the funding level for the National Institutes of Health's projected budget: $31.7 billion. The scientists, the researchers out there said that that is underfunding not from their wish list, but from viable, credible research programs that can't be paid for because they have run out of money. So they have suggested that the budget should be somewhere around $35 billion.  So what does the President propose? Well, he proposes, instead of going up, going down to $25 billion or just close to $26 billion, $5.6 billion less.  The result is that this is not going to come down. We are going to talk about this for the next hour, about research, about the National Institutes of Health, about what it means to your life, to my life, to my colleagues' lives, to be able to extend our lives, whether it might be prostate cancer, heart disease, stroke, HIV, or Alzheimer's. It is a fact that, if we are to increase the research in this area, which, until just last year, was just over $500 million, we can see this begin to change.

4212,topic-id,718,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Raskin so very much. And, indeed, the National Institutes of Health has a stellar representative, as do the American people, and certainly the people of  As he told his own personal story of one of the dreaded diseases, I am delighted to see him stand here in such good health. Apparently, he has recovered completely from that.  I suspect that recovery was, at least in part, due to, first, his good health at the outset, but also to the research that was done in the preceding years through the National Institutes of Health on cancer research. We have seen the decline in cancer deaths as a result of that research. What we would like to do is to deal with this Alzheimer's.  I want to take a moment just to talk about where we are. We had a huge debate last week on repealing the Affordable Care Act and what it would mean to Americans, and a lot of that debate centered around the cost of medical services. Tragically, one of the ways that the proponents of repealing the Affordable Care Act would save money is to reduce the Medicaid program in different ways, but the end result was to reduce the Medicaid program.  Sixty percent of the Medicaid program is for people in long-term care facilities. A good percentage of those, probably the majority of those, with some sort of dementia or Alzheimer's. What we need to do is to address this issue straightforward.  I will tell my own story.  My mother-in-law lived the last 3 years of her life in our home. We were in a position where we were able to take care of her, so she didn't go to a long-term care facility. Nonetheless, it was one of the obligations that we felt we had, and many, many other Americans share that obligation.  This is 2015. The number $2.026 billion came up during the discussion that we had. That is what we spent in 2016. Some of that was spent by other payors. That would be insurance companies. Some was spent by family. Medicare and Medicaid spent the great majority.  As we go through the years, in 2020, we expect to spend $267 billion. And again, Medicare and Medicaid make up the great majority of it. As we move through time, we will see that there will be greater and greater expenses, rising year by year, so that in the year 2050, which is not that far away--that is one generation away--we will be spending over $1 trillion, and Medicare and Medicaid will, throughout this entire period, be the single largest source of money to pay for Alzheimer's.  So, if we want to reduce the cost of premiums, if we want to reduce the cost of government, if we want to deal[[Page H2510]]with the quality of life of Americans, then we have to get to this research because there is hope. Alzheimer's is not a hopeless disease. It is not a disease for which there is no cure. It is a disease for which we have not spent money on finding the cure.  If we can delay by a year, we will save tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money in care that has been pushed off into the future. And the quality of life for the individual that has one more year of quality of life ahead of them is enormous and invaluable.  Here is just a way of depicting the backward nature of how we are dealing with the research for Alzheimer's. This was originally the 2015. We have been at this a couple of years, and we have seen progress.  In 2016, we spent $941 million, just under $1 billion, on Alzheimer's research. At the same time, we spent $153 billion in the care of Alzheimer's in Medicare and It is Federal taxpayer money.  Look, $1 billion, less than $1 billion in research, $153 billion in out-of-pocket expense caring for these individuals that have come down with Alzheimer's. A pretty neat equation here, isn't it?  If we were to ramp that up, as we would like to see, from $941 million to $1.4 billion, the researchers all across this country--some in San Diego, as we heard from Mr.Scott Peters; others in New Jersey, as we heard from ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2505-6.txt,1973,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,28.0,January

Because of the fairness of the hearings, because of the fairness with which Chairman Grassley executed the hearings, it is quite obvious that this Chamber is faced with a very exceptional judge, a very exceptional nominee, and a nominee there is really no excuse to vote against.  Neil Gorsuch really is about the story of the He is a fourth-generation It is nice to stand here and talk about somebody who shares so much of our western experience and western heritage and somebody who serves on the Tenth Circuit Court in Denver--a circuit court that represents 20 percent of the land mass of the United  Neil Gorsuch's background and upbringing in Colorado represent the hard work of westerners. His maternal grandfather, Joseph McGill, began his adult life by working in Union Station, the main railway terminal in downtown McGill put himself through medical school and went on to become a prominent surgeon. His grandmother, Dorothy Jean, raised seven children, all of whom he gave a better life and put through college because of his work in  Neil's paternal grandfather, John Gorsuch, was his legal inspiration. After serving in World War I, John Gorsuch put himself through undergrad and law school at the University of Denver by driving a trolley car back in the trolley car days of John, his grandfather, helped to build a private law practice that focused on real estate law. He made time to help Denver's welfare department and participated in Kiwanis and numerous other civic organizations, building a legendary law firm in Denver known as Gorsuch  This is the kind of upbringing that made Neil Gorsuch who he is. In his younger days, Neil moved furniture, shoveled snow, like so many of us in Colorado, mowed lawns. It was the kind of upbringing that brings grit and determination to any person who knows hard work. It is that work ethic, combined with his family's appreciation of higher education, that helped Neil consistently realize academic excellence. It has been debated on this floor numerous times, his academic credentials that he would bring to the Supreme Court--his background and education at Columbia, law school at Harvard, his Ph.at Oxford, and of course, most importantly, the summer he spent at the University of Colorado and the teaching he carries out at the University of Colorado School of  This week, we are going to see a lot of finger-pointing and hear a lot of accusations. We are going to hear a lot of blame. The one thing we may not hear too much about is the person we are debating--Neil That is because when it comes to Judge Gorsuch, people understand the highly qualified judge that he is. People understand the incredible legal mind he would bring to the Supreme Instead of debating the merits of the nominee, they are going to debate how we got to the place we are today, and by the end of this week, architects of obstruction may force this Chamber to vote along partisan lines on something that should be a bipartisan effort.  In Colorado, if you go to downtown Denver, you will see an area known as Confluence Confluence Park is a great place in Colorado where people go to spend an afternoon and perhaps a weekend on a hot summer's day. It is where two rivers join together. There at Confluence Park, Colorado's poet laureate, Thomas Hornsby Ferril, has a poem inscribed on a plaque, which reads:       I wasn't here. Yet I remember them, the first night long      ago, those wagon people who pushed aside enough of the      cottonwoods to build our city where the blueness rested.  It is a poem that reminds us in Colorado that we are always looking up, that we are always looking toward the mountains and to that great blue sky. That is what Neil Gorsuch has done his entire life. He is somebody who is forward-thinking, somebody who understands the optimistic sense of Colorado, who understands the majesty of our West, and who understands the majesty of our form of government--a system that has three separate but equal branches of power. He has led a life that is dedicated to the majesty of our He is somebody who understands the pillars of our government in that no one branch of government should gain an unfair advantage over the other. That is what we ought to be debating this week. Instead, we are going to live the consequences of decisions that were made over a decade ago.  It is interesting that Judge Gorsuch serves on the Tenth Circuit Court because one of his fellow judges on the Tenth Circuit Court was nominated by President George Bush in the early part of 2001, 2002, 2003. It was Tim Tymkovich who was nominated by President Bush and who was caught up in the very first round of filibusters that changed the way this Chamber worked on nominations.  It was a calculated determination by some in this Chamber to use a tool that had never been used before in such a lethal, partisan fashion that it would bring down judges and ultimately lead to a corrosion of Senate custom--a corrosion of over 200 years of Senate practice--when it comes to judges' confirmations. Ultimately, this week, we will see whether it leads to the disruption of how we confirm Supreme Court  Make no mistake about it, over the past 200 years, we have not seen this moment before--a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court People are going to talk about this around the country as they read the news, as they listen to the radio, as they watch on TV what is happening in the Most will just wonder, is the nominee qualified? If the nominee is qualified, then why are we trying to have an argument about ``he said, she said'' 15 years ago, 16 years ago? Because the nominee is well qualified, he should be confirmed. Why are we going to change 200 years of Senate practice and custom if the nominee is highly qualified, has what it takes to serve on the Supreme Court? That is the choice Members of this Chamber will have to make over the next several days as we work to confirm Judge  In 2006 when Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to serve on the Tenth Circuit[[Page S2193]]Court in Denver, this Chamber did so unanimously by voice vote. There are a dozen Members in this Chamber who served then and did not oppose his nomination, many of whom seem willing today to block his nomination to the Supreme  One thing has changed in the intervening years; that is, who serves in the Presidency, who serves in the White House, who serves as President, and whether that nomination came from a Republican or a The nomination, of course, in 2006 came from a Still, he was confirmed unanimously. Judge Gorsuch, now nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, was appointed by a Yet those very same people who supported him 11 years ago are now objecting to his service on the High Court after his exemplary decade of service on the Tenth Circuit  It was service that showed Judge Gorsuch's joining in over 2,700 opinions, and with the majority the vast number of times. It was service in which he got to know the Colorado legal community. As we have discussed over the past several days and several weeks and the past month, the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best are the people who served with him and who worked with him at the Department of Justice, who practiced law with him, and who serve in the Colorado legal community. I thought it was important that we spend some time in talking about the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best because I think their opinions matter in this--those of the people of Colorado who want Judge Gorsuch confirmed.  Let me start with a series of quotes from Judge Gorsuch's supporters back home in Colorado--again, those people who know him the best.  This particular quote comes not from a Republican, not from a conservative; this quote comes from Steve Farber, who served in 2008 as the Democratic National Convention cochair. Again, he is not a conservative and he is not a Republican; he was the cochair of the 2008 Democratic National       We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of utmost character.      He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a judge and a person.  Steve Farber continues:       We all agree that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well      qualified to join the Supreme He deserves an up-or-     down vote.  This is not Mitch McConnell who is saying this. It is not Cory Gardner, Republican Senator from Colorado, who is saying this. This is a very prominent figure in Colorado's legal community and somebody who served in the 2008 Democratic National  One of those 12 people who supported Judge Gorsuch in 2006 was then-Senator Barack Obama, who was seeking the nomination at Mile High Stadium, at this very convention of which Steve Farber was cochair. Steve Farber says we should confirm Judge Gorsuch with an up-or-down vote.  Norm Brownstein said that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair shake in the confirmation process. He is another very prominent Democratic lawyer in  We have heard a lot of people talk about the cases--those 2,700 opinions--that he was a part of. We have heard Senator Grassley talk about arguments against Judge Gorsuch, people who have said that Judge Gorsuch was always against the little guy and that he was siding with corporations.  Here is a quote from a Denver lawyer and Democrat on representing underdogs before Judge Gorsuch:       [Judge Gorsuch] issued a decision that, most certainly,      focused on the little guy.  Why did Marcy Glenn say this? Marcy Glenn said this because she knows that Judge Gorsuch voted with the majority of the court in 99 percent of the cases. In those 2,700 opinions, 99 percent of the time, Judge Gorsuch ruled with the majority. That is not trying to look out for the big guy or the little guy. That is about following the law. That is about a court that recognizes it is not in the business of focus groups or policy preferences, popularity contests or poll testing. It is about a judge who recognizes that the rule of law matters and that you take an opinion where the law leads you and takes you, not where your personal opinion takes you. It was 99 percent of the time that Judge Gorsuch voted to side with the majority on the court, and 97 percent of the time, those rulings were unanimous. Those decisions were unanimous. Of those 99 percent in which he sided with the majority, 97 percent of them were unanimously decided.  This is a judge who is as mainstream as we have seen. He is somebody who understands the obligation and the duty he has to the law. He is somebody who understands what it means to be a good judge.  I want to read a letter Senator Bennet and I received from the Colorado legal community:       As members of the Colorado legal community, we are proud to      support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next      Supreme Court We hold a diverse set of political      views as Republicans, Democrats, and  That is bipartisan support back home from those people who know the judge the best.  What does Neil Gorsuch think it takes to be a good and faithful judge? I will just read from Judge Gorsuch:       It seems to me that the separation of legislative and      judicial powers isn't just a formality dictated by the      Neither is it just about ensuring that two      institutions, with basically identical functions, are      balanced one against the other. To the Founders, the      legislative and judicial powers were distinct by nature, and      their separation was among the most important liberty-     protecting devices of the constitutional design--an      independent right of people essential to the preservation of      all of the rights later enumerated in the Constitution and      its amendments.       Now, consider, if we allow the judge to act like a      legislator, unconstrained by the bicameralism and presentment      hurdles of Article I, the judge would need only his own voice      or those of just a few colleagues to revise the law, willy-     nilly, in accordance with his preferences, and the task of      legislating would become a relatively simple thing.       Notice too how hard it would be to revise this so easily      made judicial legislation to account for changes in the world      or to fix mistakes. Being unable to throw judges out of      office in regular elections, you would have to wait for them      to die before you would have any chance of change. Even then,      you would find the change difficult, for courts cannot so      easily undo the errors given the weight that they afford to      precedent.       Notice, finally, how little voice the people would be left      in a government in which life-appointed judges are free to      legislate alongside elected representatives. The very idea of      self-government would seem to wither to the point of      pointlessness. Indeed, it seems that, for reasons just like      these, Hamilton explained, that liberty can have nothing to      fear from the judiciary alone but that it has everything to      fear from the union of the judicial and legislative powers.  That is what Judge Gorsuch said makes a good and faithful judge.  Over the course of the next week or over the course of the next several days, we are going to flesh out in detail some of the decisions people may find they disagree with. We will flesh out in detail Judge Gorsuch's temperament and his performance at the committee hearings. Yet there is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the support of the American people, who believe he should be confirmed. There is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the support of people who cochaired the Democratic National Convention and of prominent attorneys who know him best from There is no doubt that his is an upbringing from the It is the story of how we built the  I hope that over the course of the next few days, Republicans and Democrats alike will come to the conclusion that we will do this country a service. Instead of having partisan fights, we will have the bipartisanship support for a judge who will truly make this country proud, a judge who will truly represent the law, not personal opinion.  I thank the Presiding Officer for this opportunity today. I look forward to being here for the rest of the week as we talk about Judge Gorsuch's qualifications and as we talk about the nomination.  More than anything, let's make it clear that for 200-plus years, we have allowed judges to come to this floor for the Supreme Court and to be confirmed by a simple majority--no threshold, no 60-vote requirement. We have done so without partisan filibusters. I think that if we can maintain that custom, that practice, this country will be better served. There is no reason to change two centuries of practice in this body simply because they have decided they do not like the person who made the nomination.  I yield the floor.

4163,topic-id,1665,"Mr.Speaker, it has been an interesting couple of days. We heard from our President, and that was a great privilege this morning to hear from him at our We were reminded what an amazing victory President Trump had last Some said it was so very historic, maybe as historic going back clear to Andrew Jackson's victory in 1828.  That took me back, being a lover of history, being convinced over the years, as I majored in history in college because I knew out of the Army 4 years, when I finished that, I figured I would major in what I loved, and that was history. Although my mother thought I should have majored in math or either been a doctor or a college math professor.  But history I loved, and I continue to learn from history. The old adage is those who refuse to learn from history are destined to repeat it. The corollary that is not as well known is those who[[Page H2279]]do learn from history will find new ways to screw up.  But the 1828 election that saw Andrew Jackson become our President actually happened after four abysmal years, some would say the least productive 4 years any President has ever had, and it was actually a President who was a hero of mine, John Quincy He was the first son of a former President to be Some have said he was probably the best educated President we have ever had, having been educated at the best Massachusetts had, England had, and France had. He wrote books in German, fluently spoke  Of course, if he had had his way, he would have been married to an American, but when his mother, Abigail, was not too pleased with the girl he thought was the love of his life, he ended up being directed to England where he ended up falling in love with Louisa, and she ultimately became his wife; but apparently his mother didn't think she was quite fit. Louisa became the first--used to be able to say the only--First Lady the country has ever had who was not born in the United Like I say, if he had had his choice--first choice--then his wife would have been born in the United But that is the way things fall. He loved his wife dearly.  He was quite accomplished. He kept the most complete journal of anybody we have ever had who was He knew slavery was wrong. He knew slavery was destroying our country, that we could never reach the potential that God had for this country unless we eliminated slavery. He had corresponded to England with a guy by the name of William Wilberforce, who had dedicated his adult life since his twenties to eliminating slavery in the British Isles and British territories.                              {time}  1715  He ran for President in 1824. No one won with the electoral votes. It was thrown to the House of John Quincy Adams garnered the favor of Henry Clay in the And when Clay threw his support behind John Quincy Adams, Adams then won the  Adams had some friends who were very close to him. They knew his heart, they knew his heart was pure, and his intentions were clearly nothing but the very best for the United They knew him to be a man of honor, a man of integrity, a man of his word. He had not made any kind of deal with Henry Clay to make him Secretary of But as a man of honor, a man of integrity, he could not understand why he couldn't go ahead, and why he shouldn't go ahead, and appoint Henry Clay to be Secretary of  His closest friend said: John, if you appoint Henry Clay to be Secretary of State, you will never, ever be able to convince anybody in Congress--the House or Senate--you will never convince anybody in Washington but your closest friends, those of us that really love you, you will never convince the rest of the world or posterity that you had not cut a deal with Henry Clay that in return for his support for you being President, you would make him Secretary of Please, appoint him to anything, but not Secretary of It is going to look like you made a deal and bought the Presidency with the appointment.  But there were those who did not love John Quincy Adams, didn't have that much respect for him, and would have been fine if he had not won the election, but he had won the election. And those who didn't care about John Quincy Adams encouraged him: Sure, appoint Henry Clay, it is your choice. You appoint whoever you want.  Those who loved John said: John, it is not a good idea. People are going to brand you improperly. We know you are honest. Those are not really your friends that are telling you to just appoint Henry Clay to be Secretary of Go ahead.  He didn't listen to the closest friends who loved him and cared about him. He listened to those who didn't care if he succeeded or failed. So he appointed Henry Clay to be Secretary of  Some historians would say he had the least productive 4 years of any President in history. It is always arguable. But there were clearly times throughout his 4 years as President when he backed bills and pushed bills that would have been good for the United States and that should have had the support of both the House and Senate when they couldn't get passed simply because people thought he had bought the office with the appointment of Henry Clay to Secretary of And so they went against anything and everything that John Quincy Adams tried to support thereafter.  That may seem kind of a strange story to pull out from history, except I was reminded of it as I thought about today, and I thought about some folks who even in October, they didn't care about Donald Trump getting elected President, they didn't really support him at that point, so they encouraged him: You go ahead and let's do this bill that we are bringing to the floor and just never mind the fact that prices will not come down, unless you want to say 10 percent over 3 years, maybe 10 percent.  After the prices will probably continue to go up after those same 3 years, we may be able to cut 10 percent off at some point. Why? Because we are not stripping the regulation, the regulatory authority, out of We are only repealing part of it. And we are leaving almost all of the part that has driven costs through the roof. It has driven the price of health insurance through the roof. It has blown the deductibles so high that so many of my constituents and friends know they will never have enough cash to pay for the deductible to even get to a claim that the insurance company would pay.  And I just know that when the prices of health insurance don't come down over the next few years, people are going to say President Trump broke his promise to repeal He only got part of it, but the monopolies that had begun to grow in the health insurance market grew bigger and fatter. And a man who wanted to do an honorable thing for America and get rid of ObamaCare--that it cost people their insurance, their doctor, their medicine, that it caused so much suffering and heartache as people struggle with their healthcare bills--he promised he would get rid of it, he wanted to deliver on his promise, and he has been told by people who weren't really sure if they cared if he won or lost that: Gee, just pass this, this will be great. Just pass anything. Pass something. We will call it a victory and move on.  But these are the times when it is very important to take an assessment of those who want to see you succeed and those who really don't care. There are those who have felt on the Republican side that if Donald Trump was defeated, that would be the end of the Tea Party movement, that would be the end of any type of populism rising up against the runaway socialism, the runaway assault on religious freedom, the Second  The American public rose up, and this is our first chance to really deliver on our promises. I hope that the votes are not all there yet so that we can reach an agreement so that we can include in the bill that comes to the floor, not an amendment we vote on so that it can be voted down, but actually included in the bill so that we take out at least the big hunk of what has caused health insurance prices to skyrocket.  And if we can do that, we can have a win this week, one that we can all feel good about on our side of the aisle, and even my friends on the other side of the aisle. If we do the right thing and make sure that we take action that actually legitimately brings down health insurance costs, then my friends on the other side of the aisle will hear good reports of joyful remarks with gratitude that insurance prices have come down, we can now afford it, our deductible is lower, we are building a health savings account, it is great.  There are some good things that can come out of the votes this week. But if people take advice from those who are not as concerned with their total success, then this could be the start of a Presidency that was as unpleasant as John Quincy Adams' Presidency, which ended up leading to the inevitable result of his defeat in 1828 to Andrew  I hope we keep our promise.

4110,topic-id,310,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute to fellow Iowan Judge Edward ``Nick''  Judge McManus died earlier this month at the age of 97.  He has a long and deep history in Iowa politics and judicial activities.  When I first entered the State legislature, Judge McManus was known as Lieutenant Governor He also served in the Iowa  In 1962, President John Kennedy appointed him chief judge of the Northern District of Iowa where he served for 23 years when he took senior status. His ascension to this position made him the first native-born Iowan appointed to the Federal Northern District Court of He remained on the bench for a total of 55 years and was still taking cases at the time of his death.  He was proud of his service on the court and the modernization of the court he started in 1962.  Upon Judge McManus's death, current acting U.Attorney Sean Berry told the Cedar Rapids Gazette, ``The changes implemented by Judge McManus left an indelible and positive impact on the efficient administration of justice for all litigants in the federal court.''  He took great pride that the only time he had a backlog of cases was the first 100 that were there when he took the job. He took very seriously the Bill of Rights Sixth Amendment where it says ``the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.''  His longtime assistant, Deb Frank, may have said it best, ``I know he loved to work. He loved what he was doing. I think it's just the whole idea of coming to the office every day and doing what needed to be done.''  Barbara and I send our sincerest condolences to Judge McManus's five sons, two step-sons, other family members, and friends.

4274,topic-id,2374,"Mr.President, today we will continue to debate the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United  The Judiciary Committee held four full days of hearings last month. The judge testified for more than 20 hours. He answered more than 1,000 questions during his testimony and hundreds more questions for the record. We have had the opportunity to review the 2,700 cases he has heard, and we have had the opportunity to review the more than 180,000 pages of documents produced by the Bush Library and the Department of Now, after all of this, my Democratic colleagues unfortunately appear to remain committed to what they have been talking about for a long period of time: filibustering the nomination of this very well qualified jurist.  Even after all of this process, there is no attack against the judge that sticks. In fact, it has been clear since before the judge was nominated that some Members in the Democratic leadership would search desperately for a reason to oppose him.  As the minority leader said before the nomination: ``It's hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support.'' That is the end of the quote from the minority leader.  He said later, and I will continue to quote him: ``If the nominee is out of the mainstream, we'll do our best to hold the seat open.''  Then the President nominated Judge This judge is eminently qualified to fill Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court, and there is no denying that whatsoever.  Let me tell you some things about him. He is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law He earned a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University and served as a law clerk for two Supreme Court  During a decade in private practice, he earned a reputation as a distinguished trial and appellate lawyer. He served with distinction in the Department of He was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by a unanimous voice vote in this body.  The record he has built during his decade on the bench has earned him the universal respect of his colleagues both on the bench and the bar. This judge is eminently qualified to do what the President appointed him to do.  Faced with an unquestionably qualified nominee, my friends on the other side of the aisle, my Democratic colleagues, have continually moved the goalpost, setting test after test for this judge to meet. But do you know what? This judge has passed all of those tests, all with flying colors, so the people on the other side of the aisle--the Democrats in the minority--are left with a ``no'' vote in search of a reason.  Let's go through some of their arguments. First, the minority leader announced that the nominee must prove himself to be a mainstream judge. Is he a mainstream judge or not? Well, consider his record: Judge Gorsuch has heard 2,700 cases and written 240 published opinions. He has voted with the majority in 99 percent of the cases, and 97 percent of the cases he has heard have been decided unanimously. Only one of those 2,700 cases was ever reversed by the Supreme Court, and it happens that Judge Gorsuch did not write the opinion.  Then consider what others say about him. He has been endorsed by prominent Democratic members of the Supreme Court bar, including Neal Katyal, President Obama's Acting Solicitor This Acting Solicitor General wrote a New York Times op-ed entitled ``Why Liberals Should Back Neil Gorsuch.'' Mr.Katyal wrote: ``I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.''  He went on to write that the judge's record ``should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him.''  Likewise, another well-known person, David Frederick, a board member[[Page S2191]]of the liberal American Constitution Society, says we should ``applaud such independence of mind and spirit in Supreme Court nominees.''  So after hearing what people on both the right and the left have said about the judge, it is clear that he is ``mainstream,'' but the goalpost seems to move. Next we hear that the judge doesn't care about the ``little guy'' and, instead, rules for the ``big guy.''  First of all, that is a goofy argument. Just ask liberal law professor Noah If you ask Professor Feldman, he says this criticism is a ``truly terrible idea'' because ``the rule of law isn't liberal or conservative--and it shouldn't be.''  The strategy on this point became clear during our hearing: Pore through 2,700 cases, cherry-pick a couple where sympathetic plaintiffs were on the losing end of the legal argument, then find a reason to attack the judge for that result, and then, because of that case or two, label him ``against'' the little guy. As silly as that argument is, the judge himself laid waste to that argument during the hearing when he rattled off a number of cases where the so-called little guy came out on the winning end of the legal argument of a case.  At any rate, as we discussed at length during his hearings, the judge applies the law neutrally to every party before him, and that is what you expect of judges.  I disagree with some of my colleagues who have argued that judging is not just a matter of applying neutral principles. I think that view is inconsistent with the role our judges play in our system and, more importantly, with regard to the oath they take. That oath requires them to do ``equal right to the poor and the rich'' and to apply the law ``without respect to persons.'' Naturally, this is what it means to live under the rule of law, and this is what our nominee has done during his decade on the bench of the Tenth Circuit Court of So the judge applies the law ``without respect to persons,'' as he promised in his first oath he would, and he will repeat the oath when he goes on the Supreme  Then, of course, as they move these goalposts, the judge has been criticized for the work he did on behalf of his former client, the U.Government, when he was at the Justice  Of course, we have had a lot of nominees over many years who have worked as lawyers in the government. Most recently, Justice Kagan worked as Solicitor As we all know, she argued before the Supreme Court that the government could constitutionally ban pamphlet material. That is a fairly radical position for the U.Government to take. When asked about that argument during her hearing, she said that she was a government lawyer making an argument on behalf of her client, the U.Government, and it had nothing to do with her personal views on the subject. Now, there is a whole different standard for some people of this body. That answer is apparently no longer good enough. To hear the other side tell it, government lawyers are responsible for the positions their client, the U.Government, takes and the positions they have to argue. I respect my colleagues who are making this argument, but this argument does not hold water.  What, then, are my colleagues on the other side left with after moving these goalposts many times, after making all of these arguments that don't stick? What are they left with? Because they can't get any of their attacks on the judge to stick, all they are left with are complaints about the so-called dark money being spent by advocacy groups. Yes, that is where the goalpost took them--to dark money.  As I said yesterday, that speaks volumes about the nominee, that after reviewing 2,700 cases, roughly 180,000 pages of documents from the Department of Justice and the George Bush Library, thousands of pages of briefs, and over 20 hours of testimony before our committee and hundreds of questions both during and after the hearing, all his detractors are left with is an attack on the nominee's supporters--people out there whom the nominee probably doesn't even know. They raise money to tell people about him, which they have a constitutional right to do under the First Amendment freedom of speech.  The bottom line is that they don't have any substantive attacks on this nominee that will stick, so they shifted tactics, yet again moving the goalpost, and are now trying to intimidate and silence those who are speaking out and making their voices heard in regard to this nominee.  Here is the most interesting thing about this latest development: There are advocacy groups on every side of this nomination. There are people out there for him, raising money and spending the money for him, and there are people out there against him who are raising and spending money so people know why they disagree with this nominee. Of course, that is nothing new. That has been true of past nominations, and there is nothing wrong with citizens engaging in the First Amendment freedom of speech and in the process of being for or against and encouraging public debate on whether a person ought to be on the Supreme It was certainly true when liberal groups favoring the Garland nomination poured money into Iowa to attack me last year for not holding a hearing. For that reason, I didn't hear a lot of my Democratic colleagues complain about that money that could well be called dark money as well.  There are groups on the left who are running ads in opposition to this nominee and threatening primaries. They are actually threatening primaries against Democrats who might not tow the line and might not help filibuster this nomination. For some reason, I am not hearing a lot of complaints about the money that is being raised to make some Democrats who might support this nominee look bad.  As I have said, there is nothing wrong with citizens engaging in the process and making their voices heard. This is one of the ways we are free to speak our minds in a democracy. It has been true for a long, long time.  As I said yesterday in the committee meeting, if you don't like outside groups getting involved, the remedy is not to intimidate and try to silence that message; the remedy you ought to follow is to support nominees who apply the law as it is written and then, in turn, leave the legislating to a body elected to make laws under our Constitution--the Senate and the House of  Regardless of what you may think about advocacy groups, about their getting involved, there is certainly no reason that they should go to great lengths to talk about this in our committee or talk about it to the nominee because he can't control any of that.  The truth is, the Democrats have no principled reason to oppose this nomination, and those are words from David Frederick that I have quoted before. It is clear instead that much of the opposition to the nominee is pretextual. The merits and qualifications of the nominee apparently no longer matter.  The only conclusion we are left to draw is that the Democrats will refuse to confirm any nominee this Republican President may put forth. There is no reason to think the Democrats would confirm any other judge the President identified as a potential nominee or any judge he would nominate. In fact, we don't even need to speculate on that point because the minority leader has spoken that point and made his point very clear. Before the President made this nomination, he said: ``I can't imagine us supporting anyone from his list.'' So it was very clear from the very beginning that the minority leader was going to lead this unprecedented filibuster. The only question was what excuse he would manufacture to justify it. The nominee enjoys broad bipartisan support from those who know him, and he enjoys bipartisan support in the  I recognize that the minority leader is under very enormous pressure from special interest groups to take this abnormal step of filibustering a judge, because filibustering the Senate is not unusual but filibustering a Supreme Court Justice is very unusual. I know other Members of his caucus are operating under those very same pressures as well. In fact, yesterday, while the committee was debating the nomination, a whole host of liberal and progressive groups held a press conference outside of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, demanding that the campaign arm cut off campaign funds for any incumbent Democrat who[[Page S2192]]doesn't filibuster this nominee. Those groups argue that because the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had already raised a lot of money off the minority leader's announcement that he was going to lead a filibuster, the committee shouldn't provide that money to any Member who refused to join this misguided effort.  Well, all I can say is that it would be truly unfortunate for Democrats to buckle to that pressure and engage in the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice nominee in U.history--another way to say that is, the first partisan filibuster in the 228-year history of our country since 1789. If they regard this nominee as the first in our history worthy of a partisan filibuster, it is clear they would filibuster anyone.  I have stated since long before the election that the new President would nominate the next Justice and the Judiciary Committee would process that nomination. That is just what we have done through the committee, and now we are doing it on the floor. So I urge my colleagues not to engage in this unprecedented partisan demonstration. Everyone knows the nominee is a qualified, mainstream, independent judge of the very highest caliber. Republicans know it, Democrats know it, and the left-leaning editorial boards across the country prove that even the press knows it. I urge my colleagues on the other side to come to their senses and not engage in the first partisan filibuster in U.history and instead join me and vote in favor of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2190-4.txt,457,ALZHEIMER'S IN AMERICA,2017.0,4.0,January
4285,topic-id,585,"Mr.President, I have several of my colleagues on this side of the aisle who want to speak, but I just want to take a minute and a half or so to clarify some things I have heard from the other side that need to be counteracted.  First of all, I don't know whether they mentioned the term ``Ginsburg rule,'' but we do have this Ginsburg rule that was set out a long time ago when Judge Ginsburg came before the Senate for her confirmation.

That is what we expect of every judge. The judge's decision not to offer his opinion on issues that may come before him is consistent with judicial ethics rules and is consistent with what I have referred to already as the Ginsburg rule or the Ginsburg standard, which all Supreme Court nominees in recent memory have followed. As Justice Ginsburg said, commenting on these issues is not fair to parties who might come before the Court in future years. That is what Judge Gorsuch said as well.  Questions to this end are nothing more than an attempt to compromise the judge's independence, and he showed us that he wasn't going to have his independence compromised because he is going to do what judges should do: look at the facts of a case, look at the law, and make those decisions based only on that and send no signals whatsoever ahead of time of how he might view something.  Along these lines, my colleagues said that the judge should have announced that he agreed with the ruling in Brown v. Board of Education but didn't offer enough information about this opinion in an appropriate discussion of precedent.[[Page S2200]]  I will quote our nominee. He said this: ``Senator, Brown v. Board of Education corrected an erroneous decision, a badly erroneous decision, and vindicated a dissent by the first Justice Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson, where he correctly identified that separate to advantage one race can never be equal,'' end of the quote of our nominee. So the judge spoke about precedent very appropriately. He answered our questions in a manner consistent with his obligations and with past nominees.  One more point. I keep hearing complaints that the judge won't make a commitment to follow Roe v. Wade, but my colleagues' requests really boil down to a quest for a promise to reach results that they want. They demand adherence to Roe v. Wade on the one hand and a promise to overrule Citizens United on the other hand, as examples. Asking the judge to make commitments about precedent is inappropriate. I have said this so many times, and my colleagues will repeat it many times as well. It compromises the judge's independence.  Instead of being beholden to the President, my colleagues would have the judge be beholden to them. This nominee isn't going to be beholden to a President, and he is not going to be beholden to any Senator because if he did that, he would be compromising his views.  I yield the floor.

4279,topic-id,954,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for her important remarks just now and for her leadership and her friendship to so many of us. She has been an extraordinary hero of mine, personally, and so many of us look to her leadership. So I thank her--and for her speaking on the nomination of Judge  Across the street from this Chamber stands the U.Supreme Above its doors are the words ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' As Senators, we have a solemn responsibility to ensure that every man and woman who sits on that Court upholds that ideal. As a U.Senator, I take that responsibility extremely seriously.  Almost two decades after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, I was part of only the second class to integrate the Berkeley, CA, public schools. If the Court had ruled differently, I likely would not have become a lawyer or a prosecutor or a district attorney or the Attorney General of California, and I certainly would not be standing here today as a U. I know from personal experience just how profoundly the Court's decisions touch every aspect of Americans' lives, and for that reason, I rise to join my colleagues in strong opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme  As we know, Judge Gorsuch went through 4 days of hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and here is what we learned: We learned that Judge Gorsuch refused to answer the most basic of questions. He initially even refused to share his views on Brown v. Board of We learned that Judge Gorsuch has a deeply conservative worldview. And we learned that Judge Gorsuch interprets the law in a theoretical bubble, completely detached from the real world--as he puts it, ``focusing backward, not forward.'' If Judge Gorsuch joins the U.Supreme Court, his narrow approach would do real harm to real people, especially the women of  America deserves a Supreme Court Justice who will protect a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own health. Judge Gorsuch will not. Judge Gorsuch carefully avoided speaking about abortion, but he has clearly demonstrated a hostility to women's access to healthcare.  Last year, when the court he sits on sided with Planned Parenthood, Judge Gorsuch took the highly unusual step of asking the court to hear the case again.  Judge Gorsuch determined that a 13,000-person, for-profit corporation was entitled to exercise the same religious beliefs as a person. That meant the company did not have to provide employees birth control coverage and could impose the company's religious beliefs on all of its female employees. I ask my colleagues, why does Judge Gorsuch seem to believe that corporations deserve full rights and protections but women don't?  As we mark Equal Pay Day today, Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who will protect the rights of women in the workplace. Judge Gorsuch won't. In employment discrimination cases, Judge Gorsuch has consistently sided with companies against their employees. These employees include women like Betty The facts of the case were undisputed. Her boss repeatedly asked her about her sexual habits and breast size and invited her to his home--then fired her when she reported his sexual harassment. Judge Gorsuch ruled against Why? Well, part of his justification that he offered was that she waited 2 months before reporting the harassment.  Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who upholds the rights of all women, including transgender women. Judge Gorsuch won't. When a transgender inmate claimed that the prison's practice of starting and stopping her hormone treatment was a violation of her rights, Judge Gorsuch disagreed.[[Page S2197]]  As the National Women's Law Center observed, his ``record reveals a troubling pattern of narrowly approaching the legal principles upon which everyday women across the Nation rely.'' They write that his appointment ``would mean a serious setback for women in this country and for generations to come.''  But judging by his record, if Judge Gorsuch becomes Justice Gorsuch, women won't be the only ones facing setbacks. Take Luke, a young boy with autism whose parents sought financial assistance after switching him from public school to a school specializing in autism education. Judge Gorsuch ruled that the minimal support Luke received in public school was good enough. People in the autism community were up in arms. And in the middle of a Senate hearing 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Judge Gorsuch was wrong on the law.  Consider Alphonse Maddin was a trucker who got stuck on the road in subzero temperatures--minus 27 degrees, as he recalls--and abandoned his trailer to seek help and save his life. For leaving the trailer, he was fired. Judge Gorsuch wrote that the company was entitled to fire Maddin for not enduring the cold and for not staying in his freezing truck.  Then there is Grace Hwang, a professor diagnosed with cancer. She sued when her university refused to provide the medical leave her doctor recommended. Judge Gorsuch called the university's decision ``reasonable'' and rejected her lawsuit. Sadly, Grace died last summer.  Judge Gorsuch has Ivy League credentials, but his record shows he lacks sound judgment to uphold justice. He ignores the complexities of human beings--the humiliating sting of harassment, the fear of a cancer patient or a worker who feels his life is in danger. In short, his rulings lack a basic sense of empathy. Judge Gorsuch understands the text of the law, to be sure, but he has repeatedly failed to show that he fully understands those important words: ``equal justice under law.''

4073,topic-id,2881,"Mr.President, this has been a nice morning for me. To have both the majority leader and the minority leader say such nice things means a lot to me.  Having said that, let me just say I am concerned about this body and how it is going. I am also concerned about the I personally wish he would choose his words a little more carefully because everybody in the world pays attention to the President of the United  On the other hand, I kind of find it refreshing that he doesn't take any guff from anybody. I like that. He is a person who speaks his mind, but I have also seen him change his mind after saying he was for something and change it when he got more facts.  He is a brand new President coming right out of the private sector. He is picking excellent people for his I don't know that I have ever seen any President pick better Cabinet members than he has, not the least of whom will be the two who should go through before the end of this week. Congressman Price is a tremendous choice. As both leaders had indicated, he probably has as much knowledge about our health care system as anyone on  Steve Mnuchin--I didn't even know Steve Mnuchin, but I spent hours with him. I have to say he is brilliant. I said to him: You know, Steven, you are going to lose a lot of money by taking this job. He said: I don't care. I want to serve my country.  I was refreshed by this attitude to the point that I am going to help him every way I can to become the greatest Treasury Secretary we have ever had. I will tell you one thing, he does understand a lot about money. He understands a lot about Wall He understands a lot about business acquisitions and business matters. He is a practical person, as is our  I don't know that we should be so sensitive sometimes because he oftentimes repeals what he said afterward, and I find that refreshing too. I happen to like this I think he is a refreshing new leader for this country. He is not going to play these same old games that almost everybody who has been President has played.  He reminds me a lot of President Reagan in that regard. Of course, Reagan had been a Governor before he came here and a good Governor, but he didn't take himself too seriously, and he would say some things that got him in trouble from time to time too. They all have, haven't they? I guess, being President, every word you say is being carefully weighed.  This President is going to have to realize that as well. I think he will. He is a very bright man. I think we are lucky that we would have somebody come out of the private sector into the White House, with all the flaws, and flaws that people are finding with Donald Trump, and be willing to take the criticisms and fight back sometimes. Is he perfect? Is he ever going to be perfect? No, he is not, but neither will any of us ever be perfect.  I will say this. A lot of us have more experience than he has. On the other hand, in my eyes, isn't it wonderful to have someone who has been immensely successful in the private sector--who has had some very tough realities in the private sector, who has had his ups and downs in the private sector, who understands pain, who understands exhilaration--isn't it wonderful to have someone like that who just may be able to pull this country out of the stinking mess it is in, a mess caused by a superabundance of bureaucracy, by arrogant Members of Congress, and by very liberal States that are dependent upon the Federal Government rather than upon themselves? I could go on and on and on.  Let us give this President a little bit of a chance. Above all, let us give him his Cabinet and let us quit playing these games. I know some on the Democratic side must feel they are making headway by playing these silly games, knowing that these Cabinet officials are going to go through while they stopped them from being able to do the job that needs to be done. They have made it more difficult than any President I recall in my time in the U.They are treating this President in a very belligerent, awful way. So I think we ought to give a little bit of leeway for him to make some verbal mistakes from time to time--even though we all wish he wouldn't.  I will say I think it is time for this body to start working and, more importantly, start working together. There is nothing we cannot do if we work together. We can save this country if we work together. We could have a better attitude in this country if we will work together. We can be an exemplar for the rest of the world if we work together.  Look, there is no excuse for these two big fights that are going on. I like big fights on the floor. I like big fights in committees. Sometimes out of those fights comes very good legislation or very good approaches to government. It is good for us to go at each other from time to time. But to make it impossible for a President to have his Cabinet early on? There is something wrong with this approach.  Some people are using this particular situation to enhance their ability to run for  I will say it would be wonderful if, once again, we could get Democrats and Republicans to work together. I remember in the early days, when I became one of the youngest committee chairmen of a major committee in history, when I became chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee--which is now the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--there were nine  Senator Kennedy came over from the Judiciary Committee, which he had chaired, to become my ranking member. There were seven Democrats, including Senator Kennedy, but two of our Republicans from the Northeast were from States that were quite liberal then. I couldn't blame them, but I knew that Kennedy had the 9-to-7 ideological edge. I was going to be chairman, and I could determine some things, but I wasn't going to be able to get much done unless I had some help from Senator  Senator Kennedy was not known for being cooperative up to that time. He was not known as a person who really aligned with Republicans to try to get things done. He was known as a bomb[[Page S979]]thrower and as somebody who really was one of the most articulate, liberal Democrats in this body.  In his own way, he was a very interesting and good Senator, but he was not known for bipartisan work at that time. When he came over and said: I will work with you, there are some things I can't do--meaning the unions, the feminists, et cetera--but I will help you, that is how the Hatch-Kennedy relationship began and began to bear fruit.  It could not have happened, except for two tough people with differing principles who were willing to get together and set aside their differences and do some things that were not only important to the country but beneficial to the country. We were known as the odd couple. He would laugh about that in public and say: We are known as the odd couple. I would always point to him and say: We all know who the odd one is, don't we.  He would laugh. He was a fun guy to be with. When he was serious about something, he could be a formidable challenger, but he earned the right to be that. He didn't just pop off because he wanted to be He earned the right, he earned our respect, and he earned my respect. From that time forth--he was considered a very great Senator at that time, but he was not considered a great legislator. He went on from there and became a great legislator. I know because we worked together on things that are law today and good laws today. He had to learn to be able to compromise to be able to get this type of work done--and so did  We have to earn respect here. It isn't just by popping off on the Senate floor, it is by working as hard as we can to do the best we can for our constituents, for the people in this country of both parties--of all parties--in the interest of everybody.  I wish we could get more of that back. I miss Senator I could talk to him. I could pull him off his liberal perch. I could get him to do things that nobody could get him to do up until that time, and he could get me to do some things I wasn't inclined to do at the beginning. But as we worked them out, we found out that some of the things we both agreed on--by pulling each other together--became some of the most important bills in history.  I would like to see more of that here. I wish to see us all start working together. A good way to do that would be to give the President the Cabinet he needs and wants. Maybe that is one reason why he is saying some things that those on the other side are finding fault with and maybe on my side are finding fault with. He doesn't have his As President, he doesn't have the advisers he needs. We are not helping him here--as We are not helping him get the people around him whom he needs. We are delaying, obfuscating, and fighting against people whom we shouldn't be fighting against.  In terms of Congressman Price and Steven Mnuchin, these are two extremely important men for two extremely important positions who are left floundering because we are unwilling to get the job done. If there were real arguments against them, that is another matter, but some of the phony arguments that have been brought up are just pathetic.  I remember when one of the Democrats wanted to be Treasurer of the United He had some real flaws. He even hadn't paid taxes in some ways, but he was a good person and wanted to serve his country. We worked out the difficulties, and he was able to serve as Secretary of the I can name a number of others. If we want perfection here, we are crazy. Nobody is perfect, and everybody has some things that they wish they didn't have in their biography.  But I can say this: I was very disappointed in this body for holding up Jeff Sessions, who is a really good person. I haven't always agreed with Jeff Sessions, but I knew one thing: He was honest in his beliefs, and he was courteous in making his arguments. He did a lot of things that really were right. Frankly, the fact that we differed was kind of irrelevant because he was worthy of his position. I could go through a number of others.  Let me just say that I happen to be one of the people who really like the minority leader in this body. I think he could become one of the great leaders of this He is smart; we all know that. He is aggressive; we all know that. He has had some degree of success around here; we all know that. He represents a huge constituency; we all know that. He is a good man; we all know that. And he has a good family; we all know that. Let's get rid of some of the picayune fights around here, and let's start working together.  The majority leader, Senator McConnell, in my opinion, is the best majority leader we have had here in a long, long time. He is smart. He understands the system. He loves the He is a very honest and good man. He is tough as nails. I am sure he has flaws, just like all the rest of us.  But these are two really potentially great leaders who could not only bring us together but could help us to save this country at a time when it needs saving, where we have $100 billion in unfunded liabilities--I mean trillion dollars; not billion, trillion dollars--where we are deeply in debt. We are now $20 trillion in debt.  These two gentlemen could bring us together and could help solve these problems if we would put the politics aside, for the most part. We have to have some politics here, or this would be an uninteresting body, but we don't have to have it on everything. If these two gentlemen could get together--they are both bright, they are both smart, and they both have given a lot of time to the U.I like both of them. I could say I love both of them. If they would really start working together, we could turn this country around. But to do that, the distinguished Senator from New York is going to have to be concerned about the national debt and the annual deficit, and the distinguished Senator from Kentucky is going to have to worry a lot about what motivates the Democrats and what we can do to find common ground with the  I believe these two men can do that, and I am hoping with all my heart they will, and I am praying for them every day, that they might get together and that we might put aside party politics in favor of bringing this country out of the mess it is in. I believe they can do that, and I believe we can help them do that. I would like to see it done because we can't keep going the way we are going.  I actually believe the President will grow into becoming a great President, too, if we will help him a little bit rather than just fight everything he does or everything he says or try to criticize him every time he opens his mouth. I would like to see us show some respect for the President too.  I have a lot of respect for these two leaders. They are great men. But I would like to see them be greater so that they will work together. You will notice I am just saying ``work together.'' I would like it to be this way, all the way together, but I will take this, if we could just get people to work together around here.  I have said enough. I just want these two leaders to know that I am pulling for both of them, and I am hoping we can still have our fights and still have our arguments and still have the enjoyable aspects around here of comradeship and working with each other. But I am hoping we can set aside some of these animosities and give the President his Cabinet and his leaders so that he has at least a shot at pulling this country out of the mess it is in. It is going to take a President It is not going to take another one of those--I believe President Trump is the person who is right for this time. I believe he will do a terrific job if we will help him. We will have differences, but I believe he will pay more attention, and I believe we will get better people to come into the government to help him to do this work and his job.  I may be a little bit naive in thinking that we can do all of this, but I think we can. And that is said by somebody who was told: You don't want to work with Senator Kennedy because he is a rock-ribbed liberal who doesn't really care about what Republicans like. Well, I found that by working with him and he found that by working with me we were able to do things that helped our country. It was partly because he was a prestigious Senator, no question, and partly because I am an active, hard-working, fighting Senator who kind of appealed to him because he knew he had somebody who would help fight these things through, and I was smart enough to be able to help him to get things done in better ways than they would have been done.[[Page S980]]  Well, I have said enough. I just love this body. I personally have been very moved by the kindness of the two leaders, and I just hope we can get together and do these things the right way. We are not going to go anywhere with constant bickering and fighting and the constant running for President that we have around here. I don't mind that. I mean, I think there is something to that, but it can't be every time a person opens his or her mouth.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

I will first address Nominee Gorsuch to the Supreme Then I will discuss the nomination of Tom Price to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, which is currently pending before the  Last week, President Trump nominated U.Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin I want to address both the process and the substance of what lies ahead for the  The Constitution gives to the President the power to nominate and, subject to the Senate's advice and consent, the power to appoint judges. The first step in the Senate exercising its power of advice and consent is to decide the best way to handle a nomination made by the  The Constitution does not mandate a one-size-fits-all process. In fact, the Senate has handled the Supreme Court nominations in at least a dozen different ways.  Nearly 1 year ago, shortly after Justice Scalia's death, I explained on the Senate floor the two reasons the next President should choose his replacement. First, the circumstances and timing of the Scalia vacancy supported separating the confirmation process from the Presidential election season, which was a hard-fought Presidential election.  When he chaired the Judiciary Committee in 1992, then-Senator Joe Biden urged the Senate not to consider a Supreme Court nomination in that Presidential election year. Each of his four reasons applied, with even greater force, to the circumstances we faced last year.  Second, I said that elections have consequences. The American people were increasingly concerned about the illegal and unconstitutional actions of the Obama administration, actions that the courts struck down dozens of times.  The two Presidential candidates last year represented very different ideas about the power and proper role of judges in our system of government. The American people, therefore, had a unique opportunity to address the future course of the judiciary in general and the Supreme Court in particular.  Not surprisingly, the percentage of American voters who said that the Supreme Court was a very important issue tripled between 2008 and 2016. The issue was always when, not whether, the Senate would consider a nominee to fill the Scalia vacancy.  Plunging into a divisive, ideological confirmation battle in the middle of a confrontational and ugly Presidential campaign would have done more harm than good to the judiciary, the Senate, and the country. We were right to avoid such damage and, as a result, today we can focus properly on the appointment of Justice Scalia's successor.  Democrats and their left-leaning allies, however, sound as though they exist in some kind of parallel universe. In editorials since the election, for example, the New York Times claims that Republicans stole this Supreme Court seat from President  I am sure they are in denial about the election results, and some observers have called this bizarre fiction sour grapes. I think that gives sour grapes a bad name, between you and me.  No judicial position, including the Supreme Court seat occupied by Justice Scalia, belongs to any President Obama exercised the power that the Constitution gives him by nominating someone to that vacancy. The Senate exercised the power that the Constitution separately gives us by not granting consent to that nomination.  I have news for my Democratic colleagues: Not getting your way does not mean that anyone stole anything; it just means that you did not get your way.  When Chairman Biden refused to give a hearing to more than 50 judicial nominees during the 103rd Congress--a record, by the way, that still stands--the New York Times never said that those seats were being stolen from President  When Democrats blocked a confirmation vote 20 times during the 108th Congress, the Times never accused Democrats of theft but was right there egging them on.  Republicans last year decided to defer the confirmation process without knowing who would win the election. Democrats this year are objecting because of who won the election, even though at the time, it looked as though Hillary Clinton was a sure winner.  I think we should stop the nonsense and act like grownups because we have work to do.  Turning to that work, the task before us is to determine whether Judge Neil Gorsuch is qualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Qualifications for judicial service include both legal experience and judicial philosophy, and I believe we should look at a nominee's entire record for evidence of these qualifications.  Judge Gorsuch's legal experience is well documented and widely acknowledged. Judge Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court Justices, spent a decade in private practice, and then served as Acting Associate Attorney His qualifications for the U.Court of Appeals were so obvious that the Senate confirmed him in 2006 without even a roll call vote.  Let me put that into perspective. During the 4 years that Republicans were back in the majority, 2003 to 2006, the Senate took roll call votes on 86 percent of judicial nominations. Democrats were demanding roll call votes even when, as happened 82 percent of the time, the nominations were unopposed. In other words, it was a very rare exception for a judicial nomination to be confirmed without a roll call vote at all. That is how self-evidently qualified this nominee was for the appeals court.  In 11 years on the appellate bench, he has authored hundreds of majority or separate opinions, many of which have been widely praised. There is no question that Judge Gorsuch has the legal experience to serve on the Supreme  As I have said many times, the conflict over judicial appointments is really a conflict over judicial power. The more important qualification for judicial service, therefore, is a nominee's judicial philosophy, or his or her understanding of the power and proper role of judges in our system of government--in other words, the kind of Justice he will be.  Federal judges have two basic tasks. They can perform those tasks in two basic ways. Their tasks are to interpret and apply the law to decide cases. They can perform those tasks impartially or politically.  An impartial judge interprets statutes and the Constitution to mean what they already mean, while the political judge interprets them to mean what he wants them to mean. When an impartial judge applies the law, he deliberately excludes his own views and does not put his thumb on the scale to make sure the results of the case benefit a particular party or group.  The political judge accepts, and even embraces, that his background and biases shape his decisions and considers how individual decisions will affect other parties, groups, or issues.  Our system of government, and the liberty it makes possible, requires impartial judges in all cases.  In his farewell address in 1796, President George Washington said that the heart of our system of government is the right of the people to control the One of his original Supreme Court Justices, James Wilson, described our system of government by saying that here, the people are masters of the government. Our liberty can be secure only if the people control the Constitution, only if the people remain masters of the government. That cannot happen if judges control the Constitution because then, government will be the master of the people. That is why the kind of judge Presidents appoint is so important. Impartial judges[[Page S988]]let the people govern; they let the people govern themselves. Political judges do it for them.  The best way to tell which kind of Justice the nominee before us will be is to assess the kind of judge he already is. One of the most obvious places to look is in the opinions he has been writing for more than a decade. Last year, for example, the Tenth Circuit had to decide whether to use the Constitution to create new categories of lawsuits against law enforcement officers. Judge Gorsuch agreed that the courts should resist doing so and wrote:       Ours is the job of interpreting the And that      document isn't some inkblot on which litigants may project      their hopes and dreams . . . but a carefully drafted text      judges are charged with applying according to its original      public meaning.  In other words, the Constitution is not a blank check a judge may write to whomever, and for whatever amount, they like. It is not a shape-shifting blob that judges can manipulate into whatever they want it to be.  In this view, Judge Gorsuch was merely echoing America's Thomas Jefferson, for example, argued that if the Constitution means whatever judges say it means, the Constitution will become ``a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.''  He was right. The Constitution, after all, is the primary way the people set rules for government, including for the judiciary. If the people are to remain masters of the government, they must remain masters of the Constitution, and that includes not only what it says but also what the Constitution means.  Impartial judges take statutes and the Constitution as they are, not for what they say but also for what they mean.  Political judges act as if the people and their elected representatives established a Constitution or enacted statutes that are merely collections of words with no meaning until judges fill in those blanks. Judge Gorsuch is an impartial judge. Anybody looking at the record has to know that. He knows that he is to interpret but cannot make the law. He knows that the Constitution must control judges, not the other way around.  Last year, Judge Gorsuch delivered a lecture about Justice Scalia's legacy at Case Western University School of In that lecture, Judge Gorsuch embraced a defined judicial philosophy and made clear the kind of judge that he is.  I referred to this lecture in my remarks last week, and this week I sent it to each of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I truly hope each and every Member of this body will read it carefully because it helps answer the most important question before us in exercising our power of advice and consent: What kind of Justice will this nominee be?  In his lecture, Judge Gorsuch said--and I will refer to the chart again--``Judges should be in the business of declaring what the law is using the traditional methods of interpretation, rather than pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own political views, always with an eye on the outcome.''  Some Senators and liberal groups have already stated that they oppose this nomination. Perhaps they think judges should be in the business of pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own political views.  Judge Gorsuch said in his lecture that the task of a judge is to interpret and apply the law rather than, as he put it, ``to amend or revise the law in some novel way.'' Perhaps his critics believe the opposite, that judges actually do have the power to amend and revise the law in novel ways.  Last year, Judge Gorsuch echoed America's Founders in saying that the power of the legislative branch to make law and the power of the judicial branch to interpret law should be kept separate and distinct. Confusing them, he said, would be a grave threat to our values of personal liberty and equal protection. Perhaps his critics believe it does not matter whether judges make or interpret the law.  Last year, Judge Gorsuch said that judges must ``assiduously seek to avoid the temptation to secure results they prefer.'' What the law demands, he said, is more important than the judge's policy preferences. Perhaps his critics think judges should give in to that temptation, putting their preferred results ahead of what the law demands?  The more we find out about Judge Gorsuch and his judicial philosophy, the more we should ask what his opponents and critics really find so objectionable. If Democrats and their leftwing allies believe that judges, rather than the people, should control the Constitution, they should come right out and say so. If they believe that the political ends justify the judicial means, that judges may manipulate the law to produce politically correct results, then they should be honest about it and defend that radical idea to the American people.  As I close, I want to offer some wisdom from Daniel Webster, who served in the House and Senate and twice as Secretary of State under three different In a speech on March 15, 1837, he said:       Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption      of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the      Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers      of good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to      govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good      masters, but they mean to be masters.  Well, there are also judges who mean to be good masters, but they do indeed mean to be masters. They mean to govern well, but they do mean to govern. That kind of judge compromises the heart of our political system and undermines the liberty that it makes possible.  Judge Neil Gorsuch has no intention of governing, of being any kind of master of the Constitution or of the people. He is, instead, an impartial judge, the kind who follows rather than controls the law. He will be the kind of Justice that America needs on the Supreme  ",CREC-2017-02-09-pt1-PgS976-5.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,April

4088,topic-id,906,"Madam President, I would like to turn to the business currently before the Senate and express my support for the nomination of Representative Tom Price to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services at this critical juncture.  HHS encompasses an extremely large and diverse set of agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration, just to name a few. All told, its annual budget is more than $1 trillion--that is trillion with a ``t.''  The various programs and agencies that fall under HHS's purview have an enormous impact on our Nation's fiscal and economic outlook. I am not exaggerating when I say that HHS affects the daily lives of more American taxpayers than any other part of the Federal  Management of all these agencies is not for the faint of heart. Once confirmed, Price will have his work cut out for him, but I believe he is more than up to the challenge. He has proven that over the years.  Price has extensive insight into our Nation's health care system, having practiced medicine for two decades in a variety of settings. That experience has informed his years of service in the House of Representatives, which included a tenure as chairman of the House Budget Committee and in the leadership in the Ways and Means  While many who come to Washington are content to sit back and talk about our Nation's problems, Price has always sought to find solutions. At a time when our health care system is in distress, I believe Price will put his[[Page S989]]vast experience to good use and be decisive in not only working with Congress to find solutions but implementing them as well.  My view on his qualifications is shared by a great number of people, including many who see the problems in our health care system up close. For example, former HHS Secretaries Mike Leavitt and Tommie Thompson enthusiastically support his nomination. Major stakeholder organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, most surgical specialty groups, and others, also support him. In their letter of support, the Health Care Leadership Council, which represents a wide range of health care providers, said that ``it is difficult to imagine anyone more capable of serving his nation as the Secretary of HHS than Congressman Tom Price.'' I couldn't have said it better myself.  Of course, none of this seems to matter to some of my colleagues on the other side. They aren't coming to the floor to criticize Price's abilities or qualifications; instead, most of what we have heard for weeks now is focused on a vague patchwork of allegations of ethical impropriety on the part of the nominee.  I have participated in quite a few confirmation debates during my time in the Senate, and even over this agency. One thing I have learned is that if the opponents of a particular nomination keep moving their focus from one set of allegations to another, more often than not, they don't have a leg to stand on. That is very much the case with regard to the attacks that have been hurled at  First, we heard about supposed conflicts of interest in his finances, until it was pretty clear that Price had followed all the required ethical guidelines and disclosure requirements of the  After that, he was accused of lying to the Senate Finance Committee during our vetting process because he had to file an amended disclosure to include some mistaken omissions. Of course, this is not altogether an uncommon occurrence, particularly given the fact that the Finance Committee's vetting process is uniquely exhaustive. It happens in almost every case where you have people who have had a complicated life or work life. Furthermore, he was asked about this during his confirmation hearing, and his answers were reasonable, and I haven't heard anyone credibly argue that he was intentionally trying to mislead the committee.  I will set aside the fact that the particulars of Price's disclosures to the Finance Committee--information which is typically kept private among members and staff--were apparently managed and embellished in order to create and reinforce a partisan narrative with the media. Instead, I will simply say that the Finance Committee's bipartisan vetting process for nominees has historically operated on an assumption of good faith, both on the part of the nominee and the members of the committee. The fact that my colleagues on the committee, in many respects, have decided to cast all that aside in recent weeks is not evidence of wrongdoing on the part of  When the overblown claims about his disclosures failed to gain traction, my colleagues on the other side turned their focus to a particular investment in an Australian biomed company in 2015. Their claim: Price received a ``sweetheart deal'' from the company which allowed him to purchase stock at a discounted price. They also argue that he lied during his confirmation hearing when he said he paid the same price for the stock as everyone else at that time.  Now, my colleagues would have everyone believe that private placement investment arrangements are inherently shady and nefarious. Let's just get that out of the way right now.

4092,topic-id,1268,"Well, let me just go back.  Let's just get that out of the way right now. Private placements are a commonplace and appropriate means for companies to raise additional capital from a small number of investors. I know because I used to practice law and I did a number of private placements in my experience.  The facts in this matter are relatively simple: The Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, had a relatively small number of U.investors at the time. It is my understanding that all of the investors who had participated in a previous share offering were offered an opportunity to purchase additional stock as part of a private placement arrangement. Price purchased additional stock at the price that was offered to all the investors in that group.  Once again, private placements are commonplace investments, not nefarious conspiracies that some of our colleagues would have us believe. And I can certainly testify to that. According to all the available details, this particular investment was in compliance with all of the laws and regulations that govern those types of deals. In fact, as private placement investments go, this one appears to be fairly unremarkable, unless, of course, you just assume without evidence that there simply had to be something fishy going on--an assumption that I don't think could be made.  Put simply, this investment arrangement was a perfectly normal, commonplace affair. There is certainly no evidence to suggest that there was any insider trading, as some of my colleagues have alleged.  On top of that, Price's statements before the Finance Committee, despite many claims to the contrary, appear to be truthful unless you simply want to assume without evidence that he has to be lying. What a situation that our colleagues try to put this good man in. It is disreputable, in my opinion.  By all accounts, Price purchased the Innate stock at the same price offered to all other participants in the private placement which, by the way, also included a few thousand investors from Australia and New That is what he told the committee and that, by all appearances, is the truth. We certainly haven't seen any evidence to the contrary. Sure, my colleagues on the other side have thrown a lot of dots on the wall, apparently hoping they can create a cloudy impression that something nefarious just had to be going on with this investment, even though they haven't come close to connecting any of the dots. They have parsed words, they have divined alternative meanings behind the nominee's statements. But let me be clear, no one has produced any credible evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Those of us who know him know that he never did any wrongdoing and, frankly, never intended to do anything that was wrong.  That being the case, it is utterly shameful that my colleagues would go to such elaborate lengths in order to malign not only a nominee for a Cabinet position but a sitting Member of the U.There ought to be some courtesy here, and I am kind of shocked that there isn't. Of course, we went through a fairly ugly episode the other night about the same issue, though that one hit a little closer to home as the nominee under attack was a fellow  I don't want to rehash that argument here today. Instead, I will say this. I know some people like to fight around here. For some, it seems the fighting is half the reason they are here to begin with, and neither party is blameless in that regard. Do you know what? If my colleagues wanted to have a fierce and lively debate about this nominee's qualifications or his views on policy, I welcome that debate. He is a tremendous human being, a tremendous doctor, with all kinds of experience, and has been a wonderful Member of the House of Representatives for both parties--as a If they want to fairly debate his record as a legislator[[Page S990]]and a public servant, I am game. I will be glad to do it with them, but to throw accusations at a congressional colleague, and even go so far to accuse him--without evidence--of criminal wrongdoing is, in my view, beneath the dignity of the  That is precisely what has happened to Ultimately, my colleagues' specious arguments and their desperate attempt to block Price's confirmation would all seem far more sincere if he were the one nominee or even one in a small handful of nominees they deemed unfit to serve, but that is not what is happening.  My colleagues on the other side have appeared to be apoplectic about almost every single nominee we have had before us. The confirmation of any of President Trump's Cabinet nominees, it seems, will bring about untold destruction, the likes of which America has never seen.  With so many of these nominations, the entire process has been wrought with fever-pitched arguments, accusations, and apocalyptic visions of a future world gone mad. We hear it in committee. We are hearing it on the floor. Then the Senate votes, the nominees are confirmed, and my colleagues immediately switch gears to do the very same thing with the next nomination. Some of them even switch gears and come up to the nominee with smiles on their faces and congratulate him or her.  One can only wonder how so many Senators can keep their outrage settings turned to 11 without getting completely exhausted around here. I expect they are able to do so because their outrage is more show than anything else. Indeed, I suspect that the outrage that has been on display has less to do with the particular nominees and more to do with a longer term political agenda. In service of that partisan agenda, my colleagues appear to be more than willing to cast aside the traditions, respect, and assumptions of good faith that have long been the hallmark of the Senate confirmation process and of the Senate itself.  I am very concerned with the way this has gone on here. I am concerned with the way my colleagues are treating another respected colleague from the We have seen it in committee. We are seeing it on the floor. In my view, it is a tragic shame.  The bottom line is, Price is, by any reasonable objective standard, qualified to serve as HHS Some people would say he is qualified just because he has made it all the way to Congress and he ought to be treated with equal respect, but I will not even go that far. I will just say, by any reasonable and objective standard, he is qualified to serve as HHS There is nothing in his past record or statements that disqualifies him to serve in that capacity. In a better world, he would be confirmed already. People would be shouting hooray that this good man will take the time and spend the effort to take this very thankless, very difficult job--and to leave Congress in the process. I suspect he will be confirmed in short order.  Once again, I do urge my colleagues to vote with me to confirm Representative I really believe we ought to get past this is picayune stuff that has been going on, on the floor. We ought to get past that and truly, truly support a good man from the other body who we all know is honest and decent and allow him to see what he can do to straighten out this tremendously complex Department of Health and Human  Madam President, I yield the floor.

4276,topic-id,945,"Mr.President, over the next hour, a number of my colleagues and I will join together to speak in opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme We are joining together today because this nomination is not just about the future of the Supreme It is about the future of our country.  There is no question about Judge Gorsuch's credentials or about his intellect. He is a graduate of Columbia and Harvard and has been a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court for more than a decade. In fact, his credentials are in stark contrast to so many of the dangerously unqualified individuals President Trump appointed to his  Judge Gorsuch should not get a pass simply because we are relieved that President Trump didn't nominate a member of his family or a reality television personality for this job. Credentials cannot and should not be the only points we consider when evaluating a lifetime appointment to the Supreme In fact, we should expect that anyone nominated to the Supreme Court will at least have impressive credentials.  By many accounts, Judge Gorsuch would be the most conservative Justice on the Court--even more conservative than Justice Thomas or Justice Rightwing advocacy groups cheered his nomination and have spent over $10 million to support his nomination. They spent this money because they have high confidence that he will rule in their favor on so many of the tough cases that will come before the Supreme These groups, including the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, selected Judge Gorsuch because he meets their litmus test for how they think a Justice should rule. They selected him because they understood Judge Gorsuch clearly met the litmus test the President outlined during his campaign.  To paraphrase, Donald Trump wanted a judge who would prioritize the religious freedom of a corporation over the rights of its employees, uphold an expansive view of the Second Amendment, making it much tougher to enact sensible gun legislation to protect our communities, and who would overturn Roe v. Wade--as Donald Trump put it--automatically.  Judge Gorsuch's credentials are just a starting point. For the people who need justice most urgently, Judge Gorsuch's view of the law and his judicial philosophy will make a world of difference. The working families, women, differently abled, people of color, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, students, seniors, and our Native peoples are the people who will be impacted by the decisions a Justice Gorsuch would make.  Today, April 4, is Equal Pay Day, which means that it took women until today to make the same amount that men made in 2016. Women have had to work more than 3 months longer to catch up, on average, to men.  This significant pay disparity has existed for centuries, but it has been illegal in the United States since the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963. Proving illegal pay disparity under this law has been challenging, as we all know.  Nationally, women are paid only 79 cents for every dollar a man is paid. In Hawaii, women are paid only 82 cents for every dollar a man makes. That is a little better than the rest of the country, but it is in no way good enough.  At the median salary, that 82 cents translates into about $8,000 less per year in wages for a woman in That is a lot of money in my State, where the high cost of living makes it even more difficult for working families to get ahead--not to mention that many working families in Hawaii, as well as in other States, are headed by women. My immigrant family was headed by my mother.  As we mark Equal Pay Day, I am well aware of the tremendous impact a single Justice can have on the lives and rights of millions of  Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has issued numerous 5-to-4 decisions that have favored corporate interests over the rights of individuals--cases like Shelby County, Citizens United, and Hobby  One of the most deeply flawed of these 5-to-4 decisions was in a 2007 case called Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber That decision had the effect of denying justice to a woman who had suffered pay discrimination for more than a decade. The Court said, in effect, that because Lilly Ledbetter didn't learn of the pay discrimination until it was too late, our justice system could not help her.  Put another way, under the ruling, employers could discriminate against women so long as the employers made sure the women didn't find out about it.  This will not be hard to do, as employers are not likely to announce that they are providing discriminatory pay to their female employees. This is what happened to Lilly She didn't know.  This decision was deeply wrong and surprised many Court watchers. It undid years of judicial precedent.  I remember learning of this decision in I was serving on the House Education and Labor Committee of the U.House of Representatives at that time.  The Supreme Court decision interpreted a Federal law that fell within the jurisdiction of the committee on which I sat. George Miller, then chair of the committee, immediately announced that we would change the law to be interpreted the way it had been before the Court applied their own narrow and wrong interpretation.  We passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act with a Democratic Congress in 2009. Frankly, I doubt a Republican-controlled House and Senate would have done the same. It was the first bill President Obama signed into law. I was there for that bill signing.

4282,topic-id,753,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for her impassioned, well-reasoned, persuasive remarks.  All too often, Judge Gorsuch fixates on what we call the plain meaning of a word in the law and decides on his own meaning that he would give to that word. Sometimes he will resort to the Dictionary Act or Webster's dictionary to ascertain what he would consider the plain meaning of the law, but what he doesn't do time and again in very important cases that impact lots of lives is that he doesn't look to the context or the purpose of the law, to the point where sometimes his decisions are just bizarre and lack common sense.  There was a reference made to the TransAm Trucking case where the truckdriver was in freezing weather. The brakes on his truck were not working properly, so he faced the choice of freezing to death or doing something about it but then risking being fired. So he did something about it. He got fired.  Judge Gorsuch, in his reading--a very, very narrow reading of a word in the applicable provisions--deemed that his firing was correct. He was asked by Senator Franken at the hearing: What would you have done if you had been in that situation? There you are, you are about to freeze to death, and you have a truck that is not operable in a safe way unless you unhook the attachment to it. What would you have done?  Judge Gorsuch basically said: I don't know what I would have done. I was not in his shoes.  What any of us would have said--of course we would have done what the truck driver did. But in his very narrow reading of the words of the applicable provision, he came to the decision he did. That is why he could not respond to Senator  It is particularly important that Judge Gorsuch explain to us how he would approach these kinds of cases. It is particularly important in what I would describe as remedial legislation, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, better known as This is remedial legislation that protects the educational rights of special needs children. That is the population for which this law was enacted.  Judge Gorsuch had a case before him, and it was referred to by my colleague from A young boy was not getting the kind of educational opportunities that he should have gotten under IDEA, but Judge Gorsuch read that remedial legislation, which should be broadly interpreted to protect the class and the group that the law was passed to help--he read it very, very narrowly.  He said that the school needed only to provide ``merely de minimus'' education for this child. He put in the words ``merely de minimus'' effort on the part of the school to provide this young boy with educational opportunities. That was bad enough, but Judge Gorsuch added the word ``merely.'' So during the time of his hearing, the Supreme Court, in a related--basically the same law, IDEA, was at issue--and the Supreme Court, while we were having the hearing on Judge Gorsuch's nomination, unanimously overturned Judge Gorsuch's standard of ``merely de minimus.'' Even the Roberts Court found Judge Gorsuch's standard of review too limiting and too narrow.  So the young boy in question--his father testified at the confirmation hearing. I asked him what he was thinking as the decision of Judge Gorsuch came down. He said he knew that this decision would negatively affect hundreds and hundreds of special needs children all across our country.  This is why I sought assurance from Judge Gorsuch that he would be the kind of Justice who understands, as he told me when I met with him, that the purpose of title III, which are the Federal courts, is to protect the rights of minorities. So I wanted reassurance from Judge Gorsuch during his hearing. I tried time and again to get a sense of his heart, what his judicial philosophy was. I was looking for the reassurance that he was the kind of judge who understands the importance of assuring that victims of discrimination cannot only ask for but can also receive protections from the courts and who demonstrates a commitment to the Constitutional principles that protect the rights of women to make the intimate and personal decisions of what to do with their own bodies.

4284,topic-id,736,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague, Senator Murray, our assistant Democratic leader, for her continuing, longstanding leadership on behalf of women and families in our country.  Over the past hour, my colleagues and I have laid out a fair case against confirming Judge Gorsuch to the U.Supreme As we approach a vote on his confirmation, I encourage my colleagues to scrutinize Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, even as he refused to outline for us or describe for us what that philosophy is. But we have come to certain conclusions based on 4 days of hearings. During his hearing, Judge Gorsuch refused, as they say, time and again to answer our questions on his judicial philosophy or his approach to the law. He insisted that he was merely a judge, as if the use of the word ended any discussion or scrutiny of his record.  Judge Gorsuch painted a picture for us of the Court that is really straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting. He said during his hearing: ``One of the beautiful things about our system of justice is that any person can file a lawsuit about anything against anyone at any time . . . and a judge, a neutral and fair judge, will hear it.''  Norman Rockwell painting--it is a wonderful idea that anybody can file a claim to protect their rights or interests. It is also a wonderful idea to assume that those claims will be heard and ruled upon by neutral judges, apparently uninfluenced by their own strongly held and frequently expressed personal views and judicial philosophy.  Many of my Republican colleagues have echoed this view and argued that Judge Gorsuch's credentials should be enough--Columbia, They argue that it is wrong or even unfair to question how Judge Gorsuch might approach the kinds of difficult issues that come before the Supreme  Of course, if judicial philosophy did not matter, then the Republicans would not have engaged in the unprecedented act of blocking President Obama's nominee--as I mentioned, Merrick Garland, a well-credentialed, well-respected moderate nominee--from even having a hearing. In fact, many of the Republican Senators did not even extend the courtesy of meeting with Judge They would not have held the seat open to be filled by the appointee of a Republican President, one selected for him by rightwing organizations.  When my colleagues and I asked Judge Gorsuch about his judicial philosophy, he said that his words, his views, his writings, and his clearly expressed personal views had no relevance to what he would do as a He told us to look at his whole record, so I examined his whole record. I saw in that record too little regard for the real-world impact of his decisions. I saw a refusal to look beyond the words to the meaning and intent of the law, even when his decisions lacked common sense, as in the frozen truck driver case, and far too often, to the benefit of big corporations and against the side of the little guy.  The decisions of judges have real-world impacts for millions of people beyond the parties in a particular case. This is especially true of the Supreme Court, which issues decisions that don't just reach those in the case in front of them--the frozen trucker, the women who work at Hobby Lobby faced with a lack of critical healthcare, the special needs child entitled to educational opportunities under the The Supreme Court does not just interpret laws; the Supreme Court shapes our society.  Will we be just? Will we be fair? Will America be a land of exclusivity for the few or land of opportunity for the many? Will we be the compassionate and tolerant America that embraced my mother, my brothers, and me so many decades ago when we immigrated to this country? These values seem too often absent from Judge Gorsuch's record and from his view of the law and the  The central question for me in looking at Judge Gorsuch and his record and listening carefully through 4 days of hearings was whether he would be a Justice for all of us, not just one for some of us. I came to the conclusion that he would not be a Justice for all of us, so I oppose his nomination.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson).

During her 8-year tenure at the Department of Labor Department, she proved she has the skills to manage large multifaceted organizations as well as to initiate needed reforms and new programs that help create jobs and competiveness in the workforce. Quite frankly, she was the best Secretary of Labor the United States has ever had.  During her tenure, the Department updated the white collar overtime regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which has been on the agenda of every administration since 1977. The most significant regulatory tort reform of President Bush's first term, the new regulations provided millions of low-wage vulnerable workers with strengthened overtime protection.  In 2003, under her leadership, the Department achieved the first major update of union financial disclosure regulations in more than 40 years, giving rank and file members enhanced information on how their hard-earned dues are spent. The Department set new worker protection enforcement records, including recovering record back wages for vulnerable low-wage immigrant workers. The Department also launched comprehensive reform of the Nation's publicly funded worker training programs, to better serve dislocated and unemployed workers.

4101,topic-id,2755,"Mr.President, I also rise to speak about the nomination of Congressman Price as HHS I will oppose his nomination, principally because he has been an opponent of virtually every program that provides health care access to people with modest means in this country: Medicare, Medicaid, the S-CHIP program--which he called socialism--Planned Parenthood, which is the primary health care provider of choice for millions of women, and the Affordable Care  There is much to talk about, but I am going to focus my comments today on his repeated promises to repeal the Affordable Care Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would be very unwise. It would be heartless, and it would be economically foolish. The Virginia stats are instructive. In Virginia, 179,000 Virginians have been able to enroll in Medicaid since the ACA was passed--an additional 179,000--and nearly 380,000 Virginians have been able to get coverage through the marketplace.  We have not done the Medicaid expansion program. If we did, another 400,000 could receive care through the Nearly 4 million Virginians have protection against discrimination on the grounds of preexisting health conditions. They have such conditions, and they could be turned away from insurance companies, as they have been in the past, as my own family has been.  Before the ACA, only those with employer coverage got tax benefits to help pay for health insurance. Now, 320,000 moderate- and low-income Virginians get tax credits averaging $275 a month to help. In addition, there are nearly 5 million Virginians with employer-sponsored insurance, and over 800,000 Virginians would lose access to free preventive care under Medicare if the ACA were to be repealed.  Nationally, a repeal of the ACA--under an estimate of the Urban Institute--would cause 30 million people to lose their health insurance. That is the combined population of 19  We had a hearing last week in the Senate HELP Committee about the Affordable Care It was called, by the majority, ``ObamaCare Emergency.'' I asked the witnesses, Democratic, Republican, and of no political identification--I asked them: Would a repeal of the Affordable Care Act with no replacement be an emergency? All of the[[Page S998]]witnesses agreed that it would. One of the witnesses said it is more than an emergency, it would be a catastrophe.  So then I asked those witnesses--again, bipartisan witnesses: We shouldn't repeal it. That means we should fix it or repair it or reform it or improve it. Should we do a fix or improvement hastily, carelessly, and secretly or should we do it openly, publicly, carefully, and deliberately?  They all said: Of course, we should not rush. We should get this right. That is why many colleagues on our side have asked Republicans to sit down with us and let's make improvements, but don't push people off of health insurance.  It would also lead to a significant economic catastrophe for hospitals, for providers, to have a repeal and not know what comes next. Remember that health care is one-sixth of the American economy. If you inject uncertainty into that, you have consequences that we could not now predict that would be negative.  The real story is not any of these statistics, and I will pick up on what my friend, the Senator from Arkansas, said. The real story is about individuals, patients, and what happens. Three weeks ago, I put on my Web site a little section, kaine.senate.gov/acastory. I asked people to submit what it would mean to have a repeal of the Affordable Care  To date, I have had 1,654 submissions of what it would mean to them. We have been able to follow up on some of them and get permission from some so I could read their stories on the floor. So during the remainder of my speech, I am just going to tell you what a repeal of the ACA would mean to people all over my  Michael Dunkley lives in Alexandria       I was diagnosed with advanced Stage 4 non-Hodgkin's      lymphoma cancer in October of 2013 and was put immediately on      an extremely powerful 5-component chemotherapy treatment      program that would conclude in late January, 2014. My medical      insurance coverage at the time of my diagnosis was under the      terms of COBRA, and my monthly premium was $875, with a      $7,500 deductible and a $15,000 out-of-pocket limit.       My COBRA coverage expired at midnight on December 31, 2013,      and was immediately [able to be] replaced [because of a] plan      that I had been issued through the provisions of the . . .      Affordable Care Because of the new law, I could not be      denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition (advanced      cancer), and I was issued a new plan that was far superior in      coverage and cost me only $575 a month, with zero deductible      and an $1,850 out-of-pocket limit. 3 days after receiving my      new health insurance coverage, I was infused with my 5th-     round of chemotherapy, for which I was charged $35,000.      Near the end of January, 2014, I received a 6th-dose of      chemotherapy and was billed another $35,000. . . . I was      given a PET-CT nuclear scan that cost $5,000, and 1 week      after that, on February 14, 2014, my wife and I were told      by my oncologist that my advanced cancer [was now in]      complete remission. As I am the sole caregiver for my      wife, who has advanced Multiple Sclerosis, the news of the      cancer's remission was a life-saver for her as well as      myself.       Had it not been for the Patient Protection and Affordable      Care Act, I would not have been able to purchase [my] health-     care insurance, for any price, due to my pre-existing      condition of having cancer. Had it not been for the income      subsidy, I would have not been able to afford to pay the      premium for a superior plan, a plan which saved my life.

My husband      and myself have made our home their home, but their struggles      have continued because of the enormity of their medical      expenses.       Since they have been able to enter the Affordable Care Act      for their insurance, they have been able to stabilize their      lives financially.

Like many struggling Americans, I cannot afford      insurance and rely on low income/free clinics to receive      preventive care. The ACA helped programs like the one at the      Community Health Center [clinic] with funding.       We cannot afford to lose clinics like this one with cuts to      funding public health. Americans should not be denied health      care. We should not have to file for bankruptcy for becoming      sick or avoiding a doctor all together because it costs too      much. The Affordable Care Act should be revised, not      repealed. If Congress repeals the ACA, 20 million Americans      risk losing insurance. That's 20 million Americans that may      stop going to doctors because they can't afford it.

Thank You, Corwin       Sarah Mullins-Spears, Prospect, VA:       Senator Kaine, I have one perfectly imperfect child. He has      not one but two ``pre-existing'' conditions. . . . He was      diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome . . . and he was also born      with a unicameral bone cyst, a hollow bone. . . .  That affects one in four children.       This year we were able to purchase our lifelong dream. . .      . A family farm. . . . 18 PERFECT acres of peace and promise.      This summer we endured a medical ordeal we could have NEVER      imagined. . . . My son broke his arm, due to the cyst, for      the 4th time in less than 3 years. . . . And we were finally      approved for surgery to place a titanium rod through the cyst      that would prevent any further breaks. On July 26th the      surgery was successfully completed and the next day we were      released with instructions on pain management and to not      remove the surgical bandages for 3 days. On July 30th we      removed the bandages to find a hot, swollen, bright red      nightmare. We were readmitted to the hospital. . . . I wasn't      truly afraid until I saw the face of the same nurse that      discharged us that night. . . . she was fighting back tears.      . . . Over the next 3 days there were 2 additional surgeries      including a PICC line, and after 6 days we were released to      home health care. . . . Suddenly I was a health care      provider, every 8 hours a dose of antibiotics had to be      attached to the PICC line, it took approximately 90 minutes      to administer, and then the line had to be cleaned and      prepped. There was NEVER a 6 hour window that I could be away      from my child. . . . Which meant I was not able to work the 6      hour schedule at my part time job. Which means after the      second week I was let go, told I could reapply when I was      ready to come back to work. . . . On August 26th my son slept      for almost 20 straight hours and then woke up vomiting and      with a fever. . . . So by lunch we were readmitted to the      hospital again. . . . The next day while in the hospital he      broke out in a mystery rash from head to toe, and had a white      blood cell count of a chemo patient. For me this was the      worst, because no one, not even the consult from UVA      infectious diseases, knew why. After 3 days, with the WBC      count trending up and more research, the leap of faith was      decided to end all antibiotics and see if they were the cause      for the reactions. They were and by October my child was      declared healed and eligible to start school. . . . Almost 5[[Page S999]]     weeks after he should have started his first day of middle      school. . . . By then the bills had also begun to arrive . .      . The first bill from the hospital was $105,547.12      before insurance and over $12,000 with benefits. We are still      receiving bills and our pre insurance totals are well over      $750,000 before insurance. . . . BUT because of ACA we were      capped at $7,500 out of pocket. This means $231 a month for      24 months which has an impact on our family but it also means      we can still afford our mortgage. I wake up every morning      thankful for my healthy child and amazed that we live on this      tiny piece of heaven. ACA made that possible for us.

It took three experimental      surgeries to remove and replace the tumor with a metal      implant and bone graft. I was fortunate enough to be      dependent on my parents' insurance when this medical event      first took place. With the Affordable Care Act I have been      able to stay on my parents' insurance into college and      graduate school and maintain my health status through regular      doctors' visits. I require a yearly check-up to make sure      that the medical implant is intact and that the bone graft is      growing successfully. Within the next 5-10 years I will need      another surgery to replace the metal implant with new      technology. If the implant breaks or I have any kind of      accident that injures my jaw I will require emergency surgery      and most likely to have my jaw wired shut. I will turn 26 in      October and no longer be eligible to be on my parents'      insurance. Thanks to the affordable care act I can rely on      being able to maintain affordable insurance and feel      comfortable about my health. I can trust that I will not be      turned away due to my pre-existing condition of a metal jaw      and history of aggressive tumors. I can be sure that I will      not reach a lifetime limit of coverage when I need another      surgery, (or if the worst happens and I need to have      emergency surgery). When the doctors first found this tumor      when I was seventeen, they told me not to go to college      because I needed so many surgeries. I was planning to attend      art school in Maryland, my parents lived in Connecticut and      my doctors were in I was determined not to let a      medical problem control my life. I went to and graduated from      college in Maryland and am now enrolled in graduate school      pursuing masters of fine arts in Richmond I rely on      the affordable care act for safe and reliable access to      doctors all over the country.

4171,topic-id,1636,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the House to support H.1309, the TSA Administrator Modernization Act of 2017.  TSA was created within the Department of Transportation in 2001 to address the security vulnerabilities that were exposed in the attacks of 9/11. At that time, the administrator was given a 5-year term. However, when TSA and its functions transferred to the Department of Homeland Security a year later, the 5-year term officially terminated by statute.  Many of the issues and bureaucratic challenges that TSA faces today stem from a lack of consistent leadership at the top. Since I came to Congress in January 2015, TSA has had no less than five different individual administrators, both as appointees and as acting administrators. This is a staggering number in such a brief period of time.  A revolving door of leadership has further exacerbated the numerous problems that plague this young agency. It is unacceptable that this has gone on for more than a decade. The American people deserve better, and that is why we are here today with this bill.  This bill addresses these issues by reestablishing the administrator's position, level, and 5-year term, just as Congress originally intended when it created TSA in the wake of 9/11. Additionally, this bill updates Federal statute to reflect current policy by clarifying TSA's proper role within the Department of Homeland  While this is only one step in addressing the many challenges at TSA, this legislation will provide for more consistent leadership at such a critical security agency.  Ensuring the effectiveness of Federal agencies and the security of the American people is a bipartisan task, and one of which I am happy to be part of. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together to support this bill. This is exactly what the American people expect from us.  I especially want to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for moving this bill swiftly through committee to the floor today.

I rise in support of H.1309, the TSA Administrator Modernization Act of 2017.  When the Transportation Security Administration was created after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress intended for the administrator to serve a 5-year term, like the administrator of the Federal Aviation  However, since TSA moved from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, there has been a lack of clarity about the length of the administrator's term. The measure before us today clarifies Congress' expectation that TSA administrators serve for 5 years.  In TSA's short history, it has had six Senate-confirmed administrators. None has served more than 4 years. The last TSA administrator, Peter Neffenger, served just 2 years.  Stability at the top is critically important as we push TSA to improve its performance and address ongoing challenges.  For example, after recent covert testing carried out by the Department's inspector general revealed alarming weaknesses in checkpoint screening operations, Administrator Neffenger focused TSA's attention on addressing its detection rate failures, improving training, and reducing vulnerabilities associated with commercial aviation screening. At the same time, Administrator Neffenger worked with Congress to increase TSA staffing levels in response to long wait times at security checkpoints during the peak travel season last summer. Under his leadership, TSA successfully reduced wait times that had reached as long as 3 hours at some airplanes, without compromising the effectiveness of security measures. And while confronting those urgent short-term challenges, Administrator Neffenger was also focused on addressing TSA's longer-term challenges related to employee recruitment, retention, and morale.  I regret, as I know my colleague, Mr.Katko, does, that Administrator Neffenger did not have the opportunity to stay on and continue making progress within the administration. But I think we can all agree that TSA needs steady leadership in order to continue to evolve and fulfill its mission to protect the traveling public.  We can help ensure that TSA will have that stability and sustained focus at the top by passing this bill today.  I thank my colleague from New York, Representative Katko, for introducing this bipartisan legislation, and I urge all of our colleagues to give it their full support.  Madam Speaker, I urge support for H.1309. This bill was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month.  Enacting H.1309 will provide TSA with stable, sustained leadership the administration needs to chart a more consistent course and overcome its longstanding challenges.  I would also like to commend my colleague, Mr.Katko, who has been absolutely dogged in his support of TSA and ensuring that it has the support and the resources that it needs. I thank him for his work on this bill.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2210.txt,2264,FLOODING AND WATER STORAGE,2017.0,20.0,February

I thought they were excellent, and not just because they were nice for me.  Her comments about Admiral Neffenger, in particular, were very poignant because he was doing a great job at TSA and he was only there 2[[Page H2212]]years. What he did in 2 years really made a big difference in the trajectory of that agency. Much like other Federal agencies that are empowered to do very important things, like the FBI who has a long-term tenure, I think the same thing needs to be done here.  Admiral Neffenger and people like him should be in control of the agency for extended periods of time because then, and only then, can we make the true changes that we are going to need.

4287,topic-id,1751,"Mr.President, there are, of course, two issues before the Senate with respect to Judge Neil The first issue is simply, should or should not Neil Gorsuch be confirmed as an Associate Justice to the U.Supreme Court? There is also a second issue, and the second issue is, Should the Senate even be allowed to vote?  Those two questions are both important and interrelated. I want to talk about the first one first.  I sit on the Judiciary We heard last week--2 weeks ago--about 20 hours of testimony from Judge I think he answered about 200 questions in writing. One of the objections offered by our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democratic Party, was that Judge Gorsuch refused to answer some of the questions. Now that is just not accurate.  Many of the questions that were asked of the judge by both Republicans and Democrats were fair questions--some of them, not so much.  Judge Gorsuch was asked, in effect: What is your position on abortion? How will you vote?  He was asked: How will you vote on gun control?  He was asked: How would you vote on cruel and unusual punishment, the Eighth Amendment?  He was asked how he would vote on questions dealing with the Tenth He didn't answer those questions, and then he was criticized for not answering those questions. He didn't answer those questions because he couldn't. He is a sitting judge of the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Let me read to you canon 3(a)(6) of the Code of Conduct for United States It states: ``A judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.''  Let me read you rule 2.10(B) of the American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial It provides, and I quote: ``A judge shall not, in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the judicial office.''  Now, say what you want about Mr.Gorsuch, but don't criticize him for not violating the oath of his office and not making promises, pledges, or commitments, like a politician, on how he would vote on the U.Supreme Court, because Justices are supposed to decide the case on the merits.  As I mentioned, I watched Judge Gorsuch answer questions personally for over 20 hours. He was asked some other questions other than the ones I have referenced, and I was intrigued by some of the questions that Judge Gorsuch was asked. My friends in the Democratic Party kept trying to draw distinctions with Judge Gorsuch between the parties in cases that he had decided. My friends kept talking about the ``big guy,'' the ``little guy,'' the corporation, the consumer, the employer, the employee. The suggestion was made that Judge Gorsuch didn't vote enough for the little guy or little gal, for whatever that means. What struck me when he answered those questions was that we were supposed to be talking about the faithful application of justice. Now, I was taught in law school that Lady Justice is supposed to be blind, that neither the wealth nor the power nor the status of the parties should matter. That is why, in the picture that we see so often of Lady Justice, she is blindfolded. She isn't looking at the parties at all to see whether they are wealthy or not so wealthy. She isn't looking at the parties to see whether they are a corporation or a consumer or what race they are or what gender they are or what part of the country they are from. Lady Justice is supposed to be blind because we are a nation of laws, not men.  Of all the places in our country, an American court of law--and I am very proud of this--is supposed to be the place of last resort, where you can come and get a fair shake. That is how good judges operate. They give everybody a fair shake. A good judge is supposed to make his or her decisions based on the law, not the parties. Good judges are supposed to be impartial--to call it like they see it, to call the balls and strikes--and that is exactly what Neil Gorsuch has done throughout his entire career.  I can promise that, as I sit on the Judiciary Committee, if any President, whether he is a Republican or Democrat, ever brings a nomination before the Judiciary Committee when I am on that committee and that nominee starts talking about the wealth or the status or the power of the parties and how it will influence or not influence his decision, suggesting that will make a difference, I will vote against that nominee--I don't care who nominates him--every single time, because that is not American justice.  We talked about two cases in particular, and the Presiding Officer has probably heard them talked about here on the floor. On the surface they don't seem to be related. Judge Gorsuch ruled in both of these cases, but I think they interact in a very important way. They tell us that he doesn't play politics and he doesn't rule for the big guy just because he is a big guy or the little guy just because he is a little guy.  The first case we heard a lot about was a decision by Judge Gorsuch called TransAm You are going to hear a lot about that case. In that case, Judge Gorsuch made a decision that was unfavorable to a trucker, and he ruled in favor of the trucking company--little guy versus big guy. Judge Gorsuch ruled for the big guy, and it is important to know why and to look at the reasoning in that case and not just the result.  During the discussion on the case, Judge Gorsuch made it very clear that he only made that decision because he believed that was what the statute controlling the facts of the case required--a statute that was passed by a legislative body duly authorized by the people that make the law. Unlike our courts, which are supposed to interpret the law, Judge Gorsuch did not decide the case the way he did because he didn't sympathize with the trucker. He decided that case the way he did because he was doing his best to accurately apply the law, as best he understood it, to the facts before him. Once again, that is what is called justice--blind to the parties.  Actually, Judge Gorsuch has explained himself and what he thinks about decisions such as this. He did it in another case that I will talk about in a moment. Judge Gorsuch said:       Often enough the law can be ``a[n] ass--a[n] idiot''--  Quoting, of course, Charles Dickens--     and there is little we judges can do about it, for it is (or      should be) emphatically our job to apply, not rewrite, the      law enacted by the people's representatives. Indeed, every      judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad      judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the      law compels.  Now, that statement came from the second case I referenced. It was a case called A.In A.Holmes, a 13-year-old seventh grader was arrested for fake burping repeatedly in class. The majority said it was OK for him to be arrested and that, when his family sued the police officer, the police officer enjoyed qualified immunity.  Judge Gorsuch dissented. This time he ruled for the little guy, literally and figuratively. Judge Gorsuch said: ``In my opinion, reading the statute passed by the legislature, this young man's family can file this lawsuit because disciplining a 13-year-old 7th grader for fake burping in class by arresting him instead of disciplining him is a bridge too far.''  Now, once again, we had a little guy versus the big guy. This time Judge Gorsuch ruled for the little guy. But again, we have to look beyond the result. Even though he ruled for someone we can all sympathize with, Judge Gorsuch didn't base his decision on that. He based his decision on a good-faith application of the statutes of the facts controlling the case. He applied the law as written by the legislature. That is what legislatures do, and that is what Congresses do. They make the law and judges interpret the law. To be blunt, that is what we want in a judge.  I want a judge. I don't want an ideologue. I am not interested in a judge who will use the judiciary to advance his own personal policy goals. I want a judge who will apply the law as written by the legislature or, in the case of the Constitution, as written by the Framers of the Constitution, as best that judge understands the law, not to try to reshape the law as he wishes it to be.  To just comment about the last question that I raised earlier, again, one[[Page S2202]]issue is whether or not we should confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, but the second issue is whether the Senate should even be allowed to vote at all. That is what this is all about when you distill it down to its basic essence.  We are going to hear a lot about cloture, and we are going to hear a lot about the nuclear option. But this is what it boils down to: Should we or should we not even be able to be allowed to vote?  Now I understand that reasonable people can disagree. I also understand that unreasonable people can disagree, and everybody in this body has a vote, and we all represent There are two Senators from every State--big States and little States--and everybody is entitled to be able to vote his or her conscience. But it is very, very important not only for the American judicial system but for American democracy that the Senate be allowed to vote on Judge  So to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I would say: Please allow us to vote. You can vote for or against Judge I will not second-guess your judgment if you act sincerely, and I believe many of my colleagues are sincere. They are wrong, but they are sincere.

4221,topic-id,1090,"Mr.President, in December of 2015, President Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act after it passed this body with overwhelming bipartisan support--85 of 100 Senators supported the bill. The Wall Street Journal called the Every Student Succeeds Act ``the largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quarter-century.'' It also had the support of Governors, State legislators, chief State school officers, school district superintendents, local school boards, principals, and teachers unions, who all agreed on the need to replace No Child Left  The core of the education reform in the Every Student Succeeds Act was to restore local control to the States--not just control for them but that they would have the responsibility and the authority for things such as school accountability, teacher evaluation, student evaluation. It is very clear. In fact, the Every Student Succeeds Act says things very specifically. States are solely responsible for choosing which standards to adopt. The Secretary cannot mandate, direct, or control State standards. The Secretary of Education cannot require, coerce, or incentivize States to adopt common core State standards. States are responsible for choosing which assessments to adopt. The Secretary of Education cannot mandate, direct, or control State assessments for education. States design their own system for holding schools accountable and decide which schools to identify for school intervention and support. The Secretary cannot add new requirements or criteria on State accountability systems that are not in the law. States and local school districts decide what strategies they will implement to help fix identified schools without Federal interference. The Secretary of Education cannot prescribe how States and local school districts improve those schools.  Congress passed that clear education law to take power out of Washington, DC, and from the Department of Education and the Secretary of Education and hand it back to the  Five months after the bill was signed, the Obama administration changed their mind and released regulations to take back school decisionmaking and accountability, in direct violation of the law.  Eighty-five of one hundred of us agreed that our passion is for every school district, every parent, every State to take care of every child; that no child would be left behind by switching to local control rather than Federal centralized control. But when this new rule was put out by the Obama administration, they reinterpreted that clear law. Let me tell you what they said in the rule.  In the rule, they dictate to States the consequences for schools that don't annually test at least 95 percent of their students.  They prescribe to the States and school districts how they would intervene and improve schools that don't exit from this identification process of being an underperforming school.  They limit how States may measure school quality or student success based on 4-year graduation rates.  They define how much weight States must afford to non-test-based indicators in their accountability systems.  This regulation prescribes the long-term goals and measurements of progress that States would use for their student subgroups.  This new regulation prescribes when schools may exit from comprehensive support based on improvement.  This new regulation mandates that States comply with specific Washington, DC, created requirements instead of letting the school districts or the States determine how best to proceed on those requirements.  This new regulation limits how States award school improvement funding to school districts and schools.  This new regulation adds a new and burdensome reporting requirement every 4 years on States and local school districts that will drive up compliance costs and will divert resources away from students in the classrooms, in direct violation of what we passed.  This new regulation requires States to establish a statewide definition for ``infective teacher,'' requiring a statewide system of evaluation controlled by  This new regulation limits how students are scored when they have exited from special education.  This new regulation controls how the school report cards are created and how long they are.  This is what we were exiting from with No Child Left We said in that vote for Every Student Succeeds that Washington, DC, should not do this. This rule directly violated the spirit and the letter of the law and will put the new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, in charge of school evaluation, teacher evaluation, and student success. That is not her role or the intent of this law when we passed it, regardless of who is the Secretary of Our intent was to provide maximum flexibility for the States and the parents. The rule is central control from Washington,  It is essential that we stop this rule right now. While some of my colleagues have said: Let's just wait, and we will do regulations, and we will unwind some of this--they are basically admitting that the Trump administration will fix the Obama administration overreach. I understand that statement. I think there will be some unwinding of regulations, but here is why it must be done right now--two reasons. One is, when we do this right now with a Congressional Review Act, we settle this forever, that no administration ever, as long as this law is in place, can repromulgate a rule and turn right back around and say Washington, DC, is going to control teacher evaluation, student success evaluation, and school evaluation. This ends that forever.  The second thing is, right now schools in Oklahoma have already diverted resources in their administration, and they are filling out forms that are due to Washington, DC, in April to fulfill this new requirement that was put down by the administration. If we don't end this now, the districts in Oklahoma and in all of the States represented by this great Senate--their administrators will be working on forms for Washington, DC, rather than educating children at home. Let's get those folks back in the classroom, working on things that matter, not some form that no one in Washington, DC, will read anyway. Why don't we allow our schools to focus on educating kids instead of filling out forms for the Secretary of Education? That is the reason we passed the Every Student Succeeds  I encourage this body to support H.57 when it comes up. This will fix this overreach and will put a permanent marker down to say we meant it when Congress said to the administration: Do not control local education. Let the States and the parents do it.

4216,topic-id,727,"Mr.President, as the Senate has spent the last few weeks considering controversial nominee after controversial nominee, it is a refreshing break to consider David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Shulkin is a man defined by his professionalism, competence, and dedication to the mission of the agency he is tapped to lead.  The son of an Army psychologist and an experienced hospital system administrator, Shulkin was selected by President Obama to restore trust and confidence at the Veterans Health Administration after years of struggles punctuated by the horrible scandal of wait times in Under his leadership, the VA has made great progress. Amid a sea of questionable Cabinet nominations, Shulkin is one about which I have no question.  Of course, Shulkin will face immense challenges. The VA needs significant overhaul, not just in its practices and policies, but in its facilities and technology. In eliminating the backlog for access to health care and in the midst of tackling the backlog in claims, facilities have been short-changed with respect to needed improvements and upgrades, while experiencing increased usage. New technologies provide new opportunities for providing care, but they also require new investments.  Areas that are finally receiving the attention required include mental health, posttraumatic stress, and other lingering invisible wounds of war. It has been one of my priorities to ensure that the best science and practices with respect to mental health and posttraumatic stress can be spread to the communities where veterans live and work, like the rural communities of Only then will we see progress in improving the lives of veterans in those areas.  Shulkin must also rebuild the confidence of a VA workforce that has been unfairly targeted and vilified by some for the actions of a few. The Federal employees who work at the VA are among the most dedicated anywhere. Their devotion to improving care for veterans is inspiring, but their jobs have been made more difficult by both the disappointing actions of some individuals and the frustrating policies and organizational structures that sometimes get in the way of them serving veterans.  I believe that Shulkin is up to this challenge. It is evident from his testimony before the Veterans Affairs Committee and through his public statements that he believes in the VA and in the importance of its mission. It is evident that he understands the value of looking to the community for health care answers when that makes sense and that he also understands that the Nation should never ignore its solemn responsibility to care for veterans through all possible avenues. I am also reassured by his pledge not to dismantle the VA or turn its delivery of care into a voucher system. It is evident that he intends to speak his mind about what makes the most sense for leading a missive health care system focused on providing quality care to each individual veteran.  I will support Shulkin's nomination, and I look forward to working with him.  Mr.Mr.President, I am proud to support David Shulkin's nomination for Secretary of Veterans The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, faces massive challenges in delivering care to our veterans, but I believe that Shulkin is well equipped for the task at hand.  Shulkin has committed to fully implementing the Veterans Choice Program as Secretary and will work to expand this program to provide a network that meets the needs of veterans, their families, and providers in the community--every veteran deserves access to care, whether that be at the VA or in the community.  Through the Veterans Choice Program, we have seen more than 7 million appointments made for veterans in their communities, a network expanded by 350,000 providers and over 1.5 million veterans that have benefitted from using the Choice I will seek to build and expand upon this progress and look to Shulkin's support for legislation that would bring care in the community under an integrated and coordinated system that utilizes a Veterans Choice This will ensure access to timely, flexible, and quality care that our veterans have earned and deserve.  I believe that Shulkin is the person that can repair the culture of the VA to focus on the veteran and restore honesty and accountability to the I thank him for accepting this challenge to serve our Nation and look forward to working with him in the days ahead.

4125,topic-id,2548,"Mr.President, we have been talking a lot about the weather here in Washington, DC, the past couple of days. We got a little bit of snow yesterday in some parts. People are still kind of plowing out of their driveways. I am looking at the daffodils that were out 3 days ago, and they are now buried, and the cherry blossoms are a little bit crispy on the trees.  So many of us are not feeling like spring has really sprung here. But in Alaska, in my home State, when we think of spring, one of the things that brings a smile to the face of so many of us is that it means it is time for the Iditarod, the Last Great Race on It is an exciting time of the year for so many, when we come together to celebrate a 1,000-mile race across some pretty desolate territory in the State of  The race itself has a much storied history, one that is somewhat unique to the State of Alaska and to our culture. The race commemorates a lifesaving diphtheria serum run to the community of Back in 1925, diphtheria had raged through the community, and there was no way to get the serum to We did not have aircraft that could make it that far. Remember, it is pretty cold in February and in We still don't have a road. We really had no way to move the diphtheria serum.  So it was determined, after a great deal of debate and discussion and pros and cons that they would use a dog team relay to get the diphtheria serum to There are names of dogs that have now become infamous, like Togo, Fritz, and Balto, which led this amazing race. Today, the memory of that lifesaving race is lived on in a race that features just a little bit shy of 1,000 miles, again across pretty frozen isolated areas. It involves 1,000-plus dogs that are in the running.  For many of us, there are 1,000 more reasons that you really would not want to do that. But I have to tell you, as I look at these mushers, as I look at these dogs, and as I look at all that goes into the mushing history of our State, it makes me excited about not only the men and women who are the mushers but the true athletes, the K-9 athletes, and all that they give up.  I was home in Anchorage last weekend for the ceremonial start on It is a great deal of hoopla. There are not too many communities in America where you actually truck snow into the downtown part of your community, fill the streets up with snow so that the dog teams can launch from downtown. Thousands of people gather to watch the start. We were commemorating the 45th annual Iditarod race.  The official start was on Monday morning in Fairbanks, AK, a town that I also call home, having gone to high school there. The route this year was from Fairbanks, what they call the northerly route, up to It shaves a little bit of the miles off. I think this year it was about 979 miles. So it was not quite 1,000 miles, but still good enough to test a man or a woman and their dogs.  It was kind of tough starting in Fairbanks on the morning of the race. Temperatures were around 50 below. They hit the river, went right past the house where I grew up, and went downriver. By the time they got to the first checkpoint there at Tanana, the temperatures were 50 below and people were talking about how you stay warm on a sled and who has bad frostbite that is coming back after years of running.  Let's just put it this way. The Iditarod is not for the timid or the weak. It takes real grit to run this race. When you think about all the hoopla that comes with the ceremonial start and all the people who came out in the community, then you get on the trail and you are alone. You are by yourself. We have 26 different checkpoints between Fairbanks and As a musher reaches a checkpoint, there is an appreciative audience of the villagers who come out to cheer them on.  Again, the villagers can't offer help with taking care of the teams. The mushers have to do it all themselves. But there is a lot of time to think and reflect about the beauty surrounding you, a lot of time to worry about whether or not you have moose or wolf or bear or whatever is out there keeping them company. But truly, this is not only an endurance race, but it is a race that challenges the mind. There are stretches of just almost mind-numbing isolation in the cold where you are just focusing on your team in front of you.  But as you can see, when you get out--this is right on the outskirts of Nome; this is coming in at the end of the race--there is a lot of isolation out there. The temperatures that you are dealing with are tough on a human being. Over the course of this past week, the temperature range was a 70-degree range. The temperature in Nome yesterday at the conclusion was 4 degrees above zero. So it is on the positive side, which was good news for the mushers. But that is a pretty substantial range that you are going through.  It is an amazing race in terms of the strategy that goes into it. You would think: Well, you just get your dogs in line. You know where you are going to feed them. You know where you are going to let them rest.  But the strategy that goes into a race like this is really quite unique to the various mushers. What we have seen with this race is an extraordinarily fast race, where the winner was averaging between 10 and 11 miles per hour between some of these checkpoints. It is pretty extraordinary to have your dogs keep up a pace like this.  Some mushers will hop off their sleds and run alongside their dogs when they are going uphill, just to take some of[[Page S1834]]the weight off the sled. But think about that. You have been going for a week. You have been going around the clock pretty much for some of these. You are exhausted. You are freezing cold. Now you are going to jog behind your dogs to lighten the load. This is, again, extraordinary. Many of the others, as they are approaching the end, will keep their strongest dogs, shed the nonessential gear, and switch to a lighter sled to push through on the final stretch.  But there are a lot of different tactics. When a dog is tired, you can put them in the basket so the dog can rest, kind of like a coach on a basketball team: You need to be put on the bench and just kind of take a breather here. We do it with the dogs as well. But this is a race not only about the endurance, but it also is one where there is a great deal of work to ensure that these high-performance athletes are cared for and that their safety is looked after.  Again, if a dog gets too tired and is just not right, mushers can leave them at a checkpoint to ensure their well-being so that they are not pushed too much. Again, putting them in a basket, making sure that the dogs are cared for. There is a veterinarian at every step along the way. The vets check the dogs out at every checkpoint. The mushers have to carry the veterinary check record, if you will.  These vets are not local vets. There are some 50 vets that volunteer to come to Alaska for the Iditarod and go out there along the trail to one of these checkpoints and to do the checks before the race and after the race.  When I was in Anchorage last week, I was visiting with a veterinarian from The Presiding Officer probably might even know him. But he comes every year. This was his eighth He volunteers his time because, again, it is an amazing race with amazing K-9 athletes. They are the ones who get the care and attention. I don't know that there are any doctors out along the trail for the mushers, but the dogs are well cared for.  It is required and there is mandatory rest that is taken. Mushers can determine where the 24-hour rest period is taken. There are two 8-hour stops, one along the Yukon River and one at White Mountain, just before you get to But, again, you think about the demands on the individual as they are mushing along at this pace.  There is a story out of this year's race about a musher. I think it was day 3 into the race. A team comes into the checkpoint. They are clipping right along, but there is no musher. The musher had fallen asleep while standing on the runners of his sled and just kind of fell off his sled.  He had a pretty good team, if I can just say. They were obviously following the trail from teams ahead of them. That team just went on and ended up at the checkpoint there. It was a little while later that another musher came along and saw this musher walking, following his dog's footprints. He gave him a ride to the next checkpoint where his dogs were all there just waiting for him, saying: You know, we got here first. Where were you?  But it kind of speaks to some of the issues that go on along the trail. There used to be a time, up until this year, when there was no two-way communication devices that were allowed--none at all. So as to your cellphone, you could not have your cellphone with you.  It was designed to make sure you were not gaining unfair advantage in determining where other mushers were ahead of you or behind you. But for safety reasons, I think there is a recognition that being able to send out an alert if you need it is probably wise and important. A thousand miles is a lot of land to cover. There are a lot of things that can go wrong when it is just you and your dogs along the trail.  The news. The news is big about the 45th Iditarod race. This year, the winner, a fabulous gentleman by the name of Mitch Seavey, blasted the overall record--extraordinarily impressive. He set the Iditarod record of 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds. What is wonderful to add to this story is that this is the fastest time. The next fastest time, the fastest time that we had had up until this year, was the year prior, which was set by his son. Think about that. What athletic competition, what sport can you have a father and a son go in toe to toe beating the all-time record? Last year, the 29-year-old son was the winner. This year, the 57-year-old dad is the winner. And who came in second this year? The son.  When I was at the ceremonial start and I had the opportunity to see Mitch Seavey, I went up to him, and I said: OK, I know everyone is betting on Dallas Seavey to win because it would be win 5 for him, but I am going with the old guy.  Fifty-seven is not so old. Mitch Seavey certainly demonstrated that just yesterday.  The Seavey family is Iditarod legend. Dan Seavey, who is Mitch's father, ran the very first Iditarod in 1973, and then some 44 years later, his son Mitch and his grandson Dallas are still going at it. Mitch won in 2004 and in 2013, and his son Dallas won in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016--again, a father and son kind of trading off second and third places during each of these.  It is extraordinary when you think about the records that have been broken with this race, and the closeness of the race is exciting to look at. When the second and third place finishers came in--Dallas came in just 5 minutes ahead of the third place musher, Nicolas Petit, who calls Girdwood his hometown, as does one of our young pages here, and it is a place I call home as well.  So there is a lot of excitement with the winners, not only with Mitch Seavey's record-smashing race but also the fact that he is the oldest racer to win, at 57. Again, as he has reminded us, 57 isn't that old.  I will acknowledge that both Dallas and Nicolas Petit came in breaking last year's record as well.  So for the sixth year in a row, we have had a Seavey champion. You talk about a family of champions, this is pretty amazing. This one is Mitch's third win, and it is an extraordinary win.  I spoke to Mitch not too long ago to offer him my congratulations, and I told him: As a parent of two 20-somethings, I like the command you demonstrate. You have still got it in you. You are going to be a fierce competitor.  But what Mitch told me was really a lovely statement. He said that what was so great was to be at the finish line seeing his son coming in and seeing Dallas genuinely happy at Mitch's win. He said that they were head-to-head competitors all throughout the race, and Dallas didn't make that five-time win that he was hoping for, that so many of us Alaskans were hoping for, but he was so genuinely proud of his father.  As of this afternoon, we have 10 mushers who have crossed the finish line. I wish all of the other mushers and their fearless dogs good luck as they continue to make their way to Nome over the next few days and beyond.  This is an event that I love to celebrate with my colleagues. I love to brag about the amazing men and women, not just the Alaskans but from all over the country and really from all over the world. Our fourth place finisher is from Norway, Joar Leifseth He was right up there all the way to the end. It is men. It is women. Jessie Royer was the first woman in, and she came in fifth place. Aliy Zirkle crossed in eighth place. So they are remarkable men and women--Alaskans, Americans, and people from truly around the globe--who come to compete.  Truly the ones we celebrate with great enthusiasm and gusto are these canine athletes that demonstrate to us all that there is no end, there is no limit to their love to run, their love to compete, and their desire to excel.  I am pleased to be able to celebrate with colleagues from the Senate in recognizing the 45th Iditarod race, the Last Great Race on  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

4099,topic-id,1362,"Mr.President, I am going to be brief. I want to build on some of the comments Senator Warner made. It is unclear what President Trump's position is on repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care He has made all sorts of commitments all over the map, suggesting that he wants to deconstruct the act in full, suggesting that he wants to keep some elements of it, making promises that whatever comes next will be just as good, will be better than what consumers have today.  I think what you are going to hear consistently from our side is a willingness, a desire, an enthusiasm to engage in a conversation with Republicans about how to strengthen our health care system, how to repair the parts of the Affordable Care Act that are broken, but keep the majority of that legislation, which is delivering lifesaving care to people as we speak, and not descend into health care chaos by repealing this legislation with no plan for what comes next.  The genesis of our opposition, of my opposition, to Tom Price's nomination to be the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is that he has been, in the House of Representatives, the face of the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act with absolutely no plan for what comes next.  There were many other choices that could have been made for selections to head the Department and lead the conversation about the Affordable Care Act and its future that could have signaled that we were going to have an ability to come together. But when I was a Member of the House of Representatives, I watched my colleague, Tom Price, be the leader, the face of the campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with absolutely no replacement, which would descend our entire health care marketplace into chaos.  That is chiefly why I stand here in opposition to his nomination today. He did offer a token plan to replace it, but it had nothing of value to the people of It would have repealed Medicaid expansion with no plan for what came next. It would have repealed the insurance protections for people who are sick with a $3 billion high-risk pool that would never have met the needs of those who have serious illness and disease and who cannot find insurance.  Our worry is that we are on the precipice of repealing an act which has saved thousands of lives, which has insured 20 million people, and the results will be health care chaos for everyone, whether they are on the Affordable Care Act or not.  Tom Price has been the face of the repeal effort in the House of He has been the face of the irresponsible position of getting rid of this law with nothing that comes next. And it simply doesn't give us confidence that there is going to be a rational bipartisan conversation about how to improve our health care system.  This isn't politics. I just want to underscore the point that Senator Warner made. This isn't about scoring political points. This isn't simply about numbers. This is about human lives that are affected if Tom Price gets what he has been asking for during the last 6 years, which is a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act without any plan for what comes next.  This is a picture of Mark and his family from This is a picture of his daughter Dominique has a profound intellectual disability. She also has cerebral palsy. She doesn't have the use of her left arm. She walks with an unsteady gait. She also cannot chew food, so she takes liquid nutrition. But she has an amazing spirit. She loves school. She loves music. She loves singing to Disney movies. She plays soccer, buddy baseball, and rides a horse for therapy, but Mark and his wife used to spend $40,000 a year out of their own pocket for her care. The Affordable Care Act saved this family from potential bankruptcy. The Affordable Care Act now, through Medicaid expansion, allows Dominique to get care that is socially insured. And Mark asks:       After all, who are we as a people and a country if we      cannot take care of those who for no fault of their own      cannot take care of themselves? Dominique didn't do anything      wrong, she was born this way and deserves to have a      fulfilling life.  That is the whole concept of insurance: The idea that we should socialize the cost of caring for kids and adults who, through no fault of their own, get sick. But without the Affordable Care Act, this family bears the burden of caring for Dominique by themselves. And there is no replacement. There is no plan on the table today--certainly not Tom Price's reputed replacement plan in the House of Representatives--that offers any help to this family if the Affordable Care Act goes away.  Let me introduce you to one more family. This is a picture of She[[Page S997]]is hiding here--Angela from New Angela is 49 years old. She was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in 2015. The good news is that Angela is winning the fight against breast cancer, but she would face the inability to get health care insurance if not for the Affordable Care Act because if this family ever lost continuous care, they would be uninsurable. So the protections built into the law allow them to pay reasonable prices. She says:       Would President Trump or any member of Congress who voted      to repeal the ACA be willing to write to my 12 and 9 year old      boys, and explain to them why they let their Mommy die? I      doubt they even give a damn.  I don't think she is right on that. I think that everybody in this Chamber cares about this family, but it is a reminder that there are really personal consequences for millions of Americans if Tom Price, as the leader of the Department of Health and Human Services, leads a campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act without any replacement.  We talked about the damage that will be done to these families, but for the entire marketplace, there is nothing but chaos if Tom Price gets his way. I opposed his nomination right from the start because I knew who he was in the House of I knew that he had led this campaign of health care destruction for families like those that I just described.  Frankly, his hearing just compounded my worries. These ethical lapses that have been raised over and over again just draw even more question as to whether he is going to use this position as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to protect and advance the health care of my constituents or he is going to use that position to enrich himself and his family.  Those are serious accusations. I get it, but these were serious ethical lapses that were uncovered, not by us but by an independent journalist raised as part of these hearings. I would hope this body would consider rejecting Tom Price's nomination so we can find someone to lead that agency and lead our conversation on the floor of the Senate about the future of health care, so that instead of continuing what has been a bitterly divisive issue over the last 6 years, we can finally find a way to come together and answer Angela's concerns that Donald Trump and the Republicans who support him don't care about her and her family, are willing to let her die.  I don't think that is true, but by putting someone in this position as the head of the Department who has campaigned on repealing this act, taking away from Angela the protections that allow her to succeed and to live and to continue to beat cancer, without any idea for what comes next, it suggests that the division will continue and catastrophe will be in line for families like hers.  I will oppose this nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-09-pt1-PgS976-5.txt,1837,HISTORIC PARALLELS,2017.0,9.0,April
4095,topic-id,1318,"Madam President, before I begin, I wish to note my disappointment about how rushed the consideration of this nominee has been. Calls for a thorough investigation into Congressman Price's ethically questionable and potentially illegal health trades have been ignored.  Hundreds of questions HELP Committee Democrats asked Congressman Price as part of the official committee process have gone unanswered, and the vote to advance Congressman Price's nomination to the floor took place without Democrats getting any notice--a clear break from long-standing committee rules. Unfortunately, those are just a few of the examples.  It is clear that Senate Republicans are doing everything they can to protect President Trump's nominees from tough questions, which is only helping him rig his Cabinet against workers and families. That is really concerning, especially on issues as critical as our families' health and well-being.  As I have said before, when I evaluate a nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, I am interested in whether that person has a record of putting people first--not politics, partisanship, or those at the top. I want to know they put science first--not ideology. Critically, I consider whether their plans for health care in our country will help more families lead healthy, fulfilling, and secure lives, or take us backwards.  Unfortunately, I am very concerned that Congressman Price falls far short in these categories and that his nomination sends another clear signal: President Trump is setting up his Cabinet to run our country in a way that benefits those at the top and their allies, but it really hurts the workers and families we all serve.  I will start with women's health and reproductive rights. I believe that when women have access to quality, affordable health care, when they can afford contraception and exercise their constitutionally protected rights to make their own choices about their own bodies, our country is stronger for it. That is because access to health care, which includes reproductive health care, is fundamental to women's economic independence and opportunity. When women have more resources, more freedom, and more ability to give back in whatever way they choose, we move forward as a country.  Congressman Price has a long record of fighting to take women's health care in the wrong direction. He has advocated for defunding Planned Parenthood, our country's largest provider of women's health care, time and again. He has been determined, since the start, to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which has really helped millions of women gain coverage and essential benefits. Especially given his background in medicine, he has displayed a shocking lack of understanding when it comes to the need for continued work to help women access birth control. He even suggested there ``was not one'' woman who couldn't afford contraception.  Well, I have certainly heard the opposite. I know for a fact now that Congressman Price has, too, because I made sure to tell him about my constituent Shannon in our hearing.  Shannon has endometriosis and would have struggled to afford contraception, which is often used to treat that condition, were it not for Planned How can a Secretary of Health and Human Services, who won't listen to stories like Shannon's and who can't understand their need to access basic health care, possibly be trusted to work for all of our communities?  Unfortunately, there is more. While President Trump has magically promised now insurance for everybody that is both lower cost and higher quality, Congressman Price's plans would do the exact opposite. From the start, he has led the fight for repealing the Affordable Care Act, even though Republicans cannot agree on what they as a party would do to replace it.  Congressman Price's own proposals, however, would cause millions of people to lose coverage, increase the cost of care, and leave people with preexisting conditions vulnerable to insurance companies rejecting them or charging them more.  I am hearing constantly from the families who are scared about what the future holds for their health care, given Republicans' rush to rip apart our health care system, and plans like Congressman Price's, which would leave so many so vulnerable, are simply not the answer.  Donald Trump campaigned on promises to protect Medicare and Medicaid, but Congressman Price said that he wants to voucherize Medicare in the first 6 to 8 months of the administration, ending the guarantee of full coverage so many seniors and people with disabilities rely on. He has put forward policies that would shift $1 trillion in Medicaid costs to our States, squeezing their budgets and taking coverage away from struggling children and workers, and people with disabilities, and families.  While President-Elect Trump has said that Medicare should be able to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors, Congressman Price has repeatedly opposed efforts to do so. He even went so far as to call legislation to address high drug prices ``a solution in search of a problem.''  Well, I couldn't disagree more.  In addition, I am deeply concerned about Congressman Price's extreme approach to key public health challenges, including his history of opposing regulations to keep tobacco companies from luring children into addiction.  In fact, it is hard to imagine who in America would be better off under Congressman Price's leadership at HHS--certainly not women who can no longer be charged more than men for the same health care; children or their families who get peace of mind from having coverage through the exchanges or Medicaid; workers who know they can still get coverage, even if they find themselves between jobs; communities that count on public health protection; or seniors who shouldn't have to pay more for prescription drugs or worry about what the future holds for  All in all, Congressman Price's vision for our health care system is, to me, disturbingly at odds with the needs of families I hear from every day. But what makes this nomination even more troubling are the serious ethics questions that have not been resolved as it has been jammed through the I would hope that any Member of Congress--Republican or Democrat--would take seriously the need to ensure that incoming Cabinet Secretaries are free from conflicts of interest, fully prepared to put the public interest first, and have demonstrated a commitment to service for the sake of service, rather than a pattern of mixing personal financial gain with public office. Unfortunately, when it comes to this nomination, Senate Republicans have avoided those questions at every turn.  When reports first came out that Congressman Price had traded more than $300,000 in medical stocks while working on legislation that could impact companies whose stocks he had purchased--including one whose largest shareholder, Representative Chris Collins, encouraged Price to invest in--Democrats called for an investigation before this nomination could move forward. Senate Republicans refused to join us. When outside consumer advocacy groups and an ethics counsel raised concerns, Senate Republicans went ahead with the hearings. The day before a vote on his nomination in committee, when a story broke indicating that Congressman Price misled members of our HELP and Finance Committees in responding to their questions about his investments, Senate Republicans met secretly to jam his nomination through in a closed-door vote.  Congressman Price and Republicans have insisted that everything Congressman Price did was above board and legal. I certainly hope that is the case, but we shouldn't have to take their word for it, and neither should the families and communities we serve. I am deeply disappointed that so many of my Republican colleagues appear to be willing to overlook the need for a thorough independent investigation.[[Page S993]]  Congressman Price's backward views on women's health, his harmful vision for our health care in our country, and the ethical questions that remain unresolved even as this nomination is headed to a vote, I will be voting against Congressman Price for Secretary of Health and Human  Madam President, I yield the floor.

4167,topic-id,747,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize an exceptional public servant, Beth Bell, who is retiring from the directorship of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, NCEZID, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  Bell began her career with the CDC in 1992, in my home State, as an epidemic intelligence service, EIS, officer assigned to the Washington State Department of Health, where she led a seminal investigation into coli infections. After completing her EIS training, she moved to CDC Atlanta to join the hepatitis branch in the division of viral and rickettsial diseases, later serving as chief of the epidemiology branch in the division of viral hepatitis. During her 13 years working on viral hepatitis, she led important efforts to better understand the epidemiology of hepatitis A in the United States, applying this knowledge to the development and implementation of hepatitis A vaccination policy. These extraordinary efforts contributed to reductions in national hepatitis A incidence of more than 95 percent. She also worked on implementation of global infant hepatitis A and B vaccination programs during the early days of the Global Alliance for Vaccines She later served as the acting deputy director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases during the H1N1 influenza pandemic before being appointed director of the newly formed Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, NCEZID, in 2010.  In that role, Bell has been at the forefront of the agency's critical and complex emergency response efforts. In 2014-2015, Bell was called upon to lead the center through the largest Ebola epidemic in history. After reaching a near breaking point where, according to CDC Director Tom Frieden, it was ``spiraling out of control'' in late 2014, the epidemic was contained through the aggressive use of proven outbreak-control measures such as patient isolation and contact tracing.  In 2016, Bell found herself leading the response to yet another pandemic as Zika exploded in South and Central America, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and The impact of Zika on women and children through microcephaly, a life-threatening condition in which children are born with unusually small heads, was heartbreaking and historically significant--never before has a mosquito-borne infection caused such devastating birth defects. CDC's early alert--under Bell's leadership--to people traveling to countries with Zika likely prevented an untold number of infections among women of child-bearing age; and, continuing through her very last day of Federal service, Bell was critical in CDC's support for U.territories, cities, and States--as well as other impacted countries.  In addition, Bell oversaw the Center's response to chikungunya spreading throughout the Americas in 2013-14, the second-largest outbreak of West Nile virus disease in the United States in 2012, and hundreds of outbreaks of foodborne disease. Her leadership of the Center during each of these outbreaks has been remarkable, and all Americans have benefited from her steady hand and commitment to service. Bell also held leadership roles during CDC responses to the 2001 anthrax attacks and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Her outstanding leadership, scientific judgment, and expertise have been critical to the success of the Center in these endeavors.  In 2012, she was called upon to lead the Center's response to the fungal meningitis outbreak associated with contaminated steroid products--America's largest healthcare related outbreak ever. The New York Times called it ``one of the most shocking outbreaks in the annals of American medicine.'' Following her testimony before the Senate HELP committee, Bell was lauded for CDC's prompt and decisive role in the response, which likely prevented many hundreds of infections and deaths among patients who would otherwise have received injections of fungus-contaminated medication.  She also directed two new cross-cutting infectious disease initiatives that have already shown benefits to the field of public health: the Advanced Molecular Detection, AMD, and the Antibiotic Resistance Solutions Initiatives, Together, these initiatives are helping scientists better understand how infections spread and transforming our national capacity to detect, respond, contain, and prevent drug-resistant infections. Because of Bell's leadership, our Nation will be better equipped to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, as well as a myriad of other public health threats.  Bell exemplifies steadfastness and courage in protecting the Nation's health. She has demonstrated an unwavering level of dedication and passion for public health at all levels, recognizing the important roles of State, local, county, tribal, and Federal partners.  Bell has been a true public servant. I ask that we honor Bell today for her invaluable leadership to the CDC and America's public health efforts.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS109.txt,1409,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,5.0,March
4283,topic-id,839,"Thank you, Mr. I thank my colleague from Hawaii for her really important statement on this. I come to the floor today to express my serious concerns, along with other women from the Senate, about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, particularly about what it would mean for women across the country today and for generations to come.  Like the overwhelming majority of my Democratic colleagues, I have decided to vote against Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and I will be opposing a cloture motion ending debate. Now, I don't take this decision lightly, but with the future of women's health and rights and opportunity at risk, it is a decision I must make.  The Trump administration has broken nearly every one of its promises, but one it has certainly kept is its promise to turn back the clock on women's progress. It is clear that Republicans in Congress are committed to doing the same. Last week, just a few days ago, Senate Republicans, with the help of Vice President Pence, overturned a rule that prevents discrimination against family planning providers based on the kinds of services they provide to women. It was shameful and unprecedented.  Now, not missing a beat, Congressional Republicans are already gearing up to attach riders to our coming budget bills in order to cut off access to critical services at Planned Parenthood for millions of patients. There are similar attempts to undermine women's access to healthcare in cities and States nationwide, and more often than we would like, the Supreme Court is going to be the place of last resort for protecting women's hard-fought gains.  If the buck has to stop with the Supreme Court on women's health and rights, I do not want Judge Gorsuch anywhere near the bench. Time and again, Judge Gorsuch has sided with the extreme rightwing and against tens of millions of women and men who believe that in the 21st century, women should be able to make their own choices about their own bodies.  Let me just give you a few examples. When the Tenth Circuit ruled in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that a woman's boss could decide whether or not her insurance would include birth control, Judge Gorsuch did not just agree; he thought the ruling should have gone further. Judge Gorsuch has argued that birth control coverage included in the ACA as an essential part of women's healthcare--one that has, by the way, benefited 55 million women--is a ``clear burden'' on employers that would not long survive.  When it comes to Planned Parenthood, he has already weighed in on the side of defunding our Nation's largest provider of women's healthcare. What was his reasoning? Judge Gorsuch thought that in light of completely discredited sting videos taken by extreme conservatives, women in the State of Utah should have a harder time accessing the care they need. I should note that just last week, the makers of those false videos received 15 felony charges.  I also want to be clear, as well, about what Judge Gorsuch's nomination could mean for a woman's constitutionally protected right to safe, legal[[Page S2199]]abortion services under the historic ruling in Rowe v. Wade, which was just reaffirmed last summer by this In his nomination hearings, Judge Gorsuch would not give a clear answer on whether he would uphold that ruling, which has meant so much to so many women and families over the last four decades.  Judge Gorsuch has donated repeatedly to politicians who are dead set on interfering with women's constitutionally protected healthcare decisions. He has even made deeply inaccurate comparisons between abortion and assisted suicide.  I remember the days before Rowe v. Wade very clearly. I have heard the stories of women faced with truly impossible choices during that time. Women from all across the country have shared those deeply personal experiences because they know what it would mean to go backward.  Lastly, attempts to control women's bodies are not always about reproductive rights. Sure enough, Judge Gorsuch is on the wrong side here as well. He concurred in a ruling against a transgender woman who was denied regular access to hormone therapy while she was in prison. This ruling rejected the idea that under our Constitution, denying healthcare services is cruel and unusual punishment. That is not the kind of judgment I want to see on the bench, and I think most families would agree.  Families who have already done so much to lead the resistance against this administration and its damaging, divisive agenda are fighting this nomination as hard as they can. They know the Trump Presidency will be damaging enough for 4 years, but Judge Gorsuch's nomination will roll back progress for women over a lifetime.  I am proud to stand with them and do everything I can to make sure they are heard loud and clear here in the I oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination in light of everything it would mean for women.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2190-4.txt,1409,IMPROVING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO HIRE AND RETAIN,2017.0,4.0,April
4035,topic-id,510,"Mr.President, I would echo what our chairman, Senator Thune, has said about Elaine She certainly has the qualifications to be our next Secretary of Clearly, she is a part of the Senate family; as the spouse of the majority leader, we know her well--and her government experience as the previous Secretary of Labor and Deputy Secretary of The Office of Government Ethics, which is the independent agency that vets the nominees, has certified that she is in compliance with all the laws and regulations governing conflicts of interest.  This Senator intends to vote for her confirmation, as I did in the committee.  Since the Senator from Arkansas, in his objection to the unanimous consent request of the Democratic leader, made note of the absence of Democratic members from the Finance Committee markup of a couple of the Cabinet nominees, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that indeed, there was new information that came to light overnight in a publication in the Wall Street Journal of additional information about the nominee for the Department of HHS, which needs to be cleared up before the committee proceeds. So I wanted to put that on the record and make clear one of the reasons that the Finance Committee members objected to proceeding.  I think it interesting also that this Senator, as the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, had some additional questions for Secretary Chao--not questions in any kind of defensive or offensive way but additional information. Those questions were proffered Sunday night or early Monday morning. This Senator, not having heard all day from Secretary Chao, called Secretary She promptly returned the call last evening, and, lo and behold, the transition team for the Secretary of Transportation had not even given her the questions.  One of the questions that this Senator had for Secretary Chao was this: Given the chaos in the airports over the weekend, was she as Secretary of Transportation concerned about the orderly administration of those airports when such an unusual order had come down? In addition, what about the lost tickets on getting refunds for passengers and what about the changing of flight crews that might cause extra expenses? These are all items that a Secretary of Transportation would be concerned with going forward. What I found out in conversation was that the nominee to be Secretary of Transportation had not been consulted by the White House--not in advance, during, or after the implementation of those orders having to do with the entry into the United States of refugees and other immigrants.  I think we need Secretary Chao as someone who has the experience, who has common sense, and will be in a position to offer level-headed, good, experienced-based advice to the government going forward. It is just the latest example of some of the fallout from this weekend's activities.  I recommend to our Senators that we approve the nomination of Secretary Chao, and I hope that upon her confirmation today by the Senate, she will be sworn in forthwith.  I yield the floor.

4093,topic-id,1097,"Madam President, I rise in defense of Michigan seniors and working families and to speak on the nomination of Representative Tom Price to be Secretary of Health and Human As a Member of this body, it is my duty to only support a nominee for this position if I trust that he or she will put the health and wellness of American families first.  Representative Price has failed to convince me that he will do this. As a doctor, he should be familiar with the Hippocratic Reciting this oath is a rite of passage for our physicians and our Nation and across the globe. While it is known most widely for its overarching message of ``do no harm,'' I wish to recite a passage from the modern version of the Hippocratic Oath that should resonate with all of us. It reads:       I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart--a      cancerous growth--but a sick human being--whose illness may      affect the person's family and economic stability. My      responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to      care adequately for the sick.  We should all heed these words. Health care is deeply personal. Some of the most important decisions Americans will ever make will be with the advice of their loved ones and their doctor.  Health care affects our families and the economic stability of our families. Quality, affordable health care can literally be the difference between life and death. A Medicare system that works for seniors can be the difference between a retirement with dignity and having to spend their golden years in poverty.  When it comes to our Nation's seniors, Congressman Price has crafted extremely dangerous proposals that would end Medicare as we know it. He has introduced legislation that would turn Medicare into a voucher system, increase the eligibility age for seniors to enroll in the program, and lead to increased drug costs.  Our Nation's seniors worked hard their entire lives and they deserve a dignified retirement--not higher drug costs or a voucher that could be worth less each and every year, putting a significant strain on their fixed budget. We must honor our promises to current and future retirees by refusing to confirm any HHS nominee who is not fully committed to protecting our seniors and ensuring they have the health care they need. We need a Secretary who wakes up every morning thinking about how to provide the best care possible to as many Americans as possible and as affordably as possible.  I am concerned that Representative Price sees our health care system as a profit center, a profit center for special interests and a profit center for himself. He has proposed dangerous plans to end critical investments that make our health care system better so he can give large tax breaks to some of his wealthy friends.  The American people should be confident that the men and women leading Federal agencies are thinking about the bottom line of taxpayers and not themselves. We must be faithful stewards of taxpayer dollars. I wish to remind my colleagues that Medicare and Medicaid spend far less on overhead and operations than private insurance.  I would also like to remind my colleagues that the Republican budget plan that includes repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase our national debt by upward of $9 trillion over the next decade. Yes, that is trillion with a ``t.'' We must continue efforts to cut waste and inefficiencies across the Federal Government, especially in health care. Increasing efficiencies allows us to invest in what works.  Medicare and Social Security are two of the most popular Federal programs ever created, and they are popular for a reason. They work. They work for seniors, they work for the disabled, they work for orphans, and we should too.  When I hear from Representative Price that he wants to fundamentally change Medicare and Medicaid and implement health care reforms that will limit care for American families, this is something I cannot and will never support.  Representative Price has introduced proposals to cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid that will jeopardize care for millions of low-income working Americans, senior citizens that require long-term care in nursing homes and individuals with disabilities. This is not a vision of America that I see, and it is not one I can possibly support.  We need to find a bipartisan path forward. We need to invest in prevention, increased efficiencies, embrace technologies like telemedicine, and capture the full potential of promising medical research, like precision medicine, to yield better care and at lower costs. We need to make it easier for small business owners who want to do right by their employees to provide them with coverage. We can strengthen our health care system without cutting the quality of care by investing in commonsense changes to save money. For example, Medicare spends $1 out of every $3 on diabetes treatment. While the total economic cost of diabetes is estimated to be $245 billion per year, I have[[Page S991]]introduced bipartisan legislation that allows Medicare to enroll individuals at risk for developing diabetes into medical nutrition therapy services proven to decrease the likelihood they will develop diabetes.  I have also introduced bipartisan legislation that expands Medicare's use of telemedicine, increasing access for patients in rural and underserved communities, and bringing down future health care costs by ensuring patients get the preventive care they need to stay healthy.  Instead of focusing on these critical challenges or sensible solutions, Representative Price wants to move us backward and push policies that could leave 30 million Americans without health insurance.  We can't look at this as simple budgetary math, we are talking about 30 million of our friends, family members, and neighbors, including over 800,000 Michiganders--Michiganders who could once again face bankruptcy and loss of their economic security just because they get sick.  We live in a nation where historically the 1 cause of personal bankruptcy has been medical debt. That is simply unacceptable in this great country of ours. Whether we are policymakers or physicians, we should adhere to the central tenet of the Hippocratic Oath of ``do no harm.''  Our Nation's seniors, children, and all hard-working Americans deserve a Secretary of Health and Human Services who will, at the very least, do no harm. Representative Price is not that person.

In San Diego, we are a center of genomics, a center of life sciences, and a center of collaborative scientific research that makes groundbreaking discoveries and improves people's lives. In 2015, our research institutions received $768 million in NIH research funding, the most of any metro area in the United We are home to places like the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, the Craig Venter Institute, and the Scripps Research Institute, where world-class scientists are making discoveries that save and improve millions of lives.  At the University of California San Diego, UCSD, the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center is part of a collaborative national effort to better diagnose, prevent, treat, and ultimately to cure Alzheimer's. More than 5 million Americans are living with that disease. Alzheimer's kills more Americans every year than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. It puts a tremendous burden on the family and the loved ones of those battling the disease because for every Alzheimer's patient, there are three people providing unpaid care.  Thanks to organizations like Alzheimer's San Diego, there are services to support families that are providing care for their loved ones. We are grateful for that, but we need to do more.  Alzheimer's also puts a tremendous burden on our healthcare system, as some of the speakers have mentioned. This year, Alzheimer's and other dementias will cost the Nation $259 billion. As our population ages, those numbers will only go up. It costs on average $1,150 more per month for a senior with Alzheimer's to reside in assisted living. That puts a financial strain on Medicaid, Medicare, and millions of families.  The research being done at UCSD and around the country is fueled by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on The investments we make in basic scientific research to better understand the disease are our best chance at developing new therapies and ultimately a cure.  One of the most bipartisan victories we have had in Congress since I have been here--this is my third term--was to increase NIH funding and to make a $6.3 billion investment in scientific research, which we did last year. Members of both parties came together with the understanding that NIH funding creates high-paying jobs, grows our economy, and unlocks discovery that changes lives. In his joint address to Congress this year, right here in this room, President Trump said he wanted to find cures to ``free the Earth from the miseries of disease.''  Unfortunately, then he turned around and sent a budget to Congress that slashed funding for NIH, clawing back the progress that we made last year. Our efforts to find cures to diseases like Alzheimer's would be completely undermined by the President's budget. We just can't allow that to happen.

What happens is these top scientists from around the world file these grants. They are reviewed not by government employees, not by bureaucrats, not by politicians, but by real scientists, the best in their field, to determine which would win. In the good times, about 25 percent of those grants will be funded by NIH when there is robust funding. Seventy-five percent of them are turned down. That is how selective it is.  Unfortunately, now we are looking at 7 to 10 percent funding. That means we are not discovering a lot. We are also turning a lot of our young people off of science. We can't let that happen.  Again, we could talk about this all day, but I want to turn to my colleagues. Again, I thank Mr.Garamendi for setting up this discussion.

4211,topic-id,1286,"Mr.Speaker, nobody takes the speech and debate clause more seriously in this body than Mr.He speaks in debate pretty much every day, and that is what the Founders wanted us to do, not to just come here in a kind of naked exercise of power politics and see who can get more votes, but really try to learn from each other and engage in a dialogue so we are advancing public policy.  It was a pleasure to receive the gentleman's invitation to join this Special Order on Alzheimer's disease. I am delighted to join him. I am also delighted to see at the dais this evening the Speaker pro tempore, my friend Congressman Smucker from Lancaster County, He is just a freshman, but he is already wielding the gavel. I would say that seat suits Congressman Smucker just fine. It is good to see him up there tonight.  Congressman Garamendi, I am the Congressperson from Montgomery County, Frederick County, and Carroll County, Maryland, the 8th Congressional District, which includes the NIH, the National Institutes of Health; so I have the great fortune and honor and responsibility of representing thousands of people who work at NIH and who live in Rockville and in the neighborhood. So I see this as not just a national treasure and resource, but also a vibrant and vital part of my community that I represent.  I speak tonight not just as a politician, but I speak also as someone who has--I guess what we call around here--a preexisting condition because when I was in the Maryland State senate and as a professor of constitutional law at American University, I was given a diagnosis in the year 2010 of colon cancer.                              {time}  1845  I learned something very interesting going through the experience about the difference between misfortune and injustice. Because if you have a job that[[Page H2509]]you love and a family that you love and constituents that you love and it is a beautiful day and you are told that you have got stage III colon cancer, that is a misfortune. It can happen to anybody--liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, Independent, old, young, every race, every ethnicity. It can happen to anybody. It is a misfortune.  At the time, I was the floor leader in Maryland on marriage equality legislation, and it struck me that the misfortune can happen to anybody. But if you can't get health insurance because you love the wrong person or because you are unemployed or because you are too poor, that is not just a misfortune. That is an injustice because we, as a society, can do something about that.  So when we think about Alzheimer's disease or cystic fibrosis or lung cancer or diabetes 1 or 2, in a democratic society, our obligation is not to compound the misfortunes of life with governmental injustice; our job is to try to reduce misfortune because we are all citizens together.  So that is why I am so proud to represent NIH because, as has been said very eloquently by a number of speakers tonight, the NIH is in the forefront of defending our population against disease and serious illness.  So let's talk about Alzheimer's for a little bit.  More than 5 million Americans are living today with Alzheimer's disease. That is about the population of my State--everybody in Maryland, from Baltimore to Rockville, to Silver Spring, to Bethesda, to Chevy Chase, to Middletown and Frederick County, to Sykesville, all over Carroll County, from the eastern shore to western Maryland, millions of people. That is how many people across the land are suffering from Alzheimer's disease. And it is a number that is rapidly increasing. It could be as high as 16 million people by 2050 is what the experts at NIH are telling us.  Since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer's have increased a startling 89 percent. You have shown us what the graphs are, Mr.One in three senior citizens today dies from Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. For victims of this disease, it is demoralizing, devastating, debilitating, and draining for the whole family.  In Maryland, Alzheimer's affects 100,000 people, and it costs us around $1 billion in Medicaid dollars every year.  In 2017, it is estimated that, across the country, we will spend $259 billion caring for people with Alzheimer's and other kinds of dementia, with $175 billion being borne by Medicare and Medicaid, alone. This means nearly one out of every five Medicare dollars is spent on Alzheimer's.  So we have got to move quickly and effectively to address the crisis and to solve the puzzle of Alzheimer's disease; otherwise, these costs are going to continue to grow even more sharply, and Alzheimer's could overwhelm our healthcare system.  We need a cure, which is why the good people at the Alzheimer's Association are asking Congress to support a $414 million increase in the research budget at NIH for Alzheimer's in FY 2018. But President Trump has proposed a $5.8 billion cut to the NIH, which is a 19 percent reduction in the NIH budget.  Why?  Well, it is very hard to know. It is part of a proposal to slash $60 billion in science research, environmental protection, housing, the human needs budget, and to shift it into the Now, that is at a time, Mr.Garamendi, when a committee I serve on, Oversight and Government Reform, just had hearings where Democrats and Republicans, alike, were outraged to learn that $125 billion in waste, fraud, abuse, and contractor overruns is happening right now in the  We could save $125 billion just by taking seriously the problems in contracting and fraud and abuse that is taking place with the beltway bandits. But instead of going after that corruption and waste, they want to take $60 billion out of the human needs budget and shift it over to the  Well, that is going to have a disastrous effect on our ability to make progress. That is the point I think you are making tonight, Congressman You are saying that, when we invest in basic research on the diseases, we make progress.  Look what we have done with It is amazing. Look what is happening with cystic fibrosis. We are making real progress because we are investing. We have got to not cut back on any of the research that is taking place. We have got to double down and invest, and we really need to do that with Alzheimer's.  So this move to slash the human needs budget, the medical research budget, and put it in the Pentagon is an assault on science, on medicine, and on the health care of our people. These are our people whose lives are at stake that we are talking about. These are our families that are suffering the savage repercussions of Alzheimer's disease. It is a terrible infliction on the land.  So I think that the idea of slashing $6 billion from research for serious diseases like Alzheimer's, like the doomed repeal-and-replace legislation that crashed and burned on Friday of last week, is totally counterproductive and destructive of the true needs and priorities of our people.  We spend more money on the military than the next five or six countries combined, and the Pentagon is swimming in a deep pool of waste, fraud, abuse, and contractor overruns today.  Let's focus on helping our own people right now, the way mature democracies do, not enriching beltway bandits and plutocrats and insiders the way that authoritarian governments do. The question of Alzheimer's is an urgent question for our time, just like the research into all of the other killer diseases that are afflicting our people.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Garamendi for making me part of this Special Order hour.  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2505-6.txt,99999999999999,MONTENEGRO'S ACCESSION INTO NATO,2017.0,28.0,January

4097,topic-id,1168,"Mr.President, I say thank you to my colleague for yielding to me a little bit out of line.  I think one thing we don't do nearly a good enough job at around here--and not just in Washington, DC, but in schools across America--is reflect on the basic civics we have inherited and the constitutional structure of checks and balances and why we have a limited government. I think Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court and, frankly, more narrowly, the media cycles of today, give us a special opportunity to pause and to do a little bit of civics again.  Judge Gorsuch is tough, smart, fairminded, independent, and he is a person who has taken an oath of office to a Constitution of limits. That is exactly the sort of thing we should be affirming and celebrating around here. I think that everyone on both sides of the aisle in this body should be celebrating Judge Gorsuch and what he believes about a constitutional system that has limits. And defending your own branch--the Founders envisioned a world where these three branches would be jealous of their own prerogatives--defending your own branch is not to attack another branch.  As I read the media reports this morning of who said what to whom and who shouted at whom and who argued about what, what if we just paused and reflected again on what it means to believe in a constitution that has three separate but equal branches that are supposed to check and balance one another?  After seeing some media reports this morning, I looked and I happened to have on my desk the breast-pocket card that was in my suit 2 days ago when I met with the judge, and I asked him about the comments coming from the White House criticizing a so-called judge. I wish to share with this body some of the comments the judge made to me when I asked him what he thought about the criticism of the so-called judge, because we don't have so-called judges, we don't have so-called Presidents, and we don't have so-called Senators; we have people from three branches who have taken an oath to a constitution.  So here is some of what the judge told me when I asked him what he thought about those comments. He got a little bit emotional, and he said that any attack or any criticism of his brothers and sisters of the robe is an attack or a criticism on everybody wearing the robe as a judge.  I think that is something this body should be pretty excited to hear someone who has been nominated to the High Court say.  He said that it is incredibly disheartening to hear things that might undermine the credibility and the independence of the judiciary. He said that it is completely legitimate for all of us to vigorously debate individual opinions. We should argue about opinions. We can argue as citizens about cases. We can argue in this legislative branch or the executive branch can argue about the merits of particular opinions and yet we want to affirm the three branches.  So he said it is disheartening for us to do anything that would undermine that.  He then pointed me back to his comments at the White House the night he was nominated, and so I went back and looked at his comments, and the very first people he thanked when he had been nominated to the Court were--he said: I want to celebrate the judges of America who are the ``unsung heroes of the rule of law'' in this country. He called the judges ``unsung heroes of the rule of law.''  He said: An independent judiciary has got to be tough. It is not my job as a nominee to the Court and it is not the job of any other judge to comment on particular cases, and it is not the job of judges to play politics or to hold press conferences talking about politics, but we can recognize that historically the other two branches are often wary of times when the Court asserts its prerogatives.  He said: For instance, Thomas Jefferson didn't like Marbury v. Madison, and it was completely legitimate for President Jefferson to criticize and argue about the merits of the Marbury v. Madison decision even as we do the important civics work of reaffirming these three separate but equal branches.  Frankly, I think that everybody in this body ought to be celebrating the nomination of a guy who is out there affirming three separate but equal branches and the independence of the judiciary. We should want to see the executive branch checked, and, frankly, if we really love America, as I know people in this body do, we should want to see our own powers limited because it is fundamentally American to be skeptical of the consolidation of power.  Our Founders divided power and checked and balanced each of the other branches because they were skeptical of what people in power might ultimately do.  Sadly, there are some on the other side of the aisle today--and I think many are going to give him a fair shake, but there are some on the other side of the aisle who decided they want to reflexively attack Judge So it is like the Keystone Kops trying to run around and figure out which story you want to label him with. I hear some people saying: Well, Gorsuch was nominated by this President and a bunch of people don't like this President; therefore, he couldn't possibly be independent, he would be a puppet. There are other people saying in these private meetings allegedly Gorsuch has rented a plane and taken out a skywriting script and he is out there saying ``I hate Donald I hate Donald Trump.'' That is nonsense. Neither of those things is true. He is not a puppet, and he is not out there attacking the President of the United He is meeting with us, trying to explain his view of an independent judiciary. He is trying to affirm the same constitutional oath of office that all of us in this body have taken.  I think it is high-time in this body that we get beyond reflexive partisanship of ``Republicans are for Republicans if they have the same label'' and ``Democrats are against Republicans''[[Page S995]]and vice versa. Our job fundamentally in this body is an oath that we have taken to three separate but equal branches. I think what we are hearing in these private meetings with Judge Gorsuch and what I am sure he is going to say when he speaks for himself publicly before the Judiciary Committee--what we are hearing from him is a guy who believes in three separate but equal branches and is skeptical of the consolidation of power because he understands why America has limited government.

4072,topic-id,1579,"Mr.President, I thank my friend for his kind words and, most importantly, his distinguished service to his country. Now on to other subjects.      The President, the Travel Ban, and an Independent Judiciary  Mr.President, I rise on a few topics. First, our President has shown a deeply troubling lack of regard for an independent judiciary. He criticizes individual judges in the court system in general. He has gone so far as to preemptively blame future terrorist attacks on the judiciary for putting a stay on his Executive order. I have not heard a President--I can't recall a President in history doing something like that, certainly not in my lifetime.  Let's look at the facts.  Our President all too often seems fact averse. I have experienced that personally, but much more importantly, in general. Not one terrorist attack has been perpetrated on U.soil by a refugee from one of these countries--not one.  Since 1975, 3,024 Americans have been killed on U.soil in terrorist attacks. I know that painfully because some of them are people I knew who died on 9/11 in that awful, vicious, horrible attack that still stays with me every day I wear the flag, this flag on my lapel in memory of those who were lost, and have since 9/12/2001. So I am aware of the danger of terrorists. But of those 3,024 Americans killed, zero of these deaths were the result of an attack by a person from one of the countries listed in the ban. Do you know where I got that information? Not from some liberal publication but from the libertarian-leaning Cato I hope the President is not going to attack them now.  What are the threats of terrorism? The great threats, if you ask the experts, are two things above all: the lone wolves and the visa waiver program. The lone wolves caused the terror recently in both San Bernardino and They were American citizens importuned by the evil ISIS--American citizens who were probably disturbed or off base in a lot of ways. ISIS propaganda got to them, and they acted. Nothing in the President's proposed law would have stopped them, even if it were in effect.  The visa waiver program is the gaping hole. The visa waiver program tells 29 countries that they can send people here without going through extensive checks and background checks. They are mainly countries that are friendly, such as the countries of the But what has happened recently is that those countries have become a place of refuge for terrorists. People trained by ISIS, Belgian citizens, French citizens perpetrated the horrible attacks in those countries. One of those terrorists could, God forbid, get on a plane, come to America with few questions asked. The President's proposal does nothing to stop that. The President's proposal, if anything, encourages lone wolves because it makes them even more outcast. Those are not my words; they are Senator John McCain's words, and he is one of the greatest experts in this body and in this country on terrorism.  If the President wants to do something on terrorism, instead of these back-of-the-envelope, quickly and shabbily put together proposals, he ought to study it, talk to the experts, and certainly close these two loopholes or greatly decrease the danger of terrorism from these two places.  To blame judges for future attacks because they didn't pass this law when not a single American has died because of people coming from these countries and to leave open these other two gaping loopholes--I want to work to close them right now. I will work with the I will work with Senator I will work with our Republican colleagues; we all will on this side of the aisle. But the President put together something that didn't seem to have much thought, didn't seem to have much coordination. Despite the fact that the admirable General Kelly took the lance and said ``I'll take the blame''--we all know that didn't happen. He was not consulted at length nor was his  The President seems to preemptively say: Well, if there is terrorism, blame the judge. It is dangerous for him to say this. It is dangerous because it diverts us from going after the big gaping loopholes of terrorism--lone wolves and the visa waiver program.  It also underscores the fact that we need judges who are going to be independent of this If this President can attack the judiciary the way he does, if this President has so little respect for the rule of law or for separation of powers, our last and best refuge is the courts.  So in my opinion, this new nominee to the Supreme Court has to pass a special test: true independence from the I worry that he doesn't have it. His answers to my questions--I won't go into them today--were disappointing in terms of that independence. You can't just assert ``I am an independent person,'' which he did. You have to show examples. I await them.  When I met him, he said: Well, I am disheartened. He said it to me, he said it to Senator Blumenthal, he said it to Senator To whisper in a closed room, behind closed doors to a Senator ``I am disheartened,'' and not condemn what the President has done to the judiciary and not do it publicly--what he did does not show independence; it shows his ability to desire an appearance of having independence without actually asserting it. There is even more reason to do it now because the President--I don't know how; I don't know who told him about those meetings, but the President tweeted that Judge Gorsuch didn't say those things, as mild as they were and, at least in my opinion, as insufficient as they are to showing independence. To whisper to a Senator but to refuse to say anything publicly is not close to a good enough showing of independence.  From my view, it is not a good start for Judge Gorsuch--not a good start. I haven't made up my mind completely. I am willing to--there is going to be a process. There are going to be papers filed; there are going to be hearings. Judge Gorsuch may go further, but right now it is an uphill fight to get my support.  While this President is attacking everyone under the sun, most of it with no basis in fact, just assertions--and by the way, I will talk about this more later, but if we become a nation where facts don't mean anything, the sun will set on this great country.  We have always been a fact-based country. The Founding Fathers had different views, but they never disagreed on the facts as they debated issues in Philadelphia, for the Declaration, for the In this Chamber, where we have had great Senators--the Clays, the Websters, the Calhouns--they never disputed the real facts. Neither, in my opinion, has any President, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative, until this one, and he just seems to make it up as it goes.  Today he attacked not only my colleague Senator Blumenthal in what I thought was a cheap way, but he attacked John McCain, one of the most respected voices on national security.[[Page S978]]  John McCain voiced his views on what happened in Most of the independent reports corroborate what John McCain said. The President, of course, said it was a great success. I don't know if anyone believes--he is saying so many things that are not fact-based that I don't know if anyone believes him anymore. It would be amusing, except it is not; it is sad, very sad.  It is not the first time he has impugned a Republican He has had harsh words for the Senator from Nebraska, Ben Ben is one of the most independent, thoughtful Senators who I have ever come across on either side of the aisle. I really respect that man. We have spent some time together. We see each other in the gym.  He has attacked the Senator from South Carolina, my friend Lindsey He has attacked the Senator from He has attacked the Senator from Kentucky, the junior Senator from Arizona, and so many others.  I would ask my colleagues, who I know care about this Chamber--and the Senator from Utah's heartfelt plea that we can get over these bumps in the road and start working together is one I feel we share--but are we going to let this new President, who seems to have so little respect for other institutions and people, other than himself, oftentimes; are we going to let him force us to change the rules of this great body? Are we going to let him force us to change the rules of this great body? He immediately demanded a changing of the rules on the Supreme I hope not.  In conclusion, I hope these attacks on an independent judiciary are restrained. I hope my colleagues will join some of us in voicing discontent with those attacks and asking the President to cease and desist. I hope the President himself will stop attacking Senators personally, whether it be the Democratic Senator from Connecticut or the Republican Senator from Arizona--which just happened this morning. I hope we will not let the President intimidate us into changing the way this body works and instead try to come together, not let him divide us.  With that, I yield the floor.

4094,topic-id,1083,"Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to announce I will be voting against Congressman Price to be the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Despite some of the remarks people have expressed, I feel passionately about the fact that he is the wrong person to serve in that job. I have heard from a remarkable number of my constituents who also believe he is the wrong person for the job.  Congressman Price is an outspoken advocate for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which would cause up to 30 million Americans to lose their health insurance and put at risk the lives of thousands of people in New Hampshire and across America who rely on the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare--for treatment of substance abuse disorders. He is a rampant supporter of defunding Planned Parenthood and denying women our reproductive rights. If he defunds Planned Parenthood, it would mean that women would lose access to contraceptive services and cancer screenings.  In New Hampshire we have thousands of women who rely on Planned Parenthood as their only source of health care. Congressman Price is determined to make billions of dollars in cuts to the Medicaid program, which would jeopardize the health of some of our most vulnerable citizens, including millions of children living in poverty and millions of seniors living in nursing home care.  I am especially troubled by the threat that Representative Price poses to women's health. I urge my colleagues to listen to the millions of women across America who marched last month in opposition to the policies of the Trump administration and Congressman Those of us who marched on that day had a simple and powerful message: We will not be dragged backward. We will not allow the Trump administration to take away our constitutional rights and to interfere with our deeply personal health care choices. Yet Price's extreme policies would do exactly that. They would drastically undermine women's access to health care, and they would turn back the clock on women's reproductive health and rights.  Representative Price has spent his entire congressional career authoring, sponsoring, and voting for legislation that would put women's health at risk. He cosponsored and voted 10 times--10--to defund Planned Parenthood, repeatedly championing slashing funding and access for family planning services. If we want to cut down on unintended pregnancies and abortions in this country, we need to give families access to family planning services.  If Congressman Price succeeds in making good on this threat as Secretary of Health and Human Services, it would result in 1.5 million Medicaid patients losing the ability to see the family planning provider of their choice.  As Senator Peters said, Congressman Price does not support the Affordable Care Act and the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that women have access to FDA-approved methods of contraception with no out-of-pocket costs. Indeed, he rejects the very idea that women should obtain birth control with no out-of-pocket costs. He said:       Bring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one.      There's not one.  Well, that statement is not only wrong, but it is arrogant, and it is gravely out of touch with reality.  Throughout his career in Congress, Price has been a zealous advocate of restricting women's access to contraception and abolishing our constitutionally protected reproductive rights. He has cosponsored an ``extreme personhood'' bill--so-called--that would establish that life begins at conception, and he supported a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks, despite the Supreme Court's rulings that similar bills are unconstitutional. He even voted for a bill that would alter the recommended medical training for obstetrics and gynecology by preventing grant funding from being used to train medical students on how to safely perform the abortion procedure.  The policies advocated by Representative Price would have profoundly negative impacts on the health and well-being of the people in my State of New Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would have devastating effects on people in New Some 120,000 Granite Staters--nearly 1 in 10 people in New Hampshire--have enrolled in health care coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, thanks to That is an enormous step forward for the health and well-being of the people of my Yet Price is determined to destroy that progress. Indeed, he seems to have no higher priority than to terminate health coverage for millions of people across this country.  Make no mistake. Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would destroy much of the progress we have made in New Hampshire and in other States to fight the heroin and opioid epidemic. Across this country, more people are now killed by drug overdoses than by traffic accidents. There were more than 52,000 overdose deaths in 2015. But statistics can't fully capture the profound human toll. It is not only the thousands of individual lives that have been destroyed. Entire communities are being devastated.  In dozens of visits to New Hampshire during his campaign, President Trump pledged aggressive action to combat the opioid crisis. Keeping that promise is a matter of life and death. Make no mistake. Representative Price's determination to repeal the Affordable Care Act has put millions of Americans at risk.  I am especially concerned that repeal would abruptly end treatment for thousands of Granite Staters fighting addiction. The Affordable Care Act, and Medicaid expansion in particular--what we call in New Hampshire our New Hampshire Health Protection Plan--which has bipartisan support from then-Governor, now-Senator Maggie Hassan and the Republican legislature, has been a critical tool in combating the opioid epidemic. More than 48,000 Medicaid claims were submitted in New Hampshire for substance use disorder services in 2015.  Having traveled across our State in the past year, visiting treatment centers and meeting with individuals struggling with substance use disorders, I am convinced that Tom Price's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act would mean that thousands of Granite Staters would lose access to treatment, with devastating consequences because right now, even as we are beginning to ramp up treatment, we have the second highest overdose rate in the country.  We need a Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services[[Page S992]]who will respect women's health care choices and our constitutional rights and who will defend the enormous progress we have made, thanks to the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Representative Price is the wrong person for this critically important position in our Federal Government, and I will vote against his confirmation.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-09-pt1-PgS976-5.txt,1901,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,January
4152,topic-id,2011,"Mr.President, I am happy to join my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Cardin, in urging the Senate to approve Montenegro's accession into It is long overdue, as they have both said. This is something that has been approved by the Foreign Relations Committee not once but twice--last year in the last Congress and again in January of this year. We have heard expert testimony from a whole bipartisan group of diplomats, national security experts, and former administration officials, urging quick action on Montenegro's accession. There is no reason for any further delay.  My colleagues here who have been such great leaders on the importance of responding to Russia's actions, of addressing their interference in our elections here in America, but also of addressing what they are doing in Europe, have said it very eloquently. We need to get this done; and 25 of the 28 member states have already ratified the protocol, according to their own procedures. The Senate must act.  One of the priorities of the NATO summit last year in Warsaw was bolstering NATO's resilience and its capacity to deter Russian aggression against NATO's eastern flank. At that summit, NATO invited Montenegro to become its 29th member.  As Senators McCain and Cardin have already said, Russia is opposed to Montenegro's accession into It has warned Montenegro of retaliation if it pursues NATO membership. Furthermore, we have seen what that retaliation looked like.  During Montenegro's general election last October, 20 people were arrested on suspicion of plotting, with support from Russia, to overthrow the government and assassinate the Prime Minister--all because he has supported NATO accession.  When we were in Munich for the security conference a couple of weeks ago, Senator McCain and I and the congressional delegation that was there heard from Montenegrin Prime Minister Djukanovic, who talked about what he experienced from the Russians and about the Russian effort to overthrow his government, a duly elected democracy.  Just last month, their chief special prosecutor announced that his government had evidence that Russia's Federal Security Service was involved in a failed coup.  Mr.President, I have two news articles about this story that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record so that everybody understands that it is very clear what is going on.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From CNN, 21, 2017]             Montenegro: Russia Involved in Attempted Coup                (By Milena Veselinovic and Darran Simon)       Montenegro's chief special prosecutor has told a local TV      station authorities believe Russian security services were      involved in a plot to kill the country's then-prime minister      and overthrow the government last       Milivoje Katnic said Montenegro officials have evidence      that Russia's Federal Security Service was involved in the      failed coup, according to his statements Sunday on Atlas      The allegation drew an immediate rebuke and denial from      Russian officials.       Katnic said the plot was an attempt to stop Montenegro from      joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or      ``Behind these events are nationalist structures from Russia,      but we now know that certain Russian state authorities were      involved also on a certain level,'' Katnic said.       Katnic said the alleged mastermind behind the failed coup      was a man named Eduard Sismakov, who is a former deputy      Russian military attache in Sismakov was deported to      Russia for espionage in 2014, according to the prosecutor.       According to Katnic, Sismakov is also known as Eduard      Shirokov, and was issued a passport with the different name      by Russian authorities.       ``The passport was given to him by certain Russian state      bodies under another name, and he is a member of the Russian      military structures,'' Katnic said. ``And his name is Eduard      Sismakov, that is his personal identity and we will charge      him under that personal identity.''       Katnic added: ``It is clear that the passport could not      have been issued under another name as well as everything      else--sending to Serbia, organizing everything--without the      involvement of certain structures.''       The Interpol Red Notice says Sismakov--listed under the      name Eduard Shirokov--prepared acts against the      constitutional order and security of The Interpol      Red Notice is an international database of suspects that is      shared with other law enforcement agencies. Sismakov's      country of birth is listed as       Katnic said another alleged plotter is Vladimir      Popov, who is of Russian origin, is also wanted by Interpol      for the same acts, according to the Interpol Red       Katnic said another alleged plotter, Nemanja Ristic, was      involved in the coup attempt, and Ristic has said he was      connected to Russia's Federal Security His task was      to recruit a team to send to Montenegro to execute the coup,      Katnic said. Ristic is wanted by Montenegro for attempted      terrorism, according to Interpol's Red       The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Monday dismissed      Katnic's accusations.       ``Day after day, we are faced with absurd accusations about      Day after day we[[Page S1829]]     deny these accusations. We say absolutely that there cannot      be talk about the official involvement of Moscow in the      internal events in Russia does not get involved      and will not get involved especially in such countries as      Montenegro with which we have a very good relationship,''      Peskov said during a conference call with journalists.       Montenegro is in accession talks to join the alliance after      NATO formally invited the southeastern European county in      December 2015. The move spurred threats from Russian      officials, who are at odds with NATO over a multitude of      issues, including Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane in      December 2015.       At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the      incident ``an enemy act.''       Becoming an official member of NATO would be significant      for Montenegro because, under the alliance's charter, any      attack on Montenegro would be seen as an attack on all NATO      members.       The ratification process for Montenegro to join NATO is in      its final stages, according to                                  ____                   [From the Guardian, 11, 2016]     Serbia Deports Russians Suspected of Plotting Montenegro Coup       Serbia has deported a group of Russians suspected of      involvement in a coup plot in neighbouring Montenegro, the      Guardian has learned, in the latest twist in a murky sequence      of events that apparently threatened the lives of two      European prime ministers.       The plotters were allegedly going to dress in police      uniforms to storm the Montenegrin parliament in Podgorica,      shoot the prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, and install a pro-     Moscow party.       The Russian fingerprints on the October plot have      heightened intrigue about Moscow's ambitions in a part of      Europe hitherto thought to be gravitating towards the EU's      orbit.       A group of 20 Serbians and Montenegrins, some of whom had      fought with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine,      were arrested in Podgorica, the Montenegrin capital. In      Serbia, meanwhile, several Russian nationals suspected of      coordinating the plot were caught with =120,000 and special      forces uniforms.       According to a Belgrade daily, the Russians also had      encryption equipment and were able to keep track of      Djukanovic's whereabouts.       Diplomatic sources told the Guardian the Belgrade      government quietly deported the Russians after the      intervention of the head of the Russian security council,      Nikolai Patrushev, who flew to Belgrade on 26 October in an      apparent effort to contain the scandal. The country's      interior minister Nebojsa Stefanovic denied the government      carried out any deportations connected to the plot.       A source close to the Belgrade government said Patrushev, a      former FSB (federal security service) chief, apologised for      what he characterised as a rogue operation that did not have      the Kremlin's sanction. In Moscow, a Security Council      official told Tass that Patrushev ``didn't apologise to      anyone, because there is nothing to apologise for''.       The Serbian government was further rattled three days after      Patrushev's visit when a cache of arms was found near the      home of the prime minister, Aleksandar The weapons      were discovered at a junction where Vucic's car would      normally slow down on his way to the house.       Stefanovic said there were ``strong suspicions'' that an      organised crime gang had been hired to kill Vucic for =10m,      but he would not specify who was behind the alleged plot,      saying further investigation would show whether people      ``outside the region'' were involved.       ``You know the people who don't like a strong Vucic or a      strong government of Serbia and who could contribute some      money, =10m or so, to see this kind of thing done,''      Stefanovic told the       ``We know that the people who were potentially hired to do      this kind of thing were from the region, but not from Serbia,      and that there were crime groups that are operating in the      region that were involved. But these were just the trigger      persons,'' the minister added.       ``We believe that criminal gangs are just being used to do      the job, but the motives are not linked to the gangs. The      assassination of the prime minister is not something that      even they would do lightly, we believe they are being used.''       Since the discovery of the weapons, Vucic has announced      plans to shake up the intelligence service, saying the      security situation was ``even more serious than we      expected.''       ``There will be changes in the secret service,'' he told      the public broadcaster, ``I believed in the skills of      people who didn't show that they have these capacities, but      I'll take responsibility for this.''       It is unclear whether there is a connection between the      alleged assassination plots against Vucic and But      the intrigue of the past month comes against a backdrop of      fierce east-west competition.       Djukanovic has been instrumental in pulling his country to      the verge of NATO membership--an accession protocol was      signed in May--which has dashed Russian hopes of securing a      naval foothold on the According to the Montenegrin      press, Moscow lobbied hard in recent years for transit and      maintenance facilities at the ports of Bar and       The importance of such facilities was demonstrated late      last month when a Russian carrier and its battle group was      denied refueling in European ports along the way to support      the Russian military effort in       In Serbia, Vucic has been seeking a delicate balance      between NATO and Russia, and the country's armed forces have      conducted military exercises with both, although far more      frequently in recent years with Vucic has also refused      to grant diplomatic status to Russian officials staffing a      Serbian-Russian humanitarian center established in the city      of Nis in 2012, infuriating       Western officials suspect the center of being a Trojan      horse, which could expanded as a hub for intelligence and      paramilitary operations in the region. Diplomatic status,      they point out, would have allowed equipment to be brought in      without oversight by Serbian customs.       Some analysts have suggested the operation could have been      mounted as a ``semi-freelance'' one, giving enough distance      from Moscow to be plausibly deniable if was uncovered.       ``Both sides have an interest in playing this as a      freelance, vigilante-type thing, it allows them both to save      face. Whether that's actually true is unclear. There's simply      not enough evidence either to support or disprove it,'' said      Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based analyst.       ``Judging from the amount of logistical and financial      support they got, it looks likely they acted with at least a      tacit understanding that this was sanctioned.''       A few days after the would-be coup, a former intelligence      officer, Leonid Reshetnikov, who ran a hawkish research      institute in Moscow, was relieved of his duties by The      Russian Institute for Strategic Studies has a branch office      in Belgrade, and Reshetnikov had given strong backing to the      anti-Nato opposition party in       A regional analyst who did not want to be named said his      understanding from intelligence sources was that the      incidents in the Balkans were probably linked to Russian      attempts to gain influence and leverage in the Balkans in the      run-up to an anticipated Hillary Clinton US presidency, which      was expected to take a harder line on Russian activity in the      region.       In Moscow, the Russian foreign ministry took a dim view of      this Guardian report on the Balkan events. Maria Zakharova,      spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry wrote: ``The      publication in the Guardian with a link to `sources' saying      that Patrushev apologised for `Russian nationalists' who had      planned to kill the prime minister of Montenegro is a classic      provocation aimed at spreading knowingly false information.''

Look, I think it is critically important that we have a Secretary of the VA to serve our veterans. I think Shulkin is the perfect person for that position. The solutions to the VA's problems should be based on common sense rather than partisanship or an extreme agenda. I think Shulkin recognizes that. He is committed to our Nation's veterans above all. Through the conversations I have had with him over the last year and a half, I think he understands the challenges ahead of us in the  The Choice Program, for example, which has been a wreck by anybody's standards, is looming with dramatic funding shortfalls and is a program we need to work on here in Congress--and we will on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee--to fix, and I think Shulkin is on top of it.  I have many letters from veterans across Montana about how the Choice Program has not worked. It is not that it isn't a good idea. When we passed it, we all agreed that it was a good idea. But it needs to be changed to fix the needs of our veterans and make it more workable.  One other thing is a big problem, and that is the workforce problem we have within the The hiring freeze has made this problem even worse. We all talk about the backlog, and the backlog is real. But we need to make sure the VA has the people they need to serve the veterans in this country, whether reducing that backlog or whether it is making sure they get the care they need.  Finally, and Johnny talked about this: privatization. He has reassured me he will oppose efforts to privatize the Typically, this isn't a problem, but the administration has talked about it extensively. I think it would[[Page S1122]]be a path that is reckless for our veterans, and I think the veterans service organizations would tell us that.  Again, I express my support for the nomination of Shulkin to be VA I believe he will stand up for our veterans. I believe he will put them above politics.  Moving forward, I look forward to working with him and other Members in this body to make sure we serve our veterans the best we possibly can. Our veterans deserve no less.

To no one's surprise, she demonstrated her experience, her thoughtfulness, and her commitment to working collaboratively with Congress on the challenges facing our transportation system.  Last week, the Commerce Committee acted by voice vote to report her nomination favorably to the floor, and I am hopeful that the Senate will confirm her overwhelmingly today.  The agency Secretary Chao has been nominated to lead plays a vital role in facilitating and promoting the safe and efficient movement of goods and people throughout the country and around the world.  Our economy is truly dependent upon a thriving transportation sector. Without a robust and efficient transportation sector, rural States like mine would be unable to get their goods to the market.  Increasing the capacity and the efficiency of our Nation's highways, rail lines, pipelines, and ports is crucial and will have to be a top priority for the next Secretary of  A continued focus on safety must also be a top priority for the next While our Nation's pipelines, railroads, airways, and highways have a strong record of safety, improvements can and should be made. Many of the strong safety improvements the Commerce Committee advanced as part of the FAST Act and the PIPES Act last Congress are yet to be implemented, and we will expect our next Secretary of Transportation to work with us to ensure speedy implementation.  We will also have the opportunity to collaborate on safety improvements when we revisit the authorization of the Federal Aviation Administration later this year. The next Secretary of Transportation will also have a unique opportunity to show Federal leadership in the advancement of transportation innovation.

4286,topic-id,1225,"Mr.President, 2 months ago, the President nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme This week, we will be voting on his confirmation.  I want to say that I am grateful to my colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, for his leadership during this process and for getting this nomination to the floor. We are fortunate to have him as chairman of the Judiciary  We have before us a supremely qualified candidate for the Supreme Judge Gorsuch has a distinguished resume. He is widely regarded as a brilliant and thoughtful jurist. Most importantly, however, he is known for his impartiality and his absolute commitment to the rule of law. Judge Gorsuch understands that the job of a judge is to apply the law as it is written--and here is the fundamental thing--even when he disagrees with it.  ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.'' Judge Gorsuch has said that more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law. That is a problem because there is no such thing as equal protection or equal justice when judges make decisions based on their personal feelings about a case instead of based upon the law. A judge's job is to apply the law as it is written, whether he likes the result or not. Judge Gorsuch understands this.  A lot of people from across the political spectrum have spoken up in favor of Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and one thread that runs through their comments is their confidence that they can trust Judge Gorsuch to apply the law as it is written.  Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help      to restore confidence in the rule of law. His years on the      bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record      that should give the American people confidence that he will      not compromise principle to favor the president who appointed      him.  A former law partner and a friend of Judge Gorsuch's--a friend who describes himself as ``a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes''--had this to say about Judge Gorsuch:       Gorsuch's approach to resolving legal problems as a lawyer      and a judge embodies a reverence for our country's values and      legal system. . . . I have no doubt that I will disagree with      some decisions that Gorsuch might render as a Supreme Court      justice. Yet, my hope is to have justices on the bench such      as Gorsuch . . . who approach cases with fairness and      intellectual rigor and who care about precedent and the      limits of their roles as judges.''  Again, that is from a self-described ``longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes.''  During his years on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has had a number of law clerks. On February 14, every one of Judge Gorsuch's former clerks, except for two who are currently clerking at the Supreme Court, sent a letter on his nomination to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Here is what they had to say:       Our political views span the spectrum . . . but we are      united in our view that Judge Gorsuch is an extraordinary      judge. . . . Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has devoted      himself to the rule of law. . . . As law clerks who have      worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves      a case by the light of his personal view of what the law      should be. Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a      particular result that he desires.       For Judge Gorsuch, a judge's task is not to usurp the      legislature's role; it is to find and apply the law as      written. That conviction, rooted in his respect for the      separation of powers, makes him an exemplary candidate to      serve on the nation's highest court.  Again, that is the unanimous opinion of 39 of Judge Gorsuch's former law clerks whose political views, in their own words, ``span the spectrum.''  Donald Elliott, an adjunct professor at Yale Law School, had this to say about Judge Gorsuch:       Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy isn't mine . . . but      among judicial conservatives, Judge Gorsuch is as good as it      possibly gets. . . . Judge Gorsuch tries very hard to get the      law right. He is not an ideologue, not the kind to always      rule in favor of businesses or against the government.      Instead, he follows the law as best he can wherever it might      lead.  I could go on. The voices raised in support of Judge Gorsuch are numerous.  Unfortunately, no amount of testimony in favor of Judge Gorsuch seems to be enough for Senate Democrats are apparently determined to oppose Judge Gorsuch despite the fact that they are struggling to find any good reason to justify their opposition.  The Senate minority leader came down to the floor on March 23 to announce his determination to vote against Judge Gorsuch, and he urged his colleagues to do the same. Why? Well, apparently the Senate minority leader is not convinced that Judge Gorsuch ``would be a mainstream justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology.'' That is right. Despite the fact that everyone--liberal and conservative--seems to describe fairness as one of Judge Gorsuch's distinguishing characteristics, the Senate minority leader is not convinced the judge will be able to rule without bias. He is worried that Judge Gorsuch won't be a mainstream judge.  Well, over the course of 2,700 cases on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has been in the majority 99 percent of the time--99 percent. In 97 percent of those 2,700 cases, those opinions were unanimous. I would like the minority leader to explain how exactly a judge who is in the majority 99 percent of the time is out of the judicial mainstream. Is the minority leader trying to suggest that all of the judges on the Tenth Circuit, including the ones appointed by Democrats--which, I might add, is a majority on the circuit--are extremists?  The fact is, Democrat opposition to Judge Gorsuch has nothing to do with his qualifications. Let's just get it out there. I doubt that any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really think that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream or that he lacks the qualifications of a Supreme Court No, the truth is that Democrats are opposing Judge Gorsuch because they are mad that it is not a Democratic President making the nomination. They can't accept that they lost the election, so they are going to oppose any nominee, no matter how qualified.  It is extremely disappointing that Democrats plan to upend a nearly 230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court nominees by a simple majority vote simply because they can't accept the results of an election.  Democrats have no plausible reason to offer for opposing this supremely qualified nominee. I hope that a sufficient number of Senate Democrats will think better of their opposition and vote--when we have that opportunity later this week--to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

I concur with him about the basic civics lessons he laid out. I concur with him about three equal branches of government. I concur with him about the fact that I look forward to hearing from Judge Gorsuch and having my chance to view him.  But I would also think that in any kind of objective analysis of what our country is going through right now, we have currently a President of the United States who--I have real questions whether he has read that document, the Constitution, whether he understands the basic tenets of three coequal branches.  We saw his activities during a campaign where he called out a judge because of his ethnic heritage and somehow impugned that judge's independence. At some point, he walked that back, and perhaps those of us who were kind of scratching our heads thought, well, that is just during the campaign, and candidates do strange things during the campaign.  Then we saw the President get elected, and we saw throughout a transition period decrees by twitter that are, again, unprecedented in modern activity. I know the President wants to be a disrupter, but there is some level of comity and some level of civics and some level of recognition of coequal branches that--candidly, when the President of the United States attacks a judge because he doesn't like the ruling in a way that calls into substance not the substance of the ruling but the very nature of the judiciary, I think all of us--and I know the Senator from Nebraska would agree with this--all of us need to sit up and say this is not what the Founders intended.  I look forward to giving Judge Gorsuch and everyone else the President might nominate a fair look, a fair appeal, and then making a judgment on whether I think one of the most important positions--a lifetime position of serving on our Nation's highest Court--whether he is appropriate or not. But this President makes that case harder for his nominee when he shows such blatant disregard of the fundamental basics of our  I would be more than happy and glad if we would all dial it back a bit, but we are in uncharted territory in a way that, as somebody who believes every bit as much in the Constitution as the Presiding Officer does, it makes me very concerned about making sure we maintain those basic liberties, making sure we have a government that can live within its means, making sure we maintain the independence of the judiciary, the independence of our legislative body, and an Executive who knows there are limits on Presidential powers.  I appreciate his comments and particularly appreciate the fact that through his tenure in the Senate, he has shown a level of independence. I have taken some hits from my own team for showing similar levels of independence. I commend his words, but I do hope that those words would actually make their way down to 1600 Pennsylvania I am curious to see what the President's tweeting response to that speech would be.  Mr.President, I did come here, though, today to rise and talk about a need that Virginians and, for that matter, Americans have, about a health care system that is affordable and accessible and provides high-quality health care.  I voted for the Affordable Care Act back in 2010, and I have acknowledged, I think along with many of us, that just like every major reform--just like Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid--Congress never gets it 100 percent right the first time and that Congress needed to revisit and improve certain aspects of the  As anybody who serves in the legislative body knows, you have to have partners in order to get to yes. Unfortunately, that is what we have heard from folks on the other side for the last 7 years. We have heard all the critiques, we have heard the screech of repeal, but we have not heard any kind of plan on what you replace.  The fact is, like it or not, ACA has played a critical role in driving health care innovation, protecting consumers, and reducing overall health care spending. Those are just facts--not alternative facts, not alt acts; those are just facts. The increased coverage to more people now makes it all the more difficult to find some way to repeal and maintain all the things that people liked, yet replace it with a plan that is actually more cost-effective.  So today we consider a candidate for Secretary of Health and Human Services, the lead Cabinet member who will oversee our critical health care programs. Congressman Price has advocated for dismantling the ACA, and he has made it clear that, as Secretary of HHS, he would seek to implement policies that, I believe, will make health care more expensive and less accessible to  Today, after a great deal of reflection, I join my colleagues in opposing Congressman Price's nomination to be Secretary of And rather than going through the statistics and facts--I know I have other colleagues who want to speak--I want to reflect briefly on a couple of stories I have heard from  One of the things that was a benefit but I don't think folks have focused on enough is that the ACA, with all its challenges, did allow people freedom from the trap of being caught in a dead-end job that they couldn't move from because of the fear of losing their health care benefits. This was the first move toward an affordable benefits system, something I think we are going to have to move beyond health care to retirement and other aspects, as well, as more and more workers work not in traditional full-time and long-term employment, but more and more--one-third of the workforce today already is in some form of contingent work: part-time work, independent contractors, gig work. They have no benefits, other than the fact that through the ACA they are able to maintain health care. The ACA has actually reduced this phenomenon of ``job lock.''  A couple of weeks ago, I met Andrea in She always dreamed of opening a software business, but she and her business partner were considered uninsurable because of preexisting conditions. The ACA changed everything. After obtaining insurance through the exchanges, Andrea and her business partner were able to take that risk. Today, that successful company has a staff of 12. As Andrea said: ``Simply put, my business would not exist without the security the Affordable Care Act provided.''  The coverage gains we have seen are remarkable. That is clear from hundreds of Virginians who have contacted me with stories like Andrea's. In fact, never before in our Nation's history has the rate of uninsured dropped below 10 percent. In Virginia, a State where our legislature unfortunately would not expand Medicaid, we have still seen an uninsured rate drop from 15 percent to 9 percent, and 327,000 Virginians got additional coverage. This is especially true in rural areas.  Nationwide, the ACA lowered the percentage of uninsured by eight points in rural communities. Rural communities often struggle with hospitals that, without ACA, would be on the brink of financial extinction.  Here is another quick example from Janet in Mosely, a rural area south of Richmond, who grows and sells organic vegetables to support her family, which includes four children. She said:       We went through various attempts to manage the cost of      health insurance and health care in our finances before the      ACA--with no[[Page S996]]     good results. [Because of ACA], we have been able to have an      appropriate plan, with a realistic deductible, access to      quality doctors, and be able to go to preventative care      annual appointments. We are quite fearful about what life and      business may be like without the ACA, or an improved-upon      version of the A repeal would be disastrous.  Unfortunately, not only has Congressman Price strongly opposed the ACA, but his plan--or what framework of a plan you see--and other proposals dramatically scale back the individual market reforms that allow people like Andrea and Janet to obtain meaningful coverage. As our workforce becomes more mobile than ever, Congressman Price has said people should have access to care, but access to care without affordable care isn't true access.  For example, if you got rid of the ACA with no plan to replace it, we would see the reinstatement of lifetime and annual limits on coverage. They are what turned getting sick into a financial calamity for so many people. Plans would be required to cover far less in terms of conditions, moving away from the ACA's promise that insurance is worth more than the paper it is written on.  As I mentioned already, the close to one-third of the workforce that is already in some level of nontraditional work and doesn't work full time in a long-term employment facility would lose that flexibility to move from job to job.  We have also heard from Congressman Price plans to block-grant, for example, We in Virginia have a very trim Medicaid program. We have also not expanded Medicare, which I think was a grave mistake of the legislature. The Governor and I agreed we should expand it. Putting a Block Grant Program in place for Virginia would be a disaster in terms of As well, Congressman Price has voted against the Children's Health Insurance Program, the CHIP program, one of the things I was proud to expand in Virginia, where we ended up signing up 98 percent of all eligible children. Congressman Price called the CHIP program ``government-run socialized medicine.'' What he didn't say is what he would say to the 200,000-plus kids in Virginia who get their health care coverage through  So I believe that Congressman Price's approach--whether it is on Medicaid block-granting, whether it is on the ACA, whether it is on the CHIP program, whether it is his failure to come up with a sufficient plan to provide access and affordability--means that if we go forward with his nomination, the kind of chaos that would be created if you repeal the ACA without a replacement plan in place will not only affect the 20 million-plus Americans who got health care coverage through the ACA but literally everyone else because it will absolutely pull the bottom out of the overall insurance market. These are chances that we can't take.  I have a series of other stories, but I see my friend the Senator from Connecticut, who spent a great deal of time on this issue back when there weren't that many people coming to the floor to defend the I guess it is better to be early and right, but Congressman Murphy has been a great leader on this issue. He was here, as I mentioned, on the floor, when many of us were active in other activities, an absolute native of the ACA, when we went through the bad rollout. But what we have seen in America, as we get closer now to the reality of the new administration, is that the new majority wants to actually repeal this program without fixing it--simply repeal. I think his forewarnings about what would happen are all coming to pass.  I will personally be opposing the nomination of Congressman Price to be Secretary of I hope my colleagues will join me.

I, too, share the belief that there was a better way to go about this judicial nomination process. I think as well that traditions such as a 60-vote margin should be maintained.  I think, frankly, neither party comes to this issue completely with clean hands, with the Democrats' action in 2013. But clearly our colleagues' actions of not even giving someone of such character as Merrick Garland the courtesy of meetings, a hearing, and then an up-or-down vote--for that and for many other reasons, I will be joining my friend from New Jersey in voting against Judge Gorsuch and making sure that we use all of our available tools. So I thank him for those comments.                      Tribute to Federal Employees      Kirk Yeager, Dennis Wagner, Edward Grace, and Mariela Melero  Mr.President, that sense of what we are dealing with now in our politics today is the subject that I want to speak about for a few minutes; that is, the incredibly important efforts made each and every day by our public servants.  We often forget that our public servants, our Federal employees, go to work every day with the sole mission to make the country a better and safer place. Day after day they go to work, receiving little recognition for the great work they do. Since 2010, I have come to the Senate floor to honor exemplary Federal employees--a tradition that was begun by my friend Senator Ted One of those Federal employees is actually sitting at the desk and has helped me and I know so many other Senators as we have tried to learn this job.  The reason I wanted to come back today was because today, in light of a governmentwide hiring freeze, the reinstatement of the so-called Holman rule, a proposed budget that would deeply cut our Federal workforce, and candidly, in these times, the targeting of career civil servants by certain conservative media outlets, this tradition of honoring those who serve, oftentimes without recognition, our Federal employees, feels even more important.  Our Federal employees--over 170,000 of them Virginians--serve their country dutifully regardless of the party in power. Not only do they carry out the mission of the administration they are serving, but they also provide countless benefits to the American public. It is my hope that my colleagues and the current administration will remember these facts and set aside ideology when considering actions that affect our Federal agencies and their workforce.  Today I want to take a couple of moments to recognize a few Virginians who are working behind the scenes to actually make our government more efficient and more effective.  First, I would like to recognize Kirk Kirk is the Chief Explosives Scientist at the In this role, he both responds to crises and oversees the Bureau's efforts to better understand the explosives terrorists use. Having studied bomb-making for more than 20 years, Kirk works with both domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies and has developed and provided crucial training to every bomb squad in the United States and to many of our foreign allies. Through his work, Kirk has made U.civilian law enforcement personnel and those who serve our country in the military much safer.  Next, I would like to recognize Dennis Dennis is the Director of the Quality Improvement and Innovation Group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid As part of a team at CMS, Dennis contributed to the creation of the Partnership for Patients, a public-private partnership to increase patient safety and reduce readmissions to U.hospitals. Their work has produced outstanding results, including 2.1 million fewer patients harmed and $20 billion saved. That is a remarkable statistic, and obviously the work going on at CMS--an agency that does not get a lot of recognition; candidly, most people don't even know--a person like this gentleman, Dennis, has made our healthcare system better.  Third, I would like to recognize Edward Edward is the Deputy Chief in the Office of Law Enforcement at the U.Fish and Wildlife In that role, Edward has been leading a nationwide law enforcement investigation known as Operation Crash, targeting those who smuggle and trade rhino horns and elephant ivory. In addition to assisting in the Department's efforts to preserve global biodiversity, Operation Crash has led to 41 arrests, 30 convictions, and the seizure of millions of dollars in smuggled goods--results that show that those seeking to engage in this kind of activity--there will be real legal consequences to their actions.  Finally, I would like to recognize Mariela Mariela is the Associate Director for the Customer Service and Public Engagement Directorate at the U.Citizenship and Immigration Mariela and her team have been working to improve the way USCIS interacts with the millions of people who contact their office seeking citizenship, permanent residency, refugee status, or other assistance. Central to that mission are the innovative improvements Mariela has made to the myUSCIS website, as well as the launch of Emma, a virtual assistant that in a typical month answers nearly[[Page S2209]]500,000 questions with a success rate of nearly 90 percent.  To ensure that this resource was available to a wide range of customers, Mariela also oversaw the creation of a Spanish-speaking Emma that came online in 2016. These important improvements have been crucial to driving efficiency for the world's largest immigration system in the world.  Again, I hope my colleagues--as we think about budgets and numbers and when we hear people who oftentimes denigrate our Federal employees--will remember some of these individuals who, not for great reward or recognition, actually get up each and every day and go to work, trying to ensure that our government functions for the hundreds of millions of Americans who oftentimes don't acknowledge or recognize their services enough.  Mr.President, as I mentioned at the outset, I know this is a time when most of my colleagues are speaking on Judge I will simply add, after a careful review of his record and my belief as well, that his unwillingness to really give truly straight answers in terms of comments--whether it was basic, decided legal opinions like Brown v. Board of Education or Roe v. Wade or Citizens United--and his failure to even answer those questions has unfortunately led me to join with so many of my other colleagues in voting against him.  I still hope that there is a way that we can avoid changing the rules of the Senate during this process. I know there are many colleagues who are working on those efforts. If they are successful, I look forward to joining them.  As we think about Judge Gorsuch, as we recognize the challenges we have ahead of us, let us also--those of us who serve in this body--continue to take a moment every day to say thanks to a Federal employee who, in one way or another, works tirelessly day in and day out to make our country a better place.

Here is a news flash: If you have to hide your plans from the American public, that is a pretty good sign that you are headed in the wrong direction.  Now we know why they were so afraid to let anyone else take a look at the plan. The plan is ugly--really, really, ugly. The Republicans' plan would rip health insurance away from millions of  Right off the top, the bill will end the Medicaid expansion established in the Right now, 11 million adults are covered by that expansion, and the Republican plan will end it. That is right--end it. Millions more Americans are using ACA subsidies to buy their health insurance. For the families who need it most, those subsidies will be cut. For seniors, prices will rise, and that means millions more people will not be able to afford health insurance.  The Republican bill promises tax credits to help people pay for their insurance, but this is an empty promise because the tax credits are designed to be too small to actually cover the costs of paying for healthcare. If you have a 2-month break in your health insurance coverage, no matter the reason, the Republican bill would let insurance companies charge you a 30-percent penalty on top of your premium for an entire year. That is right. If you lose your job and scramble to find a new plan, you have exactly 62 days to lock down that plan because 1 day longer than that, and you are slapped with a 30-percent penalty.  By the way, it is not a penalty paid to the government to help finance healthcare. It is a penalty paid to a $1 billion insurance company. Republicans should be ashamed of themselves.  Too bad if being able to buy affordable coverage on the ACA exchange has given you access to health insurance while you start your small business. Too bad if your healthcare has given you free cancer screening. Too bad if your healthcare has given you access to treatment for substance abuse disorder. All that is gone under the Republican plan.  So there it is--the Republicans' plan to take away health insurance for millions and millions of The Republican plan is cruel, and it gets worse.  The Republican healthcare plan gets worse because it also delivers a gut punch to the rest of the Medicaid Program--the part that predates the ACA by decades. It does so by putting a cap on overall funding that States can receive and then strictly limiting the growth in that cap. This growth rate is deliberately set lower than the actual growth rate in medical costs for Medicaid beneficiaries. Why? So Republicans can cut the Federal Government's commitment to Medicaid without using the word ``cut.''  I don't know if they think we are just too dumb to notice, but they are cutting Of course, people will still get sick and will still need medical care, so what the Republicans are doing is shifting hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid costs to State governments, which will struggle to pick up the tab, or shifting those costs to hospitals and doctors, who will not get paid, or shifting it to the families themselves, who will try to manage those bills.  Understand what that means. Right now, if you qualify for Medicaid coverage, you get Medicaid coverage. That has been the law for decades, but the Republicans want to change that. With the cap, if you qualify for Medicaid coverage, you will get something. Nobody is really sure what. All we know is that it will not cover your expected costs of care. Think about the impact of that.  The reckless Republican plan will blow huge holes in State budgets. The Republican plan will blow huge holes in rural hospitals' budgets and in the budgets of opioid treatment centers and community health centers all across this country.  Massachusetts is using some of its Medicaid funding right now to fight the opioid crisis, but the Republican plan makes it harder to wage that fight in Massachusetts and in every other State that is battling this terrible epidemic.  The Republican plan will leave millions of people who have decent Medicaid coverage holding the bag when they get sick. That is not healthcare; that is a con job.  But it gets even worse. The bill cuts funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides maternity care and birth control. It gives insurance companies the green light to jack up costs for people over 50, blowing up the limits that were established in the ACA to make sure seniors could afford healthcare.  But there is one more very, very ugly reason the Republicans should be ashamed, and that is because while they are gutting Medicaid, slashing health coverage for sick Americans, and slapping penalties on people who lose insurance through no fault of their own, Republicans are also handing out hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts to rich people and giving a special gift to insurance company  The Republican plan repeals two Medicare taxes that apply only to high-income taxpayers. Who benefits most from this repeal? They get a full 80-percent of the tax cut. It is a benefit that is worth an average of $50,000 each. That is right. The tax cut that millionaires will get from the Republican plan to rip up healthcare is more than many families make in a year.  The Republican plan also hurts Medicare by taking money away from the Medicare trust fund, where it really belongs.  Right now, the law says insurance companies can deduct only $500,000 in executive compensation, but the Republicans think that is too hard on insurance companies and their So sad. So they have lifted the cap to a full $1 million. The Republicans are determined to help boost the pay of insurance company No wonder the Republicans didn't want to let anyone see this plan.  This is literally a backroom deal to strip away lifesaving healthcare from babies, to drive the costs out of sight for seniors, to deny help for people with disabilities, and to make insurance more expensive for hard-working entrepreneurs. In exchange, insurance company CEOs and millionaires get giant tax deductions. Less health insurance for people who need it; more tax cuts for wealthy insurance company This is the deal it took Republicans years to come up with? They should be ashamed.  I have received letters and emails and calls from families in Massachusetts who depend on Medicaid and the These families are shouting as loudly as they can about how important Medicaid and the ACA are to them. We need someone running the CMS who is listening and someone who has their backs, who will tell Republican politicians that their secret deals are terrible, who will tell them that their plans to take away coverage will hurt people, who will tell them that their recklessness will blow up State budgets.  Seema Verma has a deep knowledge of the Medicaid Program, having worked at the State level to design and implement Medicaid waivers.

4281,topic-id,1088,"Thank you to the Senator from Hawaii for calling us here together today.  Mr.President, it is clear that President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, does not have enough support in the Senate to be confirmed under our rules. When a Supreme Court nominee does not have enough support to be confirmed, the solution is to pick a new nominee, but Republicans in the Senate are threatening to pursue a different path. They are considering breaking the Senate rules to force the nominee onto the Supreme Court anyway.  I will be honest. I think it is crazy that we are considering confirming a lifetime Trump nominee to the Supreme Court at a moment when the President's campaign is under the cloud of an active, ongoing FBI counterintelligence investigation that could result in indictments and appeals, that will go all the way to the Supreme Court, so that Trump's nominee could be the deciding vote on whether Trump or his supporters broke the law and will be held accountable. That is nuts. I believe we should tap the brakes on any nominee until this investigation is concluded.  But even if none of that were happening, I would still oppose the confirmation of Neil My objection is based on Judge Gorsuch's record, which I have reviewed in detail. Judge Gorsuch's nomination is the latest step in a long political campaign by rightwing groups and their billionaire backers to capture our courts.  Over the last 30 years, as the rich have gotten richer and working families have struggled to make ends meet, the scales of justice have been weighted further and further in favor of the wealthy and the powerful. Those powerful interests have invested vast sums of money into reshaping the judiciary, and their investment has paid off in spades. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it easier for corporate giants that cheat their customers to avoid responsibility. Recent Supreme Court decisions have let those same corporations and their billionaire investors spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections and manipulate the political process. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it easier for businesses to abuse and discriminate against their workers.  Giant corporations and rightwing groups have notched a lot of big wins in the Supreme Court lately, but they know their luck depends on two things--first, stacking the courts with their allies, and second, stopping the confirmation of judges who don't sufficiently cater to their interests. That is part of the reason they launched an all-out attack on fair-minded mainstream judges--judges like Merrick Garland, a thoughtful, intelligent, fair judge to fill the open vacancy on the Supreme  These very same corporate and rightwing groups handed Donald Trump a list of acceptable people to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, and as a Presidential candidate, he promised to pick a Justice from their list. Who made it onto that rightwing list? People who, unlike Judge Garland, displayed a sufficient allegiance to their corporate and rightwing interests. Judge Gorsuch was on that list, and his nomination is their reward.  Even before he became a Federal judge, Judge Gorsuch fully embraced rightwing, pro-corporate views. He argued that it should be harder, not easier, for shareholders who got cheated to bring fraud cases to court.  On the bench, Judge Gorsuch's extreme views meant giant corporations could run over their workers. In Hobby Lobby, when he had to choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of women, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. In consumer protection cases, when he had to choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of the consumers they cheated, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. In discrimination cases, when he had to choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of employees who had been discriminated against, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. Time after time, in case after case, Judge Gorsuch showed a remarkable talent for creatively interpreting the law in ways that benefited large corporations and that harmed working Americans, women, children, and consumers.  When it comes to the rules that prevent giant corporations from polluting our air and our water, from poisoning our food, from cheating hard-working families, Judge Gorsuch believes that it should be easier, not harder, for judges to overturn those rules--a view that is even more extreme than that of the late Justice  Republicans assert that Judge Gorsuch is a fair, mainstream judge, but rightwing groups and their wealthy, anonymous funders picked him for one reason: because they know he will be their ally. And that is not how our court system is supposed to work. Judges should be neutral arbiters, dispensing equal justice under law. They should not be people handpicked by wealthy insiders and giant corporations.  For the working families struggling to make ends meet, for people desperately in need of healthcare, for everyone fighting for their right to vote, for disabled students fighting for access to a quality education, for anyone who cares about our justice system, there is only one question that should guide us in evaluating a nominee to sit on any court: whether that person will defend equal justice for every single one of us. Judge Gorsuch's record answers that question with a loud no.  Republicans have a choice. They can tell President Trump to send a new nominee--a mainstream nominee who can earn broad support--or they can jam through this nominee. If they do jam through Judge Gorsuch, the Republicans will own the Gorsuch Court and every extreme 5-to-4 decision that comes out of it. Republicans will own every attack on a woman's right to choose, on voting rights, on LGBTQ rights, on secret spending in our political system, and on freedom of speech and religion. Republicans will be responsible for every 5-to-4 decision that[[Page S2198]]throws millions of Americans under the bus in order to favor the powerful, moneyed few who helped put Judge Gorsuch on the bench.  Right now, the Presidency is in the hands of someone who has shown contempt for our Constitution, contempt for our independent judiciary, contempt for our free press, and contempt for our moral, democratic principles. If ever we needed a strong, independent Supreme Court with broad public support--a Supreme Court that will stand up for the Constitution--it is now.  If ever there were a time to say that our courts should not be handed over to the highest bidder, it is now. And that is why Judge Gorsuch should not be confirmed to sit on the Supreme Court of the United  I yield the floor.
