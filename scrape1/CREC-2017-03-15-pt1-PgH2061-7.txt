                        HONORING GEORGE COCHRAN

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor George ``Boogie'' 
Cochran, Jr., who passed away peacefully at the age of 89 on March 1.
  Mr. Speaker, Chief Cochran lived a life in full, one of family and of 
service.
  As a 17-year-old Leon High School student, he enlisted in the Navy in 
1944. He served bravely aboard Navy destroyers in the Pacific 
campaigns. He participated in America's nuclear weapons testing after 
the war, and in the action surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis.
  In 1963, in recognition of his dedicated and courageous service in 
the Navy, Chief Cochran was awarded the first annual Commander Ernest 
Evans Memorial Award aboard the USS Johnston.
  He loved his family, his country, and his community. He represents 
the best of America.
  Boogie, you will be missed by many, and may you rest in peace.
