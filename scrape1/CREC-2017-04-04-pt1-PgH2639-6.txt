 INDEPENDENT COMMISSION NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE TRUMP'S TIES WITH RUSSIA

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Republicans are now joining Democrats in 
calling for Chairman Nunes to recuse himself from the House 
Intelligence Committee's current investigation into Russia's 
interference in the 2016 election.

[[Page H2640]]

  By working hand in glove with the White House around an investigation 
that centers on the President and his administration, the chairman has 
blown the integrity of this investigation. Through his actions, he has 
shown he cannot lead an impartial investigation. His actions 
demonstrate why Congress must establish a bipartisan, independent 
commission to investigate President Trump's political and personal 
business ties to Russia.
  The majority of the American people favor an independent commission, 
outside of Congress, according to polling done by the Associated Press. 
This is a serious matter. Our democracy is at stake. Our national 
security is at stake.
  Congress must call a bipartisan, independent commission to 
investigate these troubling connections between President Trump and 
Russia.
