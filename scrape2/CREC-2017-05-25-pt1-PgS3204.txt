  RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE WASHINGTON NATIONAL OPERA

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my wife Marcelle and I know and respect 
Jacqueline Mars. She joined the Washington National Opera's board of 
trustees in 2003. She was elected as chairman of the board of the 
Washington National Opera in 2011 and oversaw WNO's affiliation with 
the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Some of the 
highlights during her tenure as chair have been the acclaimed 
production of American Ring--The Ring of the Nibelung; M&M's Opera in 
the Outfield; the Holiday Family Opera; and the American Opera 
Initiative. Marcelle tells me that, in recognition and appreciation of 
all of her tireless efforts and enormous contribution and support of 
the Washington National Opera, the Board of Trustees of the Washington 
National Opera have unanimously approved that Jacqueline Mars will now 
be recognized as chairman of the board of trustees emeritus of the 
Washington National Opera.
  I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be printer in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

  Resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Washington National Opera

       The Board of Trustees of the Washington National Opera (the 
     ``Board'') does hereby adopt the following resolutions:
       Whereas, the Board recognizes the extraordinary 
     achievements of Jacqueline Badger Mars as Trustee and 
     Chairman of the Washington National Opera;
       Whereas, in her years as Chairman, Jacqueline Badger Mars 
     has provided wise, far-sighted, and creative leadership in 
     guiding the Washington National Opera from the challenges it 
     faced in effectuating its historic affiliation with the John 
     F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, through its 
     successful and acclaimed production of Wagner's Der Ring des 
     Nibelungen cycle of operas--perhaps the most ambitious 
     project that can be undertaken in the opera world, to its 
     commissioning and introduction of new works by new composers 
     and librettists as part of the American Opera Initiative;
       Whereas, Jacqueline Badger Mars's service as Chairman has 
     included numerous other highlights and accomplishments; and
       Whereas, the Board wishes to recognize its deep 
     appreciation to Jacqueline Badger Mars for her untiring 
     efforts and enormous contribution to and support of the 
     Washington National Opera and the operatic art form 
     generally, and for her friendship over the years, now, 
     therefore, be it:
       Resolved, That Jacqueline Badger Mars shall hereinafter be 
     recognized as Chairman of the Board of Trustees Emeritus of 
     the Washington National Opera; and further
       Resolved, That this resolution shall be effective May 15, 
     2017.
