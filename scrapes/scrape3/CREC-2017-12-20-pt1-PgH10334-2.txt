   CONGRATULATING AMSTERDAM RADIO LEGEND SAM ZURLO ON HIS RETIREMENT

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Amsterdam radio 
legend, Sam Zurlo, on his retirement this week.
  For over 60 years, Sam's voice has greeted the residents and visitors 
of Montgomery County, New York. Sam has been working in broadcasting 
since 1953. Now at 82, he hosts the longest-running talk show in the 
history of the county.
  Sam's broadcasting career was born from his service with Armed Forces 
Radio in Germany, where he delivered a nightly broadcast for 3 years. 
Sam also worked as a print journalist for the Schenectady Gazette for 
some 35 years.
  Decade after decade, his distinctive voice has been the catalyst for 
free and open debate. He has brought an air of familiarity and of 
community to our humble corner of upstate New York. Listening to 
conversations about current events with Sam has always made the 
abstractions of politics a little more real. Sam's personality has 
inspired many and brought light, comfort, and connection to countless 
neighbors and friends.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Sam Zurlo for his years of exceptional work and 
a legendary career in local journalism. I wish him the best for an 
equally special retirement.
