      SENATE RESOLUTION 378--CONGRATULATING THE NATIONAL TREASURY 
      EMPLOYEES UNION ON ITS 80TH ANNIVERSARY AND COMMENDING THE 
      DEDICATION TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES OF AND CONTINUED SERVICE BY 
     THE NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION AND THE MEMBERS OF THE 
                   NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION

  Ms. BALDWIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:

                              S. Res. 378

       Whereas, in 1938, a group of employees in Wisconsin banded 
     together to eliminate political influence in the jobs of 
     those employees as revenue collectors, marking the beginning 
     of the National Treasury Employees Union (referred to in this 
     preamble as the ``NTEU'');
       Whereas that group persisted for 14 years and finally won 
     civil service protections, leading to the establishment of 
     the professional workforce at the Internal Revenue Service 
     that exists today;
       Whereas, in 1972, the NTEU signed the first negotiated 
     bargaining agreement of the NTEU, which developed a shared 
     set of responsibilities for managers and bargaining unit 
     employees that were designed to improve the workforce and 
     achieve the mission of the Internal Revenue Service;
       Whereas, since that initial agreement, the NTEU has 
     promoted new and innovative workplace policies that benefit 
     Federal employees and agencies, such as alternative work 
     schedules and telework policies;
       Whereas the NTEU--
       (1) serves as a powerful voice for the members of the NTEU 
     and for Federal employees in general;
       (2) has successfully sought to promote and defend Federal 
     service as a noble calling involving a variety of challenging 
     and rewarding professions; and
       (3) has fought tirelessly to ensure that Federal employees 
     are free from discrimination, politicization, and retaliation 
     for disclosing Government waste, fraud, and abuse;
       Whereas the work of the NTEU and the knowledge and skills 
     of the highly trained individuals represented by the NTEU who 
     work for the Federal Government contribute significantly to 
     the greatness and prosperity of the United States;
       Whereas the NTEU has grown to represent more than 150,000 
     employees from 32 different Government agencies, and the 
     members of the NTEU--
       (1) collect the money to fund the Government;
       (2) help protect the borders of the United States;
       (3) ensure that individuals in the United States have clean 
     air and water;
       (4) regulate financial services companies; and
       (5) make sure that the manner in which the airways are used 
     is in the public interest;
       Whereas the mission of the NTEU, to help create workplaces 
     in which every Federal employee is treated with dignity and 
     respect, has been met by the efforts of the NTEU to--
       (1) advocate for fair pay and benefits;
       (2) negotiate for work-life balance initiatives; and
       (3) ensure a merit-based, nonpartisan civil service;
       Whereas, whether advocating on Capitol Hill, at the 
     bargaining table, or in workplaces across the United States, 
     the NTEU continues to make history through its 
     accomplishments; and
       Whereas, in 2018, the NTEU is celebrating its 80th 
     anniversary: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) congratulates the National Treasury Employees Union on 
     its 80th anniversary; and
       (2) commends--
       (A) the work of the National Treasury Employees Union; and
       (B) the members of the National Treasury Employees Union 
     for their outstanding contributions to the United States.
