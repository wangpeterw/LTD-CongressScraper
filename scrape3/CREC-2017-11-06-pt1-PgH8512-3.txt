 RECOGNIZING RICHARD SYNEK, U.S. NAVY VETERAN AND FOUNDER OF FEED OUR 
                                VETERANS

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Richard Synek, 
a veteran of the United States Navy and founder of Feed Our Vets.
  Rich served in the Navy during the 1980s and was serving aboard the 
USS Peterson during combat operations against Libya in 1986.
  After his military service, Rich worked for the United States Postal 
Service, serving as postmaster for several local post offices. During 
his time as postmaster of the Vernon Center Post Office, Rich 
encountered a World War II veteran who could only afford to buy one 
stamp and food for half the month.
  After befriending this veteran, Rich bought him groceries so he and 
his wife could eat. Shortly after, Feed Our Veterans was formed.
  Since 2008, Feed Our Veterans has served over 20,000 veterans and 
their families, providing over 445,000 pounds of food for those in 
need.
  Our community is grateful to Rich for his service in the Navy, but 
especially for his continued compassionate service to our fellow 
veterans.
