      CONGRATULATING RUTGERS SCARLET KNIGHTS MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Rutgers 
men's basketball team on a tremendous accomplishment.
  With their win last night over The Ohio State University, the Scarlet 
Knights celebrated their first Big Ten Tournament victory since joining 
the conference in 2014. Their hard work this season has paid off, and 
they now advance to play Northwestern tonight.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the team, first-year head 
coach Steve Pikiell, and the entire Rutgers program.
  Following their win, Coach Pikiell said that the team learned how to 
compete this year. Well, last night it certainly showed, and I look 
forward to watching the Scarlet Knights play tonight and wish them 
continued success in the tournament.
