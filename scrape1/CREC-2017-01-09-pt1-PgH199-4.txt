                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another year.
  At the beginning of this new day, we are grateful as individuals and 
as a nation for all the blessings we have been given.
  We ask Your blessing upon the Members of this people's House as they 
reconvene for this first session. May they anticipate the opportunities 
and difficulties that are before them, and before so many Americans, 
with steadfast determination to work together toward solutions that 
will benefit their countrymen. Grant that they be worthy of the 
responsibilities they have been given by their constituents and truly 
be the people You have called them to be.
  May Your Spirit, O God, be in all of our hearts and minds and 
encourage us to do the works of peace and justice now and always.
  May all that we do be done for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
