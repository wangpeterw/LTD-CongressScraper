             RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following 
resignation from the House of Representatives:

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2018.
     Hon. Paul Ryan,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Ryan: It has been an honor and privilege to 
     serve the people of Texas' 27th Congressional District as 
     their representative in Congress. While I had intended to 
     serve out the remainder of my term, after much thought and 
     prayer, my family and I have decided that now is a good time 
     for me to step aside.
       Therefore, effective at 5PM today, April 6, 2018, I have 
     submitted a letter of resignation as a member of the United 
     States House of Representatives representing the 27th 
     District of Texas to Governor Greg Abbott, Texas. (copy 
     attached)
       Helping people, especially veterans with their problems 
     with the government was the high point of my career. I feel 
     like I have made a difference for lots of people 
     individually, the district and the country, but for a variety 
     of reasons, I know in my heart that my time in Congress is 
     over.
       I wish all the best and may God bless us all.
           Sincerely,
                                                 Blake Farenthold,
     Member of Congress.
                                  ____

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2018.
     Hon. Greg Abbott,
     Governor,
     Austin, TX.
       Dear Governor Abbott: It has been an honor and privilege to 
     serve the people of Texas' 27th Congressional District as 
     their representative in Congress. While I had intended to 
     serve out the remainder of my term, after much thought and 
     prayer, my family and I have decided that now is a good time 
     for me to step aside.
       Therefore, effective at 5PM today, April 6, 2018, I resign 
     my position as a member of the United States House of 
     Representatives representing the 27th District of Texas.
       Helping people, especially veterans with their problems 
     with the government was the high point of my career. I feel 
     like I have made a difference for lots of people 
     individually, the district and the country, but for a variety 
     of reasons, I know in my heart that my time in Congress is 
     over.
       I wish all the best and may God bless us all.
           Sincerely,
                                                 Blake Farenthold,
     Member of Congress.
