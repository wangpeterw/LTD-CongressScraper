                          BEWARE OF TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I stand here with this simple explanation 
about what TrumpCare really means for Americans: You pay more for less 
care.
  Twenty-four million Americans will lose the access to health care by 
losing their insurance. It is an age tax on older Americans; and it 
guts Medicaid that not only goes to seniors now, it goes to young 
people as well, young families.
  But it is also a huge tax cut for millionaires.
  If you look at TrumpCare, you realize the great supposed negotiator 
actually has a great reputation of being the great bankrupter.
  What this TrumpCare will do: It will affect tens of millions of 
Americans, and it will put them into misery, take away the dignity of 
health care and put them in a place that no one should ever have to be: 
lacking the dignity of being able to see a doctor. This is going to 
send us back to the Dark Ages.
  You probably think I am exaggerating, but when you look at these 
facts, you realize that is just the truth. These are the facts.
  Beware of what you are being sold. This is not going to help America.
