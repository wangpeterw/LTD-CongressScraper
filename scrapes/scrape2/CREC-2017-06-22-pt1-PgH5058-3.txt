       HONORING THE LIVES OF CURTIS BILLUE AND CHRISTOPHER MONICA

  (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of two 
Georgia State corrections officers, Sergeants Curtis Billue and 
Christopher Monica, who were killed in the line of duty on June 13 in 
Putnam County, Georgia.
  I share with their families the deep sorrow perpetrated by the 
violence of two rogue inmates, and I pray that God comforts the Billue 
and Monica families in their time of grief.
  Described as hardworking, kind, and devoted, Sergeants Billue and 
Monica will be remembered for their service and sacrifice, for their 
loyalty as public servants, and for their love and dedication to their 
families.
  I am grateful that the two perpetrators of this crime have been 
brought back into custody, and I am confident that justice will be 
served.
  American law enforcement officers make a promise to keep our country 
and communities safe. In return, we must restore the tradition of 
respect and honor that is owed to all members of the law enforcement 
community who are on the front lines.
  In gratitude to Sergeants Billue and Monica, Governor Nathan Deal 
ordered the flags of Georgia to fly at halfstaff on July 17 and 20.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing their lives and service 
and to say ``thank you'' to every brother and sister in uniform who 
stand on that thin blue line.
