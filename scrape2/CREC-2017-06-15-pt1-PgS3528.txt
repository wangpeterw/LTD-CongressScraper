            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 
p.m. on Monday, June 19, the Senate proceed to executive session for 
consideration of Executive Calendar No. 108. I further ask that there 
be 30 minutes of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual 
form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate 
vote on confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or 
debate; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified 
of the Senate's actions.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
