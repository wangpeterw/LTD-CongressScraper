                RECOGNIZING COLONEL JOE ``SOLO'' KUNKEL

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding 
member of the United States Air Force, Colonel Joe ``Solo'' Kunkel. 
Solo has been selected for reassignment from Tyndall Air Force Base in 
the Second District of Florida, where he served as the vice commander 
of the 325th Fighter Wing.
  He will continue his service at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho 
as commander of the 366th Fighter Wing, the ``Gunfighters.''
  Colonel Kunkel has been an exceptional leader at Tyndall, where he 
oversaw more than 4,000 people who train and support F-22 Raptor pilots 
and crews.
  He has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of his officers, 
airmen, and their families. He improved mission performance, 
facilities, and family programs at Tyndall.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in extending congratulations and 
gratitude to Colonel Kunkel; his wife, Jenny; and their children, 
Madeline, Drew, Riley, and Brayden.
  May God continue to bless our Nation with his kind of exemplary 
patriotism and service.
