             TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ECONOMIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week I traveled the 
district and heard from constituents who are grateful for the historic 
progress being made by the Trump administration creating jobs.
  President Donald Trump has led a strong pro-business team. The 
economy has added over 800,000 private sector jobs since January. 
Consumer confidence is at a 13-year high. The number of unemployment 
claims has plunged to the lowest level in over 40 years.
  I appreciate the President can share the significance of the DOW 
soaring above 23,000 points, up nearly 5,000 points, or 27 percent, 
since election day, as you can see in his tweet on Wednesday.
  The President's critics will never give him credit for American 
families. Columnist Clarence Page has described the ``anti-Trump 
derangement syndrome'' drives critics to irrational extremes.
  But these critics can't dispute the facts. The fresh faces, fresh 
voices, and fresh ideas that President Donald Trump has brought to 
Washington is making a difference for American families.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
