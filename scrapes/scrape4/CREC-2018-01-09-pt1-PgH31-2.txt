  NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY AND HONORING THE LIFE OF 
                        DEPUTY DANIEL McCARTNEY

  (Mr. REICHERT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, before I came to Congress, I spent 33 
years as a cop. Today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, a 
day to honor our dedicated law enforcement officers who selflessly put 
their lives on the line each and every day to protect our families. We 
not only honor those who protect and serve us today, but we also 
remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.
  Sadly, yesterday, in my community, we experienced the death, the 
murder, of another police officer. His name was Deputy Daniel McCartney 
of the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, shot and killed while 
responding to a burglary call. This brave man was also a Navy veteran 
and leaves behind a wife and three sons--4 years old, 6 years old, and 
9 years old--without a father.
  I ask you to join me today in praying for his family and for his 
colleagues in the Pierce County Sheriff's Department.
  Every day, law enforcement officers are asked to stand tall in the 
face of danger. I know.
  To paraphrase a quote from Sheriff Pastor yesterday after the death 
of his fallen officer, he said: Deputy McCartney ran toward trouble, 
ran to protect. He is a man who served with the heart of a servant, 
with spirit, with strength and compassion.
  Please join me today in thanking our law enforcement officers across 
this Nation for their dedicated service.
