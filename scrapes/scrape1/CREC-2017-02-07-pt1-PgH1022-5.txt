               HONORING THE LIFE OF HENRY ``HANK'' ADAMS

  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the 
life of an exemplary leader in our community, in the Turlock area, and 
the Assyrian community, Henry ``Hank'' Adams. The beloved husband, 
brother, father, and grandfather died at the age of 92 on Friday.
  He was born and raised in Turlock, California, to Reverend Isaac and 
Sarah Adams. His father is known as the patriarch of Turlock's Assyrian 
community. Isaac encouraged his fellow Assyrians to join him in the 
Central Valley and farm in the rich soils of the region.
  In 1943, at the age of 18, Henry graduated from Turlock High School 
and enlisted in the Army Air Corps. Henry completed over 20 bombing 
missions in Japan on the Lucky Lady B-29 bomber. He was discharged at 
the rank of lieutenant in 1947. Henry moved to San Francisco, where he 
married his wife, Joanne, eventually settling down in Turlock.
  Henry had a genuine love for his country and his community. He is 
known for his service and contributions to the Assyrian community, 
where he continued the legacy that his father left behind.
  Henry leaves behind the love of his life and his wife of 62 years, 
Joanne, and their two daughters, Nora Adams and Nellie Adams-Morse.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing the 
tremendous life of Henry ``Hank'' Adams for his service to his country, 
and his unwavering leadership and many accomplishments and 
contributions to the Turlock Assyrian community.
  God bless him always.
