                     FACING A CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today, in Federal district court in 
Washington, Michael Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI, a felony. It 
is a strong indication that he is cooperating with the Mueller 
investigation concerning Russia and its involvement with President 
Trump and his team and the election of the President of the United 
States.
  We are facing a crisis in our country with our Constitution, our form 
of government, and the rule of law. I have filed a bill to amend the 
Constitution to not allow pardons of people from any President's 
campaign team or family. I am also the sponsor of a bill that says you 
can't fire a special counsel without cause. The special counsel would 
have the right to seek redress in court.
  We must be ready to protect Bob Mueller and the integrity of the rule 
of law in this country, for I foresee this President firing him, as 
Nixon did in the Saturday Night Massacre.
  We are repeating the horrors of Watergate and the shredding of our 
Constitution, common sense, and decency.
