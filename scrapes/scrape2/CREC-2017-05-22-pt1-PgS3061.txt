                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent during 
today's vote, Executive Calendar No. 55, due to my son's college 
graduation. Had I been present, I would have voted nay on the 
confirmation of Governor Terry E. Branstad to be the U.S. Ambassador to 
China.
