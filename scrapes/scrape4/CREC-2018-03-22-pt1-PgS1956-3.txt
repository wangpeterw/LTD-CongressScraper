  SA 2223. Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Hoeven) proposed an amendment to the

reservation communities; as follows:

       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Business 
     Incubators Program Act''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds that--
       (1) entrepreneurs face specific challenges when 
     transforming ideas into profitable business enterprises;

[[Page S1964]]

       (2) entrepreneurs that want to provide products and 
     services in reservation communities face an additional set of 
     challenges that requires special knowledge;
       (3) a business incubator is an organization that assists 
     entrepreneurs in navigating obstacles that prevent innovative 
     ideas from becoming viable businesses by providing services 
     that include--
       (A) workspace and facilities resources;
       (B) access to capital, business education, and counseling;
       (C) networking opportunities;
       (D) mentorship opportunities; and
       (E) an environment intended to help establish and expand 
     business operations;
       (4) the business incubator model is suited to accelerating 
     entrepreneurship in reservation communities because the 
     business incubator model promotes collaboration to address 
     shared challenges and provides individually tailored services 
     for the purpose of overcoming obstacles unique to each 
     participating business; and
       (5) business incubators will stimulate economic development 
     by providing Native entrepreneurs with the tools necessary to 
     grow businesses that offer products and services to 
     reservation communities.

     the eligible applicant from providing quality business 
     incubation services to Native businesses and Native 
     entrepreneurs from the 1 or more reservation communities to 
     be served; and
       (II) siting the business incubator in the identified

     year.
       (B) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, 
     the requirements of subparagraph (A) with respect to an 
     eligible applicant if, after considering the ability of the 
     eligible applicant to provide non-Federal contributions, the 
     Secretary determines that--
       (i) the proposed business incubator will provide quality 
     business incubation services; and
       (ii) the 1 or more reservation communities to be served are 
     unlikely to receive similar services because of remoteness or 
     other reasons that inhibit the provision of business and 
     entrepreneurial development services.
       (4) Renewals.--
       (A) In general.--The Secretary may renew a grant award

                                 ______
                                 
  SA 2224. Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Hoeven) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 1116, to amend the Native American Business Development, Trade 
Promotion, and Tourism Act of 2000, the Buy Indian Act, and the Native 
American Programs Act of 1974 to provide industry and economic 
development opportunities to Indian communities; as follows:

       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Community Economic 
     Enhancement Act of 2018''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds that--
       (1)(A) to bring industry and economic development to Indian 
     communities, Indian tribes must overcome a number of 
     barriers, including--
       (i) geographical location;
       (ii) lack of infrastructure or capacity;
       (iii) lack of sufficient collateral and capital; and
       (iv) regulatory bureaucracy relating to--
       (I) development; and
       (II) access to services provided by the Federal Government; 
     and
       (B) the barriers described in subparagraph (A) often add to 
     the cost of doing business in Indian communities;
       (2) Indian tribes--
       (A) enact laws and exercise sovereign governmental powers;
       (B) determine policy for the benefit of tribal members; and
       (C) produce goods and services for consumers;
       (3) the Federal Government has--
       (A) an important government-to-government relationship with 
     Indian tribes; and
       (B) a role in facilitating healthy and sustainable tribal 
     economies;
       (4) the input of Indian tribes in developing Federal policy 
     and programs leads to more meaningful and effective measures 
     to assist Indian tribes and Indian entrepreneurs in building 
     tribal economies;
       (5)(A) many components of tribal infrastructure need 
     significant repair or replacement; and
       (B) access to private capital for projects in Indian 
     communities--
       (i) may not be available; or
       (ii) may come at a higher cost than such access for other 
     projects;
       (6)(A) Federal capital improvement programs, such as those 
     that facilitate tax-exempt bond financing and loan 
     guarantees, are tools that help improve or replace crumbling 
     infrastructure;
       (B) lack of parity in treatment of an Indian tribe as a 
     governmental entity under Federal tax and certain other 
     regulatory laws impedes, in part, the ability of Indian 
     tribes to raise capital through issuance of tax exempt debt, 
     invest as an accredited investor, and benefit from other 
     investment incentives accorded to State and local 
     governmental entities; and
       (C) as a result of the disparity in treatment of Indian 
     tribes described in subparagraph (B), investors may avoid 
     financing, or demand a premium to finance, projects in Indian 
     communities, making the projects more costly or inaccessible;
       (7) there are a number of Federal loan guarantee programs 
     available to facilitate financing of business, energy, 
     economic, housing, and community development projects in 
     Indian communities, and those programs may support public-
     private partnerships for infrastructure development, but 
     improvements and support are needed for those programs 
     specific to Indian communities to facilitate more effectively 
     private financing for infrastructure and other urgent 
     development needs; and
       (8)(A) most real property held by Indian tribes is trust or 
     restricted land that essentially cannot be held as 
     collateral; and
       (B) while creative solutions, such as leasehold mortgages, 
     have been developed in response to the problem identified in 
     subparagraph (A), some solutions remain subject to review and 
     approval by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, adding additional 
     costs and delay to tribal projects.
