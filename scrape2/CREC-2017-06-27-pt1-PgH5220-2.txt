                  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HERKIMER COLLEGE

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th 
anniversary of Herkimer College. Established in 1966 as New York 
State's 29th community college, Herkimer College opened its doors for 
classes in 1967.
  The inaugural class consisted of 221 freshmen, and for the first 4 
years, Herkimer College held classes on the upper floors of the old 
Remington Arms factory in Ilion, New York. In 1971, the college moved 
to its present-day location in the Village of Herkimer.
  Like the Village of Herkimer and Herkimer County, Herkimer College is 
proud to share its name with a Revolutionary War hero, General Nicholas 
Herkimer. As commander of the Tryon County Militia, General Herkimer 
valiantly fought at the Battle of Oriskany. To honor General Herkimer 
and Herkimer County's rich history, Herkimer College's athletic teams 
are nicknamed the Generals.
  Today, Herkimer College currently enrolls over 3,000 students and 
boasts more than 20,000 graduates. The college offers over 40 degree 
programs and is consistently ranked as a top 100 community college in 
the Nation.
  Over the course of five decades, Herkimer College's benefit to the 
local community is evidenced by over $75 million in economic impact in 
Herkimer County, annually.
  Today I recognize Herkimer College for an exceptional 50 years and 
offer my best wishes for many, many successful decades to come.
