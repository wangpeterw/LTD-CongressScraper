           CELEBRATING NICKLAUS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN MIAMI

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the 
Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, which has just been named 
amongst the best children's hospitals in the Nation by U.S. News & 
World Report.
  Since 1950, Nicklaus, located in my congressional district, has been 
a shining light for our community and one of the leading pediatric 
healthcare centers in the world. Its doctors, nurses, and staff work 
tirelessly to provide the highest quality of care to children and teens 
in south Florida every day.
  Nicklaus also includes the Miami Children's Research Institute, one 
of the largest providers of clinical research services for children in 
the Nation. From cardiology to neuroscience, our institute is at the 
forefront of the development of treatments and medicines which are 
improving the lives of kids not just in south Florida, but around the 
world.
  So, once again, congratulations to Nicklaus on being selected as one 
of the best children's hospitals in the United States. Thanks to 
everyone at Nicklaus for continuing to inspire hope and promote 
lifelong health by providing the best care to every child in our 
community.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would ask Members to heed the 
gavel.
