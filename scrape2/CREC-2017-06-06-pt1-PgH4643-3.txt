                          THANK YOU, MR. JONES

  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, there are people in a person's life that 
have a lasting influence, educators who help shape the person that you 
become. Ron Jones of Port Angeles, Washington, was one of those people 
for me and for hundreds of others.
  For the last 42 years, Mr. Jones has been an outstanding music 
teacher who, for generations of students, was a difference maker in a 
way that would make Mr. Holland and his opus jealous. On multiple 
occasions he brought musicians to perform in Carnegie Hall and other 
places all around, and in doing so, he didn't just enhance a student's 
musical skills, he broadened the horizons of young people. I know he 
did that for me. He made you want to be better. He made you want to try 
harder. He made you want to perform well enough to get that genuine Ron 
Jones smile.
  Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Jones prepares for his retirement, it is my honor 
to recognize him here on the floor of the United States House of 
Representatives, to wish him well, and, on behalf of many grateful 
students, to simply say: Thank you, Mr. Jones.
