                        RECOGNIZING JOE FRACCOLA

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Joe Fraccola 
of New Hartford, New York, my hometown.
  Joe was drafted into the United States Army in 1968, serving in the 
Vietnam war. On June 7, 1969, Joe was injured during an enemy rocket 
attack, earning the Purple Heart medal.
  After returning home from Vietnam, Joe worked for the United States 
Postal Service and became active in veterans advocacy in central New 
York, serving as the commander of Central New York Chapter 490 Military 
Order of the Purple Heart.
  Under Joe's leadership, the chapter has visited wounded soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, and marines at Walter Reed; supported military honors 
at funerals and events; assisted in honor flights to the World War II 
Memorial in Washington, D.C., and helped to commemorate the 50th 
anniversary of Vietnam.
  Joe is also active in the Vietnam Veterans of America and supports 
our local Gold Star Mothers.
  Our community owes Joe our gratitude for his service and sacrifice 
for this country and for all he has done to support veterans and their 
families after his service.
