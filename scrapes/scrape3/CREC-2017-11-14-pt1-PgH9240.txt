                         TAX PLAN AND EDUCATION

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues tell me that 
this tax plan will grow the economy and make American workers more 
competitive, but, in reality, the plan would bankrupt our future. It 
threatens provisions that directly support our schools and our 
students. By eliminating the State and local tax deductions, it 
penalizes States and school districts that have chosen to invest in our 
young people.
  In my home State of California, that threatens over $750 in State 
funding per public school student each and every year. For Americans 
with student loan debt, this plan eliminates the student loan interest 
deduction.
  In my district, over 21,000 people claim this deduction each year. As 
a former college professor, I know the sacrifices that many of our 
students have to make to pursue an education. This tax plan asks them 
to pay even more.
  These priorities are out of sync. This is not tax reform that puts 
middle class families first. We can do better.
