                        NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of National Mentoring 
Month and in recognition of the great contributions that mentors make 
to young people and to communities across the country.
  Every young person deserves and needs a mentor, someone with 
experience and perspective to help them overcome challenges and 
navigate uncertainties. I would not be here today without the guidance 
that I received from my mentors, including Supreme Court Justice and 
former Mayor Frank Flaherty, former Mayor Joe Walsh, the late State 
Senator Eleanor Slater, and the late Senator Claiborne Pell.
  Mentorships like these can be life-changing, and I applaud 
organizations like MENTOR Rhode Island, which pairs mentors with at-
risk youth. Vulnerable young people with mentors are more likely to 
maintain better attendance and positive attitudes toward school, and 
they are 55 percent more likely to go to college than their peers.
  Mr. Speaker, it is with deep appreciation for my mentors and the 
power of mentoring that I recognize January as National Mentoring 
Month.
