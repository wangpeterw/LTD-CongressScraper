                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1628

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the 
desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by 
title for the first time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 1628) to provide for reconciliation pursuant 
     to title II of the concurrent resolution on the budget for 
     fiscal year 2017.

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in 
order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule 
XIV, I object to my own request.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative 
day.

                          ____________________
