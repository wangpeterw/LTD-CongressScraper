             IN MEMORY OF THE LIFE AND LEGACYOF LENO BRADBY

  (Mr. McKEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I trespass on the time of the House today 
to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Leno Bradby.
  Mr. Bradby was a true leader of our community--a community in the 
Fourth Congressional District, known as Charles CityCounty. He was an 
active member of his NAACP chapter, of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, as wellas being a member of the Charles 
City County Democratic Committee.
  Mr. Bradby dedicated his time to helping folks vote by supporting 
voter registration and voter education efforts in ourdistrict. He 
regularly volunteered at the polling locations and provided community 
members with transportation to cast theirballots. I know that his 
presence was greatly missed in a special election that was held within 
our district yesterday.
  It is sad to see a devout and active member of our community leave 
us, but his legacy will live on with his fellow communitymembers. This 
is a great loss to Charles City County.
