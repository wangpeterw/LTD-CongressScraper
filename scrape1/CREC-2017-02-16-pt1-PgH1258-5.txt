                   GENERAL FLYNN'S RUSSIAN CONNECTION

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to echo concerns by my 
colleagues. I am concerned, but not surprised, about the growing 
revelations from the intelligence community of the Trump campaign's 
contact with Russian officials. Russia's involvement in our elections 
undermines American democracy.
  General Flynn's resignation is no substitute for answers to grave 
concerns and questions over President Trump's involvement in secret 
communications with the Russians and Vladimir Putin's hand in our 
elections.
  I believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is not just 
about leakers, but this is about the Trump-Russia ties. We need a full, 
bipartisan investigation. It is our duty.
