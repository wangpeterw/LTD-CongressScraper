                 TITLE X FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today deeply disappointed that the 
House has again put attacking women's health over the important 
priorities the American people sent us here to address.
  More than 4 million individuals across the country, many of them low-
income, uninsured, or young, depend on title X for family planning and 
related preventative care. This is lifesaving care: birth control, HIV 
and other STI testing, and cancer screenings, to name a few.
  The resolution that passed today allows States to deny trusted 
reproductive healthcare providers from receiving title X funds for 
purely ideological reasons. Already, 14 States have taken official 
action to exclude Planned Parenthood and other critical reproductive 
healthcare providers from serving patients through the title X program.
  This shameful legislation puts politics ahead of women's health and 
does a disservice to women and families across our Nation.
