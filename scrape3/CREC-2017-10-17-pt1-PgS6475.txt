     discretionary accounts'' mean any provision of a bill, joint 
     resolution, amendment, motion, amendment between the Houses, 
     or conference report that affects direct spending, receipts, 
     or appropriations as those terms have been defined and 
     interpreted for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
     Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.).
       (e) Point of Order.--
       (1) In general.--When the Senate is considering a bill, 
     resolution, amendment, motion, amendment between the Houses, 
     or conference report, if a point of order is made by a 
     Senator against an emergency designation in that measure, 
     that provision making such a designation shall be stricken 
     from the measure and may not be offered as an amendment from 
     the floor.
       (2) Supermajority waiver and appeals.--
       (A) Waiver.--Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended in 
     the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the 
     Members, duly chosen and sworn.
       (B) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of 
     the Chair relating to any provision of this subsection shall 
     be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and 
     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or 
     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of 
     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and 
     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling 
     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this 
     subsection.
       (3) Definition of an emergency designation.--For purposes 
     of paragraph (1), a provision shall be considered an 
     emergency designation if it designates any item as an 
     emergency requirement pursuant to this subsection.
       (4) Form of the point of order.--A point of order under 
     paragraph (1) may be raised by a Senator as provided in 
     section 313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 
     U.S.C. 644(e)).
       (5) Conference reports.--When the Senate is considering a 
     conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in 
     relation to, a bill, upon a point of order being made by any 
     Senator pursuant to this section, and such point of order 
     being sustained, such material contained in such conference 
     report shall be stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to 
     consider the question of whether the Senate shall recede from 
     its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or concur 
     in the House amendment with a further amendment, as the case 
     may be, which further amendment shall consist of only that 
     portion of the conference report or House amendment, as the 
     case may be, not so stricken. Any such motion in the Senate 
     shall be debatable. In any case in which such point of order 
     is sustained against a conference report (or Senate amendment 
     derived from such conference report by operation of this 
     subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.
       (f) Criteria.--
       (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, any 
     provision is an emergency requirement if the situation 
     addressed by such provision is--
       (A) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful or 
     beneficial);
       (B) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up 
     over time;
       (C) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring 
     immediate action;
       (D) subject to paragraph (2), unforeseen, unpredictable, 
     and unanticipated; and
       (E) not permanent, temporary in nature.
       (2) Unforeseen.--An emergency that is part of an aggregate 
     level of anticipated emergencies, particularly when normally 
     estimated in advance, is not unforeseen.
       (g) Inapplicability.--In the Senate, section 403 of S. Con. 
     Res. 13 (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the 
     budget for fiscal year 2010, shall no longer apply.

     authority and total outlays provided by a measure shall 
     include any discretionary amounts described in subsection

       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
     the Senate to change those rules at any time, in the same 
     manner, and to the same extent as is the case of any other 
     rule of the Senate.

     SEC. 41__. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ENDING MEDICARE AS WE KNOW

       (a) In General.--When the Senate is considering a bill, 
     joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the 
     Houses, or conference report, if a point of order is made by 
     a Senator against a provision that eliminates the guaranteed 
     health

[[Page S6489]]

     insurance benefits for seniors and people with disabilities 
     under the Medicare program, increases costs for seniors and 
     people with disabilities by establishing a Medicare voucher 
     or premium support plan that provides limited payments to 
     Medicare beneficiaries to purchase health care in the private 
     health insurance market, or weakens the traditional Medicare 
     program by diverting the healthiest enrollees into private 
     plans and undermining traditional Medicare's ability to 
     control costs while offering access to a broad range of 
     providers, and the point of order is sustained by the Chair, 
     that provision shall be stricken from the measure and may not 
     be offered as an amendment from the floor.
       (b) Form of the Point of Order.--A point of order under 
     subsection (a) may be raised by a Senator as provided in 
     section 313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2

     conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in 
     relation to, a bill or joint resolution, upon a point of 
     order being made by any Senator pursuant to subsection (a), 
     and such point of order being sustained, such material 
     contained in such conference report or House amendment shall 
     be stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to consider the 
     question of whether the Senate shall recede from its 
     amendment and concur with a further amendment, or concur in 
     the House amendment with a further amendment, as the case may 
     be, which further amendment shall consist of only that 
     portion of the conference report or House amendment, as the 
     case may be, not so stricken. Any such motion in the Senate 
     shall be debatable. In any case in which such point of order 
     is sustained against a conference report (or Senate amendment 
     derived from such conference report by operation of this 
     subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.
       (d) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--In the Senate, this 
     section may be waived or suspended only by an affirmative 
     vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chose and sworn. An 
     affirmative vote of three-fifths of Members of the Senate,
