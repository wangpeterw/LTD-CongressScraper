                        TRIBUTE TO SHELLI COFFEY

  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize Shelli Coffey for all of 
her hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South 
Dakota while working in my Washington, DC, office.
  Shelli has spent her career working at the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, spending time in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and 
Washington, DC. Shelli's insight into regulations and community banks 
has been a true asset to the office.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Shelli for all of the 
fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the years to 
come.
