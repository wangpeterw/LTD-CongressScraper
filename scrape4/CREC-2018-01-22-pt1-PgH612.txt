           SHARING IN THE FRUSTRATION OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I share the frustration of the American 
public who overwhelmingly support protecting young DREAMers, 
authorizing the Children's Health Program and the community health 
centers that serve them, and funding government long term, not week to 
week.
  Part of the solution is obvious: Donald Trump should not be in the 
negotiations, in part, because he doesn't understand the complexities. 
Indeed, it appears he doesn't even understand the basics. He frequently 
changes his mind, agreeing with what he last saw on FOX News or heard 
from the last person he talked to.
  The weekend news was filled with accounts of his confusion and how 
destructive his participation has been, acknowledged by Republicans and 
Democrats alike, even frustrating his own staff.
  Maybe it is time to just ignore Donald Trump and his tweets, send him 
lots of cheeseburgers, and keep this news off FOX. Without Trump's 
participation, we will reach a better solution, and we will do it 
faster.
