                       YEARS OF TERROR IN EUROPE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is sad many Americans 
have forgotten the ongoing global war on terrorism declared against 
Western families by war fatwas in 1996 and 1998, as displayed at the 
entrance of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York 
City.
  In the last year, there has been a year of terror in Europe, as 
reported by The Washington Times on Friday. Beginning in defiance of 
the anniversary of Bastille Day on July 14, 2016, at Nice, France, with 
86 people murdered, it continued with attacks in Berlin, Germany, on 
July 18; Ansbach, Germany, on July 24; Reutlingen, Germany, on July 24; 
Normandy, France, on July 26; Berlin, Germany, on December 19; 
Istanbul, Turkey, on January 1; London, England, on March 22; 
Stockholm, Sweden, on April 7; Paris, France, on April 20; Manchester, 
England, on May 22; and London, England, on June 3.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. We will never forget 
the 85 men and women murdered in the AMIA Jewish Center bombing in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am grateful President Donald Trump is taking 
actions to protect American families.
