          RECOGNITION OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the Asian 
Pacific Development Center, a community-based nonprofit organization, 
which has been serving the Asian American and Pacific Islander 
communities in the State of Colorado for over 35 years. Their 
commitment to service is truly an inspiration for all Coloradans.
  The Asian Pacific Development Center guides itself by its founding 
mission, which is to advance the well-being of Asian American and 
Pacific Islander communities of Colorado by providing culturally 
appropriate and integrated behavioral, medical, and related services. 
By adhering to such a noble purpose, the Asian Pacific Development 
Center is able to provide crucial services in native languages with a 
cultural understanding.
  Originally founded in 1980 by Dr. Rudy Lie, and currently headed by 
Ms. Chris Wanifuchi, I am proud of just how important the Asian Pacific 
Development Center is to our community. I look forward to working with 
them in the many more years of service to come.
