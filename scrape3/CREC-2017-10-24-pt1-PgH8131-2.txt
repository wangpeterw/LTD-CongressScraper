                          RECOGNIZING BAT WEEK

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Bat Week, which is an annual, week-long event highlighting the 
important ecological and economic benefits of bats.
  With more than 1,300 different species worldwide, bats are both 
diverse in appearance and how they keep ecosystems balanced. Bats play 
an essential role with insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal. 
One bat can eat 2,000 to 6,000 insects each night, including moths, 
beetles, flies, mosquitoes, and more.
  Because of their incredible appetites, farmers can use fewer 
pesticides to control insects. This helps our Nation's farmers and 
saves billions of dollars each year.
  Mr. Speaker, bats also play other roles outside of our ecosystems, 
including in medical research. Scientists studying vampire bats have 
created anticlotting medication to help stroke victims.
  These are just a small portion of the ways bats positively impact our 
daily lives, and I am pleased to see these wonderful creatures 
recognized during Bat Week.
  I appreciate the great work being performed by private conservation 
organizations, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, U.S. 
Geological Survey, and many other State partners, such as the 
Pennsylvania Game Commission on Bat Week 2017.
