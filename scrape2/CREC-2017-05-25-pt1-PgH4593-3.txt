                         CHILD RESCUE COALITION

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I supported the Protecting 
Against Child Exploitation Act to help stop the unspeakable cruelty of 
child pornography.
  The trade of child pornography on the internet is not just 
information streaming across wires, it is abuse; and those who trade in 
child pornography are compounding the physical abuse of innocent 
victims who are depicted in these horrible images. They are real 
children next door and across the country.
  An astounding 28 percent of American youth will be sexually 
victimized at some point in their lives. Thankfully, the Child Rescue 
Coalition in Boca Raton, Florida, is already fighting back. They are 
using real-time data to help law enforcement track sexual predators 
from the darkest corners of the internet to their front door.
  Child Rescue Coalition has used their cutting edge technology as a 
critical partner with law enforcement and child advocates to help 
rescue over 2,000 lonely, afraid, and hurt children across the world.
  I thank my constituent, Carly Yoost, for the heroic work of the Child 
Rescue Coalition--shielding, rescuing, and safeguarding children from 
sexual exploitation.
