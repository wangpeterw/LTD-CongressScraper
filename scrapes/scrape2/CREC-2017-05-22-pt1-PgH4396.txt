                         FARM BUREAU CENTENNIAL

  (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
centennial anniversary of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, our 
State's leading and largest farm organization.
  Since 1917, Nebraska Farm Bureau has been a grassroots, statewide 
organization led by farmers and ranchers who work to enhance and 
strengthen the lives of all Nebraskans. This Federation of 85 county 
farm bureaus has more than 61,000 member families in all 93 Nebraska 
counties.
  For 100 years, Nebraska Farm Bureau has united our State's farm and 
ranch families under a common banner, doing together what they cannot 
do alone. Through the power of their grassroots policy development 
process, Nebraska Farm Bureau remains the trusted voice for Nebraska 
farm and ranch families.
  This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Farm Bureau's existence, 
and we congratulate the organization and all of its members on reaching 
this important milestone. We are excited for what the next 100 years 
have in store.
