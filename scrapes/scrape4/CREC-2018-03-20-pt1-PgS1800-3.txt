                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, while the Senate conducts an important 
debate today on Yemen, we continue to negotiate an omnibus spending 
bill. It will follow through on the bipartisan budget deal we struck in 
February that, for the first time in a long time, will robustly fund 
our military and provide substantial investment in our middle class.
  For too long, the arbitrary and pointless sequester caps held back 
Federal investment in jobs, scientific research, healthcare, and 
education. They also handicapped our military and prevented long-term 
planning at the Pentagon. The budget deal paved the way to do away with 
the harmful sequester caps, and now the omnibus will put the nail in 
the coffin.
  Negotiations continue between the four leaders. A few sticking points 
remain but we are very close to signing off on legislation that both 
Houses will be able to take up and pass by the end of the week.
  Mr. President, on the omni, I agree with the leader. Hopefully, we 
can come to an agreement and pass it this week. It has some things no 
one likes, and it has a lot of things not everybody likes but most 
people like. The basic structure of it was a fair compromise, and, 
hopefully, we can come to an agreement. Our staffs are working really 
hard.
