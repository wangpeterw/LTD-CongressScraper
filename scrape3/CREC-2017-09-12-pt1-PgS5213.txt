 Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 
distinguished career of Marshal Don Slaznik of O'Fallon, IL. Don is 
retiring as U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Illinois, a 
position that he has the distinction of having held under three 
Presidents, being first nominated by President Bush and confirmed in 
2002 and retained by President Obama in 2009.
  Don has served his country with dignity and honor as an Active-Duty 
member of the U.S. Marines and the U.S. Army in the 1960s and 1970s.
  Since then, he has been the chief of police in Poplar Bluff, MO, 
Storm Lake, IA, and O'Fallon, IL, and served in leadership positions 
with the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, the Southern 
Illinois Police Chief's Association, the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police, and the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.
  In 2015, under Don's leadership, the Southern District of Illinois 
received the highest award given by the U.S. Marshal's Service: the 
Distinguished District Award.
  While he will be missed, we will remember this public citizen for his 
tireless, dedicated, and honorable commitment to service Many thanks to 
U.S. Marshal Slaznik and his family for their sacrifices and 
contributions to our community.
  Thank you.
