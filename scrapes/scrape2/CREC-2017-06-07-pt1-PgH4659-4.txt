                          WHERE ARE THE JOBS?

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, our focus should be on education and job 
creation. We should invest in transportation and infrastructure; invest 
in research and development; invest in technology and innovation; and 
invest in working families, middle class folks, and senior citizens.
  Instead, House Republicans have shortened the workweek and canceled 
votes on Friday.
  Why?
  Apparently because James Comey is testifying tomorrow and they want 
to get out of town before sundown. That is an abdication of 
responsibility, a dereliction of duty, and a classic example of 
legislative malpractice.
  ``Where are the jobs?'' the American people are asking. House 
Republicans are missing in action and the American people deserve 
better.
