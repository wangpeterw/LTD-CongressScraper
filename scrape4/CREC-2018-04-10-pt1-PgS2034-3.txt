                       TRIBUTE TO HEATHER HICKOX

 Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I recognize Heather Hickox, 
the Baker County Teacher of the Year from Baker County Pre-K/
Kindergarten Center in Macclenny, FL.
  Heather was named Teacher of the Year after exhibiting great use of 
strategies to meet all learning styles. In her classroom, mathematical 
concepts are taught well beyond what is expected to be seen at her 
students' grade level. She is also known for showing excellent 
orientation to her lessons through clearly posted objectives and 
activation of background knowledge.
  According to Heather, every student is important and deserves the 
chance to achieve their goals. She believes it is the job of teachers 
to support and encourage students on their journey, to help them find 
their passions, and to give them the tools they need to be successful.
  Heather received her bachelor of arts degree in elementary education 
in 2010 from the University of North Florida, graduating summa cum 
laude and on the president's list. She began her teaching career at 
Baker County Pre-K/Kindergarten Center and has been there for 6 years.
  I extend my best wishes to Heather for all the hard work and 
dedication she has for her students and look forward to hearing of her 
continued success in the years to come.
