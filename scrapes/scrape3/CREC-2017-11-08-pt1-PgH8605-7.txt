                     WELCOMING PASTOR JEFF WILLIAMS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bacon). Without objection, the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, it is my absolute privilege and 
honor to welcome Pastor Jeff Williams, who just led us in the opening 
prayer. He is the head pastor at Faith Community Church in Janesville, 
Wisconsin.

  Jeff is the son of a Swedish immigrant. Pastor Jeff began in the 
ministry at his home church in Rockford, Illinois, where he was born 
and raised.
  In 1989, he and his wife, Brenda, moved about 30 minutes north up I-
90 to begin Faith Community Church in Janesville. ``We had nothing but 
a vision,'' he said. ``No people, no equipment, and no place to meet. 
Just a vision and the Lord. And that was enough.''
  Over the years, Pastor Jeff has turned that vision into a beautiful 
house of worship and fellowship at the heart of our community. I have 
been there many times. It is really an impressive place.
  Pastor Jeff has been a very good friend to me and to our family for 
many years. I will note, however, that he is a Bears fan, and we can 
forgive him for that one.
  But it is an absolute honor and privilege of mine to honor and to 
welcome Pastor Jeff here, and I want to thank him for offering today's 
prayer.
