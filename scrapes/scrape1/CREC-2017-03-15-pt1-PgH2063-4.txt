Speaker's table the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 1) approving the 
location of a memorial to commemorate and honor the members of the 
Armed Forces who served on active duty in support of Operation Desert 
Storm or Operation Desert Shield, and ask for its immediate

     of the determination of the Secretary of the Interior that 
     the memorial should be located in Area I: Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
