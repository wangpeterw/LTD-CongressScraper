       OAKLAND COUNTY WATER MAIN BREAK AND INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address the 
infrastructure crisis our country is facing.
  Today, in Oakland County, Michigan, in the heart of my district, we 
are struggling with a major water main break. In my district, schools 
are being closed and hospitals are transporting patients to nearby 
areas. It will be days before the region will receive access to 
reliable, safe drinking water.
  This is not an isolated incident. We are not investing in our 
Nation's infrastructure. Not surprisingly, Michigan's infrastructure 
received a D grade from the American Society of Civil Engineers. This 
is unacceptable.
  Lack of investment, lack of action is a matter of public health and 
public safety. It is a matter of life and death. It is obvious today in 
my district, but also in districts across this country.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to ignore this crisis. We need 
an infrastructure plan. Flint, Michigan, showed us that infrastructure 
is about the lives of American citizens. Let's work together to fix our 
Nation's infrastructure.
