  RISING IN SUPPORT OF FULLY FUNDING THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE 
                                PROGRAM

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to fully support the funding 
of CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program. CHIP plays a very 
important role in providing low-income children across the country with 
health insurance.
  Without CHIP, over 9 million children nationwide, including 90,000 in 
my great home in Michigan, will lose access to doctor checkups, 
immunizations, and basic healthcare.
  For the last 2 days, we heard numerous concerns for the unborn 
children. We must show that same compassion toward the low-income 
children who are alive and living in our communities, whose access to 
critical healthcare, including CHIP, is a matter of life or death.
  CHIP's impact is felt in communities of color, 52 percent of Hispanic 
and 54 percent of all Black children nationwide.
  As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect our Nation's 
children. We need to extend funding for CHIP and support the millions 
of families who rely on this program. Let's take care of our children 
in America.
