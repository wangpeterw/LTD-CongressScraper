                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the benefits 
that many Americans across the country are already seeing from the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act.
  After hearing leaders of the Democratic Party call $1,000 ``crumbs,'' 
I wanted to make sure my colleagues on

[[Page H456]]

the other side of the aisle understood that our tax reform and relief 
plan is more than just crumbs to over 2 million Americans.
  Immediately following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we 
saw an outpouring of businesses announce they would offer bonuses to 
their employees, and some even increased their wages. This money was 
instantly invested back into American workers.
  I would like to see one of my colleagues from the other side of the 
aisle come to Mississippi and see the response they get after they tell 
the Levins and the Ladners in Saucier, Mississippi, that $1,000 is only 
crumbs. I promise you they would only say it once.
  As we go into 2018, I will continue highlighting real stories of 
Mississippi businesses that are benefiting from our new Tax Code.
