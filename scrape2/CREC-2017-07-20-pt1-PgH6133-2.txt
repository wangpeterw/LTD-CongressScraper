                     RECOGNIZING GABRIELLA BOFFELLI

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, last night I was proud to present my 
legislative director, Gabriella Boffelli, with the Vermillion Award of 
the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute, CHLI, named after the 
late Steve Vermillion, the former chief of staff to Congressman Lincoln 
Diaz-Balart.
  This award is presented each year to two staffers who exemplify 
Steve's huge heart and dedication to freedom. None are more deserving 
than Gaby, and her fellow honoree, Angela Ramirez.
  Since starting as an intern in my Miami office 6 years ago, Gaby has 
risen through the ranks, year after year, serving our south Florida 
community with wisdom, grace, and integrity. Now completing a master's 
degree at Johns Hopkins University, Gaby is the consummate public 
servant, selflessly working on behalf of our constituents, while 
constantly fighting for democracy and human rights in places like 
Nicaragua.
  It has been an honor to have Gaby Boffelli on my team, and I know 
this is just the beginning of an extraordinary career.
