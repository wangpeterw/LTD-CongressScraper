           TAKE ACTION ON A COMPREHENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL

  (Mr. O'HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue 
impacting communities throughout Arizona's First Congressional District 
and the country. We must take action on a comprehensive infrastructure 
bill. Our crumbling roads and bridges pose a greater threat to safety 
with every car, truck, and school bus that crosses them.
  Our pilots land on runways long overdue for repairs, and rural and 
travel communities, without access to modern technology, lose their 
competitive advantage in business and education.
  In Arizona, flood control projects in Winslow, essential broadband 
access in Tuba City, and transportation infrastructure in rural Gila 
County are all in need of attention.
  This is something that impacts every State, every district in this 
country, and I believe we can find broad bipartisan support on this 
issue in Congress.
  Ensuring that our communities have adequate resources to repair their 
roads, invest in technology, and protect their residents is of 
paramount importance. I call on my colleagues to continue working on 
this.
  We cannot push this issue aside any longer. We must come together and 
pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill that invests in our rural 
communities.
