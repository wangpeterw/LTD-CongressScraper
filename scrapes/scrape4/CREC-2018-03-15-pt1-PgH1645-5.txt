             RUSSIAN CHEMICAL ATTACK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly condemn the March 4 
chemical attacks conducted by the Kremlin in Salisbury, England, 
against former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his 
daughter Yulia. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, the first on the scene, 
has also been hospitalized.
  Mr. Speaker, Vladimir Putin continues to display a pattern of 
interfering with and undermining the democratic processes and 
institutions in contravention of the rules-based international order. 
We have seen that in Russia's frequent disruptive cyber operations and 
now chemical warfare.
  How far will they push things?
  Mr. Speaker, that is why I, along with Representatives Meeks, Wilson, 
Cole, Holding, and Sires, introduced a resolution this afternoon 
condemning this attack, calling for accountability for this and all 
chemical and biological attacks and standing in firm partnership with 
our friends and allies in the United Kingdom.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this 
important statement of solidarity in condemnation and also in praying 
for the health of Sergei, Yulia, and Nick.
