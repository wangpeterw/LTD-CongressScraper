               CONGRATULATING MISS NORTH DAKOTA CARA MUND

  (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Miss North Dakota Cara 
Mund, who was crowned Miss America last Sunday.
  A native of Bismarck, Cara made history in our State when she became 
the first North Dakotan to be crowned Miss America. Throughout the 
competition, Cara shared her desire to make her home State proud, and 
boy did she do that, encouraging others to follow their dreams, saying: 
`` . . . it doesn't matter where you come from geographically.''
  When asked what she hoped to gain from her year as Miss America, Cara 
said she is focused on what she can do for others. Cara has been giving 
back for years, having raised more than $78,000 for the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation through her Passion for Fashion Show that she founded when 
she was just 14 years old.
  As she travels the United States, I know she will inspire and impress 
everyone she comes in contact with. This former Capitol Hill intern 
plans to attend law school, become the first woman Governor of North 
Dakota, and perhaps even represent her State in Congress one day. I 
hope she waits a while. But anyway, Kris and I join all North Dakotans 
in congratulating our new Miss America.
  We are proud of you, Cara, and we look forward to hearing the 
positive message you are going to be sharing throughout this Nation 
throughout the next year.
