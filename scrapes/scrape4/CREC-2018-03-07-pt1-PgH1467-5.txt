                   HONORING THE LIFE OF DANA GARDNER

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Dana 
Gardner, who attended the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas on 
October 1.
  Dana worked for San Bernardino County, California, for 26 years in 
the Assessor-Recorder Office. When she went home for the day, she 
always made sacrifices for her three children and two grandchildren. 
She wanted to make sure that her kids understood the importance of 
loving and caring for all humans. She did this through her actions as a 
dedicated public servant.
  Dana was an amazing cook who had just begun to travel more and spend 
more time with her friends. She had a contagious smile and a great 
sense of humor that could light up a room. She is remembered by all 
those who knew her as a go-to person with a lot of knowledge and a can-
do attitude.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Dana Gardner's family and 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.
