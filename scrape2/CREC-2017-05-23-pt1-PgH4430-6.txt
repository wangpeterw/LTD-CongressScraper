                      OPPOSING PRESIDENT'S BUDGET

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, today the President put forward his budget 
proposal. It will be damaging to the people in our communities and the 
places that we call home.
  It cuts Medicaid by over $600 billion and cuts the food stamp program 
by over 25 percent, affecting the most needy within our communities. It 
slashes infrastructure programs, eliminates TIGER grants, cuts student 
loan and financial aid programs, and includes catastrophic cuts to the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
  For my home State of Hawaii, this budget zeroes out Federal funding 
for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grants, the Native Hawaiian Loan 
Guarantee program, and cuts Native Hawaiian education programs by 
nearly $33 million, crippling the progress that has been made for over 
30 years to strengthen Native Hawaiian early education, literacy, 
gifted and talented education programs, higher education, vocational 
programs, and more.
  I strongly oppose this budget, and I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in Congress to pass a budget that actually serves the people 
and our planet.
