                       DROWNING PREVENTION MONTH

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the two 
children who die every single day in the United States as a result of 
drowning.
  I want to recognize the Young Men's Christian Association, the YMCA, 
for their efforts to empower youth with the imperative skills and 
knowledge to prevent these tragic accidents.
  Drowning is the number two cause of death for children ages 1 to 4, 
second only to birth defects. In Texas alone, 107 children lost their 
lives due to drowning last year. In 2017, we have already lost 14.
  Mr. Speaker, these statistics are absolutely unacceptable. Both in 
Texas and across the Nation, there is an opportunity and a need to save 
these young individuals.
  The YMCA is example of an organization that is changing the 
statistics for kids across the country. It is bringing swimming safety 
and drowning prevention to communities that historically could not 
obtain them before. It partners with local schools to transport kids to 
the Y for year-round swimming lessons.
  I am proud to say that the YMCA of Austin is one of many across the 
country implementing the Safety Around Water program. The program 
strives to reduce these incidences by going into overlooked communities 
to provide the necessary resources for kids who otherwise would not 
have access to these lifesaving skills.
  I applaud the Austin YMCA on its tireless efforts to save the lives 
of our children.
  In God we trust.
