                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Lord God, our shelter in the time of storms, thank You for 
Your mercies that are new each day. Lord, through many dangers You have 
brought us, and we would not be guilty of ingratitude. We are grateful 
for catastrophes that haven't happened, for the unseen angels who have 
guarded our Nation and those we love. May our lawmakers remember that 
all efforts to defend ourselves will fail without Your sovereign will 
and loving providence. May our Senators not put their trust only in 
their ingenuity and courage but instead lean on You, the Author and 
Finisher of our faith. Today, lead our legislators on right paths as 
they trust You to clear the road on which they travel. Order their 
steps and direct their way, training them in Your school of humility so 
that they will strive to bring glory to You.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
