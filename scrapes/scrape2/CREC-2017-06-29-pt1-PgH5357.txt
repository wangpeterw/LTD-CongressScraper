               HAPPY BIRTHDAY RICHARD ``THE KING'' PETTY

  (Mr. WALKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, our country will celebrate our 
independence and the rebuke of the British monarchy. Even still, we 
know across America, but especially in the great State of North 
Carolina, we have our own king, who turns 80 on Sunday.
  Richard ``The King'' Petty is the most decorated and respected driver 
in the history of motor sports. His legendary 43 car dominated race 
tracks for decades. He has even been awarded the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom by President George H.W. Bush.
  More importantly than Mr. Petty's work on the track are the lives 
that he has impacted. The Petty family, through the work of multiple 
charities and the impactful Victory Junction Camp, has served children 
with disabilities in incredible ways.
  Mr. Petty, you and Kyle and the rest of the family even showed what 
grace and dignity looks like in the loss of a grandson.
  We wish you a happy birthday today, Richard ``The King'' Petty. Thank 
you for all you do for the people of North Carolina, and I will be 
looking for that hat, those sunglasses, and that bright smile for years 
to come.
