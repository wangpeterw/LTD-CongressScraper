               RECOGNIZING THE MASSACHUSETTS WALKING TOUR

 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 
Massachusetts Walking Tour. Founded in 2010 in Webster, MA, the Walking 
Tour recognizes and celebrates local arts and culture throughout 
Massachusetts by featuring a nonprofit concert tour across the 
Commonwealth. Every concert is unique as it pairs the traveling 
musicians with local artists and outdoor recreation enthusiasts and is 
free for the whole community. These memorable events include diverse 
artistic and musical performances and even discussions about public 
land use with outdoor educators and trail managers. Since its founding, 
the Walking Tour has visited 90 towns in Massachusetts, playing 101 
free community concerts. I thank founders Mark Mandeville and Raianne 
Richards, as well as all of the performers, artists, educators, and 
nature enthusiasts who have made Walking Tour such a success across 
Massachusetts.
