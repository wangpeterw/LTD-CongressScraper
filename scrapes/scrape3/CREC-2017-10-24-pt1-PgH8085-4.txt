                        NEED TO REJECT TAX BREAK

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I think all Americans and certainly Members 
of Congress agree that we need to simplify our Tax Code, make it easier 
for middle class families to get ahead and to stay ahead. 
Unfortunately, what we know about the Republican tax plan, as the 
details begin to leak out, go in a different direction.
  This is a tax break, a big tax cut for billionaires at the expense of 
working families. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a 
family making $50,000 could see their tax bill increase by as much as 
380 percent--less money to set aside for retirement, less money to set 
aside for a child's education, less money to pay the bills that 
families who struggle work hard every month to pay, in order to fund a 
tax break for the wealthiest Americans.
  5,400 families would get a $270 billion tax cut funded by increased 
taxes on people who work hard every day just to make ends meet. Just 
saying that this is tax relief for all Americans over and over again 
does not make it true. The details actually matter.
  This is a big tax break for the wealthiest Americans. People like the 
Trumps and the DeVoses don't need more relief. We need to reject it.
