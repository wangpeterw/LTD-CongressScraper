                      THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, in recent weeks, I held three townhall 
meetings and a roundtable discussion about health care in my district. 
Hundreds of constituents attended, and altogether I spent more than 10 
hours listening to our folks.
  The best ideas come from the people, Madam Speaker. I know you know 
that, and I feel it is my duty as a Representative to hear my 
constituents' input.
  The American Health Care Act reflects what I have heard from 
patients, families, doctors, and many others over the past 8 years. Our 
bill will lower costs, increase choices, and give patients greater 
control of their health care. We are helping middle-income Americans 
gain access to affordable coverage. It also protects those with 
preexisting conditions and allows young adults to stay on their 
parents' insurance until age 26.
  Most importantly, this legislation is moving through the Congress in 
an open and transparent manner. I invite the people of Florida's 12th 
Congressional District and everyone to read and share the American 
Health Care Act at readthebill.gop.
