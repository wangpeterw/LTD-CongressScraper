                       TRIBUTE TO DR. ERICA TOWLE

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Erica Towle, a Knauss 
Sea Grant fellow on the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, for all of the hard work she has done for me, my staff, 
and other members of the committee over the past year. Dr. Towle 
received her Ph.D. in coral reef ecology from the University of Miami. 
In her postgraduate work, she has used her scientific expertise to 
inform public policy. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to 
Dr. Towle for all of the fine work she has done. I wish her continued 
success in the years to come.
