                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Paul Meyers, Roscoe United Methodist Church, Roscoe, 
Illinois, offered the following prayer:
  Gracious God, as we stand here today on the shoulders of all the 
giants who have come before, we ask Your blessing on these, Your 
current lawmakers who are the giants of our own time. Our past was 
protected by You, and, because of this, we entrust our present and our 
future to You as well.
  These, Your servants of this great Nation, reflect Your will when 
they create and enforce laws for the betterment and safety of Your 
people. I pray for Your wisdom and guidance to be upon them, and that 
Your mighty arms enfold them in blessing.
  May good continue to conquer evil. May Your truth make us free. We 
humbly ask You to continue to bless the United States of America.
  Amen.
