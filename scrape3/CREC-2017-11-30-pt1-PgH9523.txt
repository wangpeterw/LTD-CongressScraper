              RECOGNIZING MASTER SERGEANT GILBERT HOWLAND

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Master Sergeant 
Gilbert Howland of Langhorne, Pennsylvania, one of my constituents and 
a member of Merrill's Marauders.
  Merrill's Marauders was a top-secret unit of commandos who served 
behind Japanese lines in Burma, China, and India during World War II. 
The men of this magnificent unit volunteered to serve and faced some of 
the most vicious and consistent fighting of the war. Their commitment 
to service stands as a profound example of sacrifice for our Nation.
  Master Sergeant Howland was an NCO in charge of 16 men and two heavy 
weapons in this unit. After being discharged in 1945, Ranger Howland 
did not sit idly by. Instead, he reenlisted to serve in Korea and for 
two tours in Vietnam.
  Mr. Speaker, Master Sergeant Howland and the rest of the brave men in 
Merrill's Marauders should be recognized. I am proud to support H.R. 
667, which seeks to award the Congressional Gold Medal to World War 
II's Merrill's Marauders.
