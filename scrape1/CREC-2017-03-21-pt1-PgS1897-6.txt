                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1181

  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the 
desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 1181) to amend title 38, United States Code, 
     to clarify the conditions under which certain persons may be 
     treated as adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain 
     purposes.

  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in 
order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule 
XIV, I object to my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the title of the 
bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative day.
