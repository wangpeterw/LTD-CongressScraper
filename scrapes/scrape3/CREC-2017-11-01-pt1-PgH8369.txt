             DIVERSITY IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM NEEDS TO END

  (Mr. DONOVAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mourn those lost and injured in 
yesterday's terror attack in New York City. The New York City Police 
Department is truly the greatest police force in the world, and they 
showed us why yesterday.
  It is this body's obligation to pursue policies that help prevent and 
recover from terrorist attacks. It is a responsibility I am privileged 
to share as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee 
on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications.
  The alleged perpetrator came to our country legally using the 
Diversity Immigrant Visa program. As a matter of security and 
commonsense, an immigration system that selects winners like a game of 
bingo should end.
  I also ask that Congress consider the bipartisan STOP Act, 
legislation I proposed with Mr. Espaillat from New York to help local 
jurisdictions install protective bollards in areas with high pedestrian 
traffic. Vehicle attacks are tough to prevent, but the STOP Act will 
protect Americans and make them safer.
  Mr. Speaker, I send prayers for the injured and the families of the 
lost.
