Under theleadership of Reverend Diane Givens Moffett, Saint James embraces the theme: 150 Years, Celebrating Our Walk-in Faith and It is rare but wonderful to find a group of individuals who have thoroughly enriched their community through dedicatedservice and good works. It has been my unique honor to represent the good people of Saint James Presbyterian both in NorthCarolina and in the Congress for more than 30 years. Saint James has helped make Greensboro a more just and peaceful community,and for that, I am immensely proud.  Congratulations, once again, Saint James, on your anniversary--a century plus five decades. I look forward to witnessing themany ways in which Saint James will continue to thrive during its next 150 years.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH403-4.txt,2201,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,12.0,March
12223,topic-id,1130,"Mr.President, the Health Care Options Act of 2017, introduced by Senator Corker and me, would address the emergency in the health insurance exchanges in Tennessee and in other This legislation would allow any American who receives a subsidy and has no insurance available on their exchange next year to use that subsidy to buy any State-approved insurance off the exchange.  Second, the legislation would waive the Affordable Care Act requirement that these Americans--who, remember, have zero insurance options for their subsidies--have to pay a penalty for not purchasing the insurance.  Third, the legislation would bring peace of mind between now and the beginning of 2018 to millions of Americans--some of the most vulnerable people in our country--who face having zero options of health insurance to purchase with their subsidy in the year 2018 because of the collapsing ObamaCare exchange markets.  Here is why urgent action is needed. There are 11 million Americans who buy individual insurance now on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Approximately 85 percent of them receive a subsidy to help them buy insurance. For those who don't like subsidies for people buying insurance, I would remind us that about 60 percent of insured Americans get insurance on the job, and the average tax break for people with employer sponsored insurance is about $5,000. What we are talking about is the 4 percent of insured people who don't get insurance on the job, who don't get it from the government and Medicare and Medicaid, and this subsidy gives them some money to help them buy insurance if they are mostly low income.  While these 11 million make up only 4 percent of the total insured population in this country, this 4 percent is where much of today's political turmoil rests.  In the Knoxville area where I live, the one remaining insurance company on the Affordable Care Act exchange has pulled out for the year 2018. So it is a near certainty that there will be zero insurance options for 40,000 Tennesseans who live there and buy their insurance on the exchange. In other words, for approximately 34,000 Tennesseans living in Knoxville who rely on an Affordable Care Act subsidy to buy health insurance, their subsidies will be worth as much as a bus ticket in a town with no buses running.  There is a real prospect that the same thing may happen to all 230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the exchange. As I said, 85 percent of them rely on a subsidy to afford insurance; they just will not have any insurance policies to buy.  The decision Friday by the House of Representatives to not vote on the health care bill changes nothing about the urgency of rescuing these 230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges that our State insurance commissioner has told us are ``very near collapse.''  While Congress continues its work to enact long-term structural health reforms, we must take immediate action to help these 230,000 Tennesseans and millions of Americans in other States facing the same dire consequences.  This is not just a problem for Last year, 7 percent of counties in the country had just one insurer offering plans on their Affordable Care Act exchange. This year, that 7 percent has risen to 32 percent of the counties in this country having just one insurer offering plans on the Affordable Care Act exchange. There are five States this year that have only a single insurer offering ACA plans in their entire State--Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and And in nine States, there is only one insurer offering ACA plans in a majority of the[[Page S2101]]counties in the States: Tennessee, North Carolina, West Virginia, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, and  Next year, in 2018, we know the problem will be much worse. As more insurance companies announce their plans for the 2018 plan year, it is very likely that more counties across the Nation will face challenges similar to those in the Knoxville, Tennessee, area, where, again, having an ObamaCare subsidy will be as useful as having a bus ticket in a town with no buses running.  Now, there is a solution to this. As I mentioned, the legislation that Senator Corker and I are introducing will do three things: First, it will allow Americans to use their Affordable Care Act subsidy--the money they are getting now--to purchase any health insurance plan outside of the exchange, as long as the insurance is approved by the State for sale in the individual market. That means Americans on the exchanges will have options to purchase insurance where the Affordable Care Act has left them with none. This option will be given to individuals who live in the counties where the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that there are zero options on the ACA exchange.  Second, when the Secretary certifies that there are zero insurance options on the exchange, the legislation will waive the Affordable Care Act's requirement to buy a specific health plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four. The law's individual mandate, in other words, will not apply to these individuals. And, of course, it shouldn't. They shouldn't be penalized for not buying insurance when there is no insurance to buy.  The legislation's temporary authority would be in place only through the end of the 2019 plan year.  Third, I hope that this legislation will provide some peace of mind for those Knoxville area residents and Americans in counties across the country trapped in collapsing exchanges.  This is not a permanent solution. Congress has a responsibility to continue its work to solve this problem and to give more Americans more choices of lower cost health insurance.  Long term, Americans should have the freedom to make their own choices about their family's health care needs. But in the short term, we must act on behalf of 230,000 Tennesseans, some of the most vulnerable citizens in our State, and millions of other Americans in other States who are likely to have zero choices of insurance in 2018.  Earlier this afternoon, the Tennessee insurance commissioner, Julie Mix McPeak, who has testified before the Senate and made public statements that the Tennessee Affordable Care Act exchanges were in virtual collapse--what she means by that is no one will be selling insurance in them--issued this statement in support of the bill that Senator Corker and I have introduced. She said:       This bill ``would definitely be helpful for Tennessee      consumers. We are in favor of any legislation that improves      consumer choice and provides access for It is      completely unacceptable for our consumers to have a subsidy      but no ability to purchase insurance on the exchange. We      support any option that avoids that result.''  I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgS2100.txt,1695,CONDEMNING NORTH KOREA'S DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPLE INTERCONTINENTAL,2017.0,29.0,February
12416,topic-id,866,"Mr.President, in 2015, 85 U.Senators voted to fix the No Child Left Behind We reversed the trend to a national school board and began to restore decisions to classroom teachers, local school boards, and The Wall Street Journal said that it was ``the largest devolution of federal control to the States'' in 25 years.  The Department of Education regulation that we seek to overturn today does exactly the reverse. It begins to restore the national school board, and it begins to take away responsibility from classroom teachers, local school boards, and It does that in direct violation of the law we passed with 85 Senators voting for it 15 months ago.  The question before us today is not only whether we believe in a national school board or local school board, the question is whether we believe Congress ought to write the law or the U.Department of Education ought to write the law. Article I of the U.Constitution says that the U.Congress--we--should write the law.  The purpose of this resolution is to overturn a Department of Education regulation that in seven specific cases directly violates the Every Student Succeeds Act passed 15 months ago, and in 16 additional cases exceeds the authority allowed by the law. I spoke on this floor yesterday in detail of each of those 23 instances.  It is very unusual for the Congress to actually prohibit a department from regulating on an issue, but that is exactly what Congress did. The regulation we are seeking to overturn says to States: Ignore the law that 85 Senators passed 15 months ago. Ignore the law President Obama called a ``Christmas miracle.'' Ignore the law Governors, teachers, school boards, and superintendents all supported, and even ignore why they supported it, and listen instead to unelected bureaucrats at the U.Department of  This regulation issued by the Department of Education specifically does things or requires States to do things Congress said in our law that the Department cannot do; therefore, it violates the law.  For example, Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States what to do about fixing low-performing schools in Alaska or Tennessee or your State; that is a State decision. But this regulation does that anyway.  Congress said to the Department: You cannot tell States exactly how to rate the public schools. But this regulation does that anyway.  This isn't a trivial matter. The remarkable consensus that developed in 2015 in support of the bill fixing No Child Left Behind was, as I said earlier, to reverse the trend toward a national school board and restore to States, classrooms, teachers, and communities decisions about what to do about schools. People are fed up with Washington telling teachers and schools and superintendents and States so much about what to do about their children in 100,000 public schools. So this regulation, which contravenes the law, goes to the heart of that consensus.  This resolution ensures that the law is implemented the way Congress wrote it. This resolution restores flexibility. This resolution preserves local decision making. This resolution scuttles new and burdensome reporting requirements that are in the Department regulation. This resolution ensures strong accountability for our schools, but it is State accountability. That is what we decided in our law.  Chaos? My distinguished friend from Washington said ``chaos.'' The Secretary of Education has announced that States may continue to follow the exact same timeline that the former Secretary, Secretary King, announced for sending in their State plans. If they have questions about how to do that, they can read the law, they can read the guidance, they can read frequently asked questions, or they can make a telephone call.  This resolution does not in any way give the Secretary new authority. In fact, it limits her authority and the authority of the next If we stand up and say we are not going to allow any Secretary of Education, whether it is Secretary King or Secretary DeVos, to, in 23 different instances in a regulation, contravene the authority granted in a law, that means we won't have Secretaries imposing their own policies. We will have Congress writing the law. This regulation--the one we are overturning is not required by the law. It is allowed by the law, but it is not required by the law. School districts can read the law.  Future Secretaries will be able to write regulations on this subject. Of course they will. When you overturn a regulation, it does mean the Secretary can't issue a new regulation that is substantially the same, but that simply means, in a commonsense way, the Secretary can't turn right around and do the same thing we just overturned.  This is a question of whether we are going to restore the national school board that 85 Senators voted to reverse. This is a question of whether you believe Congress writes the law or the U.Department of Education writes the law. This resolution upholds the law that received 85 votes from U. I urge my colleagues to vote aye. An ``aye'' vote preserves the bipartisan[[Page S1714]]consensus. A ``nay'' vote undermines the bipartisan consensus.  I yield the floor.  I yield back any remaining time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1704-4.txt,1695,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,9.0,February
12316,topic-id,1164,"Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the confirmation of our colleague Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General of the United  I have great respect for Senator Sessions' long history of public service, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with him where we have found common ground. However, Senator Sessions and I have frequently and sometimes vehemently disagreed on important issues, including matters like civil rights and voting rights, hate crimes laws, immigration, and criminal justice reform.  I want to acknowledge that Senator Sessions' nomination is supported by many, including many in the law enforcement community in my home State of It is vital that the Attorney General have a good working relationship with the law enforcement community, and I have no doubt that Senator Sessions will be a strong voice for law enforcement, if he is confirmed.  But the role and the responsibility of our Attorney General is bigger than any one group. Our Attorney General must work on behalf of all The Department of Justice has a broad jurisdiction. So I have also heard from over 16,000 Wisconsinites who are opposed to his confirmation, many of whom expressed profound concerns about what it would mean for racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, including DREAMers, and others, were he to become our Attorney Hundreds of national civil and human rights organizations have expressed their opposition on similar grounds.  After reviewing his record, getting a chance to meet with him in my office, and considering everything that I have heard from my constituents, I simply do not believe that Senator Sessions is the right choice to be Attorney General of the United I have that belief for a number of reasons.  First, I am concerned that Senator Sessions will not be the independent[[Page S926]]champion for the rule of law that we need with Donald Trump in the White In any administration, the Attorney General's first duty is to the Constitution and to the people of the United This President has already issued a number of orders--legally questionable orders--including one affecting our visa and refugee programs that a number of Federal courts have already temporarily blocked. We need an Attorney General who will ensure that the President's actions do not run roughshod over protections guaranteed by our Nation's laws and I am not convinced that Senator Sessions will be that kind of Attorney  Second, I do not believe that Senator Sessions will be the champion of the civil rights of all Americans that an Attorney General must be. The Department of Justice plays a central role in enforcing our Nation's civil rights laws, from investigating hate crimes to safeguarding the right to vote, to fighting discrimination against women, racial and religious minorities, and people with disabilities. At a time when there has been a disturbing increase in hate-motivated crimes, discrimination, and harassment, including, particularly, against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, and people of the Muslim faith, it is even more important that the Department of Justice be strong and proactive.  I have heard from constituents in Wisconsin who have faced bigotry and hate-motivated speech in the wake of the election of Donald Among them is a family from Fitchburg, WI, with 11 adopted children, including children from Ghana and  This family received an anonymous letter proclaiming ``Trump won'' and calling them race traitors and telling them to go home. This and other reports from Wisconsinites and, frankly, from people throughout the United States breaks our hearts.  Senator Sessions fought against efforts to strengthen and make more inclusive Federal hate crimes laws and criticized voting rights laws as ``intrusive.'' He has shown hostility to the rights of LGBT individuals and attacked the reproductive health care rights of women.  Now more than ever we need a Justice Department that places a priority on enforcing our civil rights and voting rights laws, proactively combatting hate violence and fighting for the equality of all I am simply not convinced that Senator Sessions will be the champion vulnerable Americans need as Attorney General with an unflagging commitment to make our country a fairer and more equal place.  Third, I believe Senator Sessions will not take a fair or humane approach as Attorney General with regard to immigration. I was deeply troubled by candidate Trump's ugly and divisive rhetoric on immigration, and I am appalled by the actions that he has taken thus far as  Senator Sessions was one of his campaign's key advisers on immigration and has been a vocal opponent of bipartisan, comprehensive reforms that would address our broken immigration system.  The Department of Justice is responsible for adjudicating immigration cases and ensuring fairness and due process in the treatment of undocumented individuals and refugees.  The Department also plays a key role in our national security apparatus, helping to fight terrorism, and keeping the homeland safe.  The President's recent orders on immigration have furthered divisions, created chaos and confusion, proven to be legally and constitutionally questionable, and are inconsistent with core American values. In the opinion of many national security experts, they will make our Nation less safe, not more.  I simply do not believe that Senator Sessions, with his history of hostility to immigration and support for this President's approach, is the right person to lead the Department of Justice, as it discharges its critical duties on immigration and national security.  America has made great progress over the last 8 years with an administration that has taken seriously a shared responsibility to pass on to the next generation a country that is more equal, not less.  All Americans deserve a strong commitment from America's top law enforcement official to act on violence born out of hatred based on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other characteristic.  At a time when voting rights and the constitutional right of women to make their own health care decisions are under attack across our country, we need an Attorney General who will stay true to these constitutional freedoms and not be driven by politics.  For me, the vote on Senator Sessions' confirmation is a moral choice. I am guided by my strong belief that all Americans deserve equal opportunity and freedom to pursue their hopes and dreams. I cannot support this nomination for Senator Sessions to be Attorney General, and I urge my colleagues to oppose him.  Now I would like to take a moment to discuss what happened last night here on the Senate floor. Last night, the Republican leadership of this Chamber stopped one of my colleagues from reading the words of Coretta Scott  Coretta Scott King wrote a letter and a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee back in 1986, expressing her opposition to Jeff Sessions' nomination to serve as a Federal judge.  Coretta Scott King believed, as I do, that the right to vote is a fundamental right afforded to every It is a right that people have lost their lives seeking and defending.

12401,topic-id,1356,"Mr.President, thank you for allowing me to engage in this colloquy with my friend and colleague, Senator Blunt from Missouri, who has been a real leader not just in the Senate but when he was in the House, traveling to all of the hospitals in Missouri and talking about the issues that concern the people there, as I do in Wyoming every weekend, going home and talking to people at home.  You may not know this, but I was the president of the Wyoming Medical Society and worked with something as the medical director called the Wyoming Health Fairs, where we brought low-cost health screening to people all around the Cowboy I had been going to these health fairs for years--when I was a doctor practicing medicine, when I was an orthopedic surgeon, and then when I was in the State senate and now as a U.Senator, to the point that I was at a health fair last Saturday in Buffalo,  People come to the fairs. They get their blood tested ahead of time so they can come and pick up the results and find out about their cholesterol and thyroid conditions and other issues. There are booths from the Heart Association and the Diabetes Society, depression screenings, all sorts of things. People there are very interested in their health.  When they see me as a doctor and knowing I am also a Senator, they want to talk about how the healthcare laws affected their lives. What I hear, story after story, is, you have to repeal this Many of them are people who had insurance that worked for them before the healthcare law was passed. When the healthcare law was passed, they were basically told that what they had, which worked for them and which they could afford, wasn't good enough for the government. The government said: No, you have to buy something else, something more expensive and not what you really need or want--which is getting into the fundamental problem here.  ObamaCare is collapsing all around the country. In Wyoming, as in many places--and I know Senator Blunt is in a situation where he has people whom he works with--there is not really a marketplace out there. It is a monopoly. There is only one choice.  We see our colleagues--Senator Alexander in his home State and Senator Corker--in some counties, there are no choices. Nobody is going to sell on the exchange. Even with the ObamaCare government subsidies, there is nothing to be bought.  We have to act now. The House is in the process of doing that. I think they have made an incredible effort, a fundamental change, a big step away from It is a monumental shift. What it does is it eliminates the things I hear about every weekend in Wyoming that people don't like about the healthcare law. It is the mandates. It is the taxes. It is the penalties they have to pay. People don't like that. They don't like the government saying: You have to buy a government-approved product, pay for it, whether or not you want it, whether or not it works for you.  We eliminate all of those things in what the House is debating now. What do we preserve? We preserve things that people know are important for them. People with preexisting conditions will still be protected. My wife Bobbi is a breast cancer survivor. She has been through operations. She has been through chemotherapy, radiation. As a doctor and as a husband, I know how important it is to protect people with preexisting conditions. There is also a limit on lifetime payments for people who get sick. Finally, we do want to keep and we do preserve for families--they can keep younger members of their family on their insurance, to the age of 26.  We eliminate the things people don't like. We preserve the things that are still so important for families all around the country. We work to get to the point where people can afford health insurance again.  It is interesting listening to the Democrats talking about how many people have been covered under What you find out is that coverage is empty. They may have an insurance card, but if the copays are so high and the deductibles are so high--$5,000, $6,000, $7,000--it is unusable. They say: I have ObamaCare, but I don't have the ability to get the care.  The issue of Medicaid, which was a failed system for a long time--it has been 50 years since Medicaid came into existence. There is a lot we need to do to modernize, update, streamline, strengthen, improve Medicaid in ways that actually help people.  I was in the State senate. Mr.President, I know you have a long history of involvement in your home Senator Blunt does as well with the activities there. What we have seen with Medicaid--and I saw it in the State legislature--if we had the freedom and the flexibility in the State to make the decisions about how that money was spent rather than dealing with all of these rules and regulations and one-size-fits-all that comes out of Washington, we always felt we could do a much better job of providing for the people of our Let the State make involved decisions for people on Medicaid, and we could help a lot more people for the same amount of money. It seemed there was so much waste and abuse in the whole Medicaid system.[[Page S1706]]  So much of what the House is doing is to try to get the power out of The question is, Whom do you want in control? Do you want the government in control or the people, and their care and the decisions being made at home?  I come to the floor today to thank my colleague from Missouri for his leadership on this from the days before he was even in the U.Senate, from his days in the House, and for his involvement. He was really one of the leaders in the House before coming to the Senate on this whole topic. He knows it well. He visits with people at home in his home State, as I do at home in mine.  I will be at home in Wyoming again this weekend, traveling around the State with different activities. I think one of the things we all do when we go home is visit with people and find out where they are going to be and what is on their minds, and that is the best way to do it.  I will be at a pancake breakfast. I will be at a Boy Scout event. I will be at a dinner at the Rocky Mountain Elk I will visit with a number of high school students. You hear people. You want to be there and listen to what they have to say. So I am looking forward to being there again this weekend, as I was last weekend--in Buffalo last weekend for the health fair in Rawlins--for an event to hear how what Washington does impacts their lives.  What we have seen over the past 6 or 7 years since ObamaCare became law is that decisions being made in Washington hurt a lot of people in Wyoming, hurt people who were patients of mine when I was actively practicing as a surgeon. The regulations, the one-size-fits-all in terms of the impact on the hospitals, the healthcare providers, and the patients--we know these people need relief. They need to be rescued from this collapsing ObamaCare healthcare law. And we want to repair the damage. We can't get it all done overnight. It is not possible. It took us about 6\1/2\, 7 years to get to this point. President Trump has only been in office for about 7 weeks. You can't get it done overnight. We are making definite strides in the direction that is important for the country.  I wish to ask my friend and colleague Senator Blunt if he is seeing the same things in Missouri and hearing the same sorts of stories as we work to repeal and replace this healthcare law.

12403,topic-id,279,"I am hearing the exact same thing at home. The premiums in our State for people having to buy on the exchange have gone up double digits. I think we had the same thing happen in your State year after year, to the point where if you only have one company selling on the exchange in rural communities--for us, it is our whole That is a big problem.  The other thing we certainly are concerned about--and I know this is the case with both Senator Blunt and me--ours is a rural State, and huge areas of your State are rural.  The architect of ObamaCare, Ezekiel Emanuel from the University of Pennsylvania, said that we have too many hospitals in the United He said there are 5,000 hospitals, and he said there are about 1,000 too many. He actually wrote a book about this after they wrote the healthcare law, and he said that there are about 1,000 too many and they need to close.  Well, if you are in rural Wyoming or rural Missouri, those hospitals are a long way from other places. The first I think 80 hospitals have closed, and they were rural hospitals. Fortunately not in my State, but in a number of States, you have seen that--numbers of rural hospitals closing. When a rural hospital closes as a result of the Obama healthcare law, the impact on a community is dramatic in terms of it being able to recruit nurses, doctors, and businesses to the community, if there is not a hospital, and to recruit teachers to the schools. I don't know if that is an experience and concern the Senator is seeing around rural  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1704-4.txt,1881,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,February
12225,topic-id,1413,"Mr.President, even with all the dysfunction in Congress, somehow the American people continue to expect that Washington will enact policies that bear at least some relationship to the challenges they face. Unfortunately, the administration's new Executive order on energy fails even that low bar.  This order will not expand energy production, it will not make us more energy independent, it will not create more American jobs, and it will also not protect us from the ravages of climate change. That last point is somewhat less surprising than the first because, unlike millions of Americans and 99 percent of scientists, this administration does not believe that climate change is real or that humankind is contributing to it.[[Page S2102]]  To understand where this Executive order comes from, I think it is important to see where we were before this administration took office. Put simply, the United States was already on track to achieve energy independence. Our country is producing a tremendous amount of low-cost energy. Since 2008, solar energy production has grown more than 50-fold, wind power is up 3-fold, and oil production in the United States of America is up 75 percent. In fact, 5 years ago, we began producing more oil than we import.  You can see on this slide that over the period of time that the Obama administration was in office, oil production rose like this, and net imports have gone like this--an important fact considering our geopolitical situation in the world. We are also now producing so much natural gas that facilities that were built originally to import gas are now being reengineered to export gas from the United I, along with other people in this Chamber, have worked hard to try to make sure those facilities are expedited so we can get the benefit of that exported natural gas.  Even before President Trump rode to the rescue with his Executive order, the Wall Street Journal told us that exports of natural gas could more than double over the next 5 years, just based on what we are doing already. We are also using energy far more efficiently in our homes, our appliances, and our automobiles, which is why the administration's action to reverse higher fuel standards last week--well, I just would say, talk about a solution in search of a problem. That is one.  There is not a person in Colorado who said to me: Michael, do you know what we ought to do? We ought to reduce the fuel efficiency standards on automobiles. We ought to create a regulatory environment where the United States can't sell competitive automobiles in the world. Nobody has said that because not only are they concerned about climate, they are concerned that we lead the world when it comes to innovation. And that order, just like a budget that cuts the EPA by 30 percent, that targets the climate scientists at the EPA, that targets the satellites that are above our heads so that we can't see what is happening on our planet--this is all so we can perpetuate a willful view that climate change doesn't exist, and it is the same thing with this Executive order.  All of the trends that are in place right now--right before this administration took office--have combined to reduce our reliance on foreign energy in recent years, even as our economy has grown and average prices at the pump, because of the abundant supply, remain under $2.30. We are just a few years away from exporting as much oil and gas as we import. That is important for our country.  Colorado has been a huge part of America's growing energy independence and, by extension, our national security. That is because in many ways Colorado led the way in developing a commonsense approach to expanding energy production while ensuring clean air and a healthy planet. We brought environmentalists together with the oil and gas industry to develop one of the first State limits on methane pollution. It became a model for the country. We passed the first voter-led renewable energy standard in the Nation, which became a model for the country. We established our own limits on carbon pollution at the State level, and in this process we have created 13,000 renewable energy jobs, with wind jobs alone expected to triple by 2020. On average, these jobs pay over $50,000. This is not some Bolshevik experiment or some socialist experiment. These are manufacturing jobs in the United States of America, in Colorado, that would not be there if it hadn't been for the policy decisions that were made in this body and in other parts of Washington, DC, and the supply chain that goes along with those manufactured turbines is critically important to our economy. At the same time we were doing all that, we preserved over 56,000 oil and gas jobs, even as drilling has slowed because of, again, abundant supply, to say nothing of the jobs Colorado has created just because it is a place where other people would like to live. They want to come to Colorado, as they want to go to Nevada, because there is a high quality of life. There is a lot of sunshine in both places.  I am pleased to have the chance to work with the Senator from Nevada to make sure we not only extended the investment tax credit with respect to solar, but we put language in there together--Republicans and Democrats together--to create an idea that those credits would kick in at the beginning of construction, not having to wait until the end. That has made a big difference to our solar industry.  Long ago, the State of Colorado and, I would say, many other States have broken past the false choice between our economy and the environment. That is the course we have charted in Colorado, and if the President were serious about energy independence, he would support that approach. Instead, he is trying to undermine it with this new order. By undoing national standards for carbon pollution, the order threatens to undercut our thriving clean energy industry. There are 465 solar and wind businesses across our State supporting over $8 billion in investments. By retreating from the fight against climate change, the order recklessly endangers Colorado's $646 billion outdoor recreation industry, not to mention the health of our national forests that line the banks of some of the most vital watersheds in  As the President targets our environment and clean energy economy with this Executive order, he has dressed it up as something good for jobs, as he did during the campaign. Yesterday, the President stood before a group of coal miners and promised to ``cancel job-killing regulations'' and ``put our miners back to work.''  Just 2 weeks ago, I was on the Western Slope of Colorado, a region with a number of mining communities. These communities, some of whom have helped invent hydraulic fracture and directional drilling, know that their challenges have far more to do with low prices and competition from natural gas than from the They know that their way of life and the way of life of communities like theirs all across the United States require real solutions to help them grow and diversify their economies. These communities get it. They understand it, but the President clearly does not.  Just yesterday, the Wall Street Journal ran this article entitled ``Despite Trump Move on Climate Change, Utilities' Shift from Coal Is Set to Continue.'' According to the article, last year, power from coal plants fell while power from natural gas rose 35 percent. Nationwide major utilities are shedding coal and increasing natural gas and renewables. That is the reality of our energy market and of the global economy, but this administration, when it comes to energy and when it comes to climate, is not operating in reality. It is operating amongst political slogans. It is operating in the theater of the absurd, where policies have no relationship to problems, facts don't matter, and false promises to struggling Americans are just another political tactic to win a cable news cycle.  The American people deserve so much better. Colorado deserves so much better than that. That is why today I am introducing a bill alongside more than 30 Senators to rescind this disastrous order, protect American jobs, and preserve our path toward energy independence. The stakes could not be higher for our kids, our planet, and our economy. We cannot let this stand.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgS2100.txt,1965,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,29.0,February

We don't share the same view on this, but he is an important voice in the Senate, and I am glad that he is a colleague on the Education Committee in the  As a matter of fact, the other day I said that I wish the President had the sense to appoint him Education The kids whom I used to work for in the Denver Public Schools would have been very, very well served by him.  The President, of course, is entitled to choose his team, and that is partly[[Page S952]]what elections are about. The Attorney General, more than any other Cabinet official, must be the people's lawyer, an advocate for the rule of law above all else.  My office has received nearly 23,000 calls and emails opposing this nomination. Many of them I cannot read today on the floor for fear of violating the Senate rules. But it is clear from these comments that young Coloradans who came to the United States and know no other country but this country, who arrived here illegally, but, through no fault of their own, fear they will be deported back to a country they don't know--it is clear to me from the comments that I have received in these letters that Coloradans in the LGBTQ community fear that an Attorney General Sessions would turn a blind eye toward discrimination. It is clear from these comments that Senator Sessions has not earned the confidence of many Coloradans who may soon rely on him to protect their rights and to identify abuses of constitutional power. And Coloradans, many of whom I know, fought for equality and justice during the civil rights movement, and fear that it will turn back much of the progress we have made.  We have a disagreement about Senator Sessions' role before he came to the Senate, but the fundamental reason I object to his nomination as Attorney General is that he led the fight in 2013 against our bipartisan effort to reform the broken immigration system in the United And I sat here on this Senate floor night after night after night listening to the Senator use fear and inaccuracies to derail our best chance in years to fix this broken immigration system.  Now, in time, I have come to understand that people come to this floor and they don't always--they are not always accurate in what they say. Sometimes they don't mean to be accurate; sometimes they are just mistaken. That was the first time I had ever heard that kind of relentlessness, saying things that just weren't right. I am being careful with my language because of last night's ruling.  He claimed that our bill--and, by the way, that bill, unlike almost anything that has happened in this place in the 8 years that I have been here--started out as a bipartisan effort, four Democrats and four Republicans working together for 7 or 8 months in a room trying to solve each other's issues.  There is a lot about the Senate today that the American people should not and cannot be proud of, and I will come to that in a minute. But as to the work of the Gang of 8, I would have been happy for people to have seen what happened behind closed doors in those 7 months. It is how the Senate ought to operate. It went to the Judiciary Committee where Democrats and Republicans together amended the legislation. They made it better. And then it came to the floor of the Senate and we had more amendments, and it passed with 68 votes.  It still hasn't passed the It has never even gotten a vote on the floor of the House of  Senator Sessions claimed during that debate that our bill would have ``dramatically increased incidence of criminal alien violence, officially legalizing dangerous offenders, while handcuffing immigration officers from doing their jobs.''  He claimed it would have legalized ``thousands of dangerous criminals while making it more difficult for our officers to identify public safety and national security threats.''  Senator Sessions claimed our bill would lead to a ``huge increase in immigration,'' invite a flood of immigrants into our Nation who would steal jobs from ``struggling American workers.''  These claims are demonstrably untrue. If our bill had become law, we would have secured our borders, we would have bolstered internal security, we would have better protected American workers, and we would have strengthened our economy.  Contrary to his characterization of what was in that bill, the 2013 bill provided far greater security than President Trump's plan.  The first two words in the title of that bill were ``border security.'' That has been completely ignored by the critics. It has been completely ignored by people who want to make an issue out of this in national campaigns. But the reality is it provided billions of dollars toward new technologies to monitor the border. It called for the building of a 700-mile fence. By the way, none of the rest of it would come to pass until we took care of the border.  Nearly 20,000 new Border Patrol agents--four times more than ordered by President Trump and double the current number--and not paid for by raising taxes on the American people at our border with Mexico, not paid for in a way that would destroy our trading relationship with Mexico, but paid for by fees that people were paying as they were becoming lawful in the United States of It had protections in the bill for American workers to ensure that employers hired American labor first. I know he objected to this, and I understand we had a difference of opinion, but the bill included a tough but fair path to citizenship, requiring people to go through background checks as part of a long path to citizenship.  During the Presidential campaign, Senator Sessions advised President-Elect, now-President Trump on immigration policy. In fact, my understanding is the President's immigration Executive orders--including one being challenged in court--mirror Senator Sessions' positions. These positions are antithetical to our history, to our values, to whom we are as a country.  Last Friday was the highlight of my year. I got on a plane and I left Washington--that was pretty good in and of itself--to go home to On Friday, I went to Dunn Elementary School in Fort Collins, CO, where Kara Roth's fifth grade class welcomed 26 new Americans from 13 countries to the United It is an International Baccalaureate program in this elementary school.

12344,topic-id,871,"The Denver Post editorialized yesterday, stating the obvious horrible truth here:       American journalists have been killed reporting on      terrorists. They've been beheaded. . . . To suggest that some      kind of shared bias exists throughout American newsrooms so      strong that it compels journalists to hide truth and thereby      endanger the public is as dangerous as it is demonstrably      untrue.  That is right. It is dangerous. It is dangerous for the leader of the free world to be saying that journalists are crooks; that the facts they are publishing in newspapers and online are untrue when they are true. It is dangerous when we are engaged in an experiment of self-government that goes back about 240 years to the founding of this country to refute things that are absolutely true as false and to claim that the reason they are being raised is because people lack integrity; that journalism is all about false news.  The White House put out a list of, I think it was in the seventies, of terrorist attacks they claim had never been reported, and newspaper after newspaper after newspaper had to run lists of the events that the White House described as unreported and then have links to the stories in their own newspapers and other newspapers that had reported on terrorists. As the Denver Post noted, and it is worth remembering this, there are journalists who have lost their lives trying to cover this story to have us better understand what is happening in the Middle East, what the threat of terror looks like, and have been beheaded on television because they took that risk.  With respect to the judges, for years it has been so painful around here to get anybody confirmed. I see these folks who are lawyers who have to put their law practice on hold for something that should be the greatest reflection of achievement of their life, being appointed to a Federal district court in this country, and who wait and wait and wait because of the unconscionable delay and disputes and partisan bickering that happens here instead of getting people on the court to do the job that they need to do.  Now we are going to be in the business of accusing judges and the judiciary of being crooked, of not following the law, of just playing politics. I think it is really important for us--not just Democrats but also Republicans--and I know my colleague is here from I wish to say in this body how much I appreciated his comments last night. He may not appreciate that I am saying that, but I appreciate his comments because a lot of what he said I completely agree with.  I know it has become fashionable to tear down rather than work to improve the democratic institutions which generations of Americans have built. This place didn't get here by accident. It is not a fluke. The Founding Fathers would be shocked--shocked--to know this Republic still exists. They would be proud. I think they would be proud of the progress we have made, but they would be shocked, at the time they were compromising with one another--slave owners and abolitionists, compromising to create this Republic that had never existed in an expanse as big as the Thirteen Colonies geographically or with as many people in the Thirteen Colonies geographically--for them to see this about 240 years later from coast to coast, 330 million people, the strongest military on the planet, the strongest economy on the planet, a place where people want to come--just as my mother and her parents came--to build opportunity for the next generation. That is incredibly special in the history of humankind. As I think my colleague from Florida was saying last night, we need to treat it with a little more care.  I am not just talking about the I am talking about our responsibility to provide oversight for this administration. I am talking about the importance for us to set an example for the children I saw last Friday at the naturalization ceremony, just as they are setting an example for us.

There are a lot of people here and around the world who are counting on us to pull ourselves together and start making this place work.[[Page S954]]  I will finish by saying that I think in this world of social media, it is also critically important for us to remember the importance of edited content and the work that journalists do.

12409,topic-id,1766,"Thank you, Mr. Last week, in his address to Congress, President Trump called education ``the civil rights issue of our time.'' I completely agree with that.  Millions of American kids are trapped in underperforming schools with little hope of gaining the skills needed for good-paying jobs in the 21st century economy. In America, poor kids hear 30 million fewer words than their more affluent peers by the time they get to kindergarten. If you don't think that makes a difference, you ought to talk to any kindergarten teacher in  By the fourth grade, only one in four kids in the United States can do math[[Page S1710]]at grade level, and even fewer than that can read at grade level in this country. About 9 in 100 are going to receive a college degree or its equivalent by the time they get to the age of 25.  As a Nation, we are falling behind the rest of the world. American 15-year-olds rank 15th in reading in the world, 19th in science in the world, and 37th in math in the world. These numbers are shameful. They are a national disgrace. Because these results fall mainly on communities of color in this country, this is a civil rights crisis in the United States--as the President said, the civil rights issue of our time.  It is for those reasons and other reasons that Congress passed No Child Left Behind in 2001, so as to strengthen the accountability and transparency for public education all over this country. Despite its good intentions, the law came with onerous requirements that did not work for many communities, including my own.  When I was the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, there were few experiences more miserable than dealing with the Federal bureaucracy and their auditors, who would make judgments that were driven more by compliance than by the needs of our children. Somebody who understood that well was Margaret Spellings, who was, at that time, the Secretary of Education for this country. We owe her a debt of gratitude for the work that she did as I, personally, owe her a debt of gratitude for the waivers she granted to the Denver Public Schools, when I was superintendent, to allow us to focus not on the compliance of rules that made no sense but to focus on the kids in this school district.  I know that was the experience of educators all over America, which is why, in 2015, the Senate came together--and I am a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--to replace No Child Left Finally, 8 years too late--8 years after it was supposed to be reauthorized--under the leadership of Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray, we were able to pass the Every Student Succeeds The bill earned overwhelming support. The country was ready for a change.  The law brought much needed reform to the Federal Government's role in education by giving States far more flexibility for innovation, while preserving important, core accountability protections, which are critical for those of us who are interested in the civil rights mission of the Federal It was a rare example of bipartisan cooperation and smart policymaking in Washington, In fact, I cannot think of another case in which we received that much bipartisan support on such a difficult issue in the time that I have been here.  The way I see it--and I say this as a parent of three children in the public schools in Denver and as a former school superintendent--the only reason for Washington to be involved at all in public education is with regard to civil rights, and that is an important reason for us to be involved. All kids should have access to great schools regardless of where they live, what ZIP Codes they are born into, or who their parents are.  With Every Student Succeeds, the new bill, States will design their own accountability systems and interventions when schools struggle. That is a big change from No Child Left It is a welcome change. The law shifts enormous responsibility from the Federal Government to States and transforms over 15 years of education policy. The law is not perfect, but it represents one of the most significant changes and, I would say, importantly, one of the most significant retrenchments of the Federal Government in domestic policy in modern American history. That should be acknowledged. It should be welcomed.  As States shift to the new model, many are asking for clarification about how to implement the law and make the most of greater State control over education. That is why the Department of Education issued rules last year to provide much needed clarity, stability, and flexibility to States, making it easier for them to transition from the broken system that we had under No Child Left Behind to the newer and more State-driven approach that we now have.  Now some in Congress have targeted this regulation. They have invoked the Congressional Review Act to repeal the rules wholesale. That would be so foolish after the progress we have made and the direction in which we have headed. It would tie the hands of the Department of Education from properly implementing the law and delay much needed flexibility and accountability for the It would be a disservice to students, to educators, to teachers, and to principals all across the country, and it would undermine the implementation of the entire law.  As I have said many times--and I have learned this the hard way--when it comes to education policy in particular, bad implementation can be just as harmful--even more harmful--than bad policy.  Repealing the rules would also sow confusion among States about when they must comply with this new law. The Every Student Succeeds Act includes a timeline for transition so that States have time to plan, but many specifics of that transition are unclear. The Department of Education's rules clarify that timeline and give States the flexibility with which to implement some parts of the law later than others.  Why would we want to take that away? Repealing the regulation would throw all of that away. Will schools have to fully comply with all aspects of the law by 2018, or is there some flexibility to stagger its implementation?  Beyond the timeline, striking the regulation wholesale would also throw States into limbo by creating uncertainty over other important parts of the law. For example, the act includes a major change in how the law applies to English learners, which is one of the fastest growing populations in our schools throughout the country and now represents nearly 1 out of 10 students nationwide. In the new law, many provisions concerning English learners moved from title III to title  As States undertake this shift, they need clarity on how to design accountability systems that include English learners in order to ensure kids do not fall through the cracks. For example, the rules make it clear that States can create proficiency goals for different groups of English learners rather than creating a uniform goal for all students.  Striking the rules would also undermine core elements of the law, like the requirement for States to report on school spending and resources. The regulation clarifies that States must create a uniform procedure for this reporting, which is vital for transparency around funding and investments and, I would say, is vital with respect to the civil rights mission of this law.  It is easy to publish numbers. Believe me; I have seen it. It is a lot harder to publish numbers that are accurate and meaningful by which parents and kids can make informed decisions.  Right now, as we sit here, States are developing accountability plans under the Every Student Succeeds Act, and they are drawing on the current rules to guide that process. A change now could delay the submission and approval process for these plans. States will not know whether to use different templates or the ones they already have. They do not know if they have to restart public comment periods, delaying submissions and throwing the entire timeline into uncertainty. There is no reason we should be doing this to our schools, our teachers, and our principals.  Repealing the rules would also suppress innovation and limit flexibility. I know that is the clarion call on this floor a lot of the time. In this case, people are going to get the opposite of what they expect. Flexibility is central to the Every Student Succeeds I fought for many aspects of the law in order to give States the ability to design their own accountability systems, and I believe in that. Yet, in the absence of express, legally binding guidance from the Department of Education about where and how they can experiment, States will respond to that uncertainty by embracing the safest course. I saw that all the time when I was superintendent.  States stand to lose a lot of money if they are not in compliance, particularly $15 billion in annual title I funds for students who live in poverty. They do not want to risk it. It may seem odd, but we need these rules in order to ensure flexibility and innovation for Nonbinding guidance is not enough.[[Page S1711]]  Finally, if we use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule--a very, very blunt instrument--the Department of Education will not be able to publish any rule that is ``substantially the same'' unless the Congress passes a new law--the Congress that took 8 years longer than it was supposed to in order to reauthorize No Child Left Behind the last time. This could mean that the Department of Education--and this is something people here need to pay attention to if they care about civil rights--would not be able to issue any new regulation to provide clarity for States as they transition to the new law. They would be left completely in the lurch, potentially hamstringing education policy across the country for a decade.  What is a shame about it is that there is absolutely no reason to do this. If the rules need to be changed, we should work together to improve them, but a CRA is not the correct policy tool. That is especially true when passing it would prevent all future regulation on core aspects of the Every Student Succeeds  There has to be a better way for us to come together than this. I agree with the President that education is the civil rights issue of our time, and we should defeat this vote on this  I yield the floor.

12471,topic-id,693,"Mr.Speaker, like many people, I have noticed renewed interest in the 25th Amendment, as we have seen erratic behavior out of the White House, an inability of Donald Trump to even tell whether it rained on him during his inaugural speech, and repeating false statements that are demonstrably wrong.  Last Friday, the mechanism to deal with Presidential incapacity, the 25th Amendment, celebrated its 50th anniversary. I became intrigued with its history and application because it is clear, whether with Donald Trump or a future President, this mechanism is very important. Accidents can happen: President Reagan suffered from early onset Alzheimer's that concerned his staff. President Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke, and his wife, Edith, effectively governed the United States for months.  It is only a matter of time before we face these challenges again. As I examined the amendment, it became clear that, in the case of mental or emotional incapacity, there is a glaring flaw. For a mentally unstable, paranoid, or delusional President, the 25th Amendment has no guarantee of its application. In fact, it is likely that it would fail.  As written, the 25th Amendment requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to concur that the President is no longer capable of exercising authority. There are other safeguards. It would take time to process. Ultimately, two-thirds of both Houses of Congress must agree.  But look at the current Even if one thinks that a group with no meaningful government experience, all approved in a heightened partisan context, most of whom don't even know the President personally, could objectively exercise the power should the President become mentally incapacitated, the larger question is whether they would ever be allowed to do so.  A President who is paranoid or delusional is very unlikely to tolerate dissent within the ranks. He or she could simply fire any Cabinet member who would stand up to them.  That is why we need to exercise the other part of the 25th Amendment that allows Congress to designate another body, instead of the Who could exercise that authority with the confidence of the American public and with the knowledge of what it takes to understand the personal and political stresses of the Presidency?  I submit that the best failsafe to a President who is emotionally unstable would be to impanel our previous Presidents and Vice Presidents to make that determination.  Think about how it would work. Currently, there are 10 bipartisan former distinguished Americans who, in most cases, enjoy even greater public support than when they left office. Most importantly, there is no group of people better suited to evaluate the evidence and the dynamics at work for the good of the country and the President who needs help.  Now, we have made real progress with mental illness. We have made it easier to get care. We are taking away the stigma for the one in five Americans who suffer from mental health issues. We find people to be more open and candid and accepting of themselves and others. We are making real strides in terms of treatment and acceptance.  But all of this requires access to help; and this drama should not play out with somebody whose fingers are on the nuclear buttons and whose every pronouncement can unsettle diplomatic conditions, affect war and peace, and the global economy.  Having Congress establish this panel of former Presidents and Vice Presidents from both parties as a guardian and failsafe mechanism is important, and it needs to happen as soon as possible.  We never know when catastrophe might strike. There is no good time to fix this problem. In today's world of alternative facts and fake news, in a sea of bitter partisan controversy, we need to have a mechanism that can be reliable, command public confidence, and be above politics.  It is hard to think of a group that would collectively have more support and credibility than the distinguished[[Page H1188]]Americans who have been in that position and, regardless of partisan differences, whose allegiance to America is unquestioned.

In fact, somebody observed this week that you have to go back to the very founding of the government, to the first administration of George Washington, to find a time when it has taken longer to put a Cabinet in place, and George Washington only had to find four people in a government that was just trying to establish itself. But we are taking a maximum amount of time on a Cabinet and a Presidential nomination that usually happen quickly.  There has traditionally been an understanding in our country that when the President is elected--the importance of the President being able to put his stamp on the government as quickly as possible. And eventually we will be able to say his or her stamp on the government. But up until now, Presidents have had that opportunity. I read somewhere that from President Garfield right after the Civil War through Franklin Roosevelt, that Cabinets--those were put in place in the first days of every one of those administrations, often even the very first day.  What we have seen in this debate is also the questioning of people's motives, not just their decisions. I don't quote Vice President Biden often, but one of the quotes I have heard him give often and one I have agreed with in all my time here is that it is appropriate to question somebody else's decisions in public debate, particularly when you are debating your colleagues, who have also been elected to these jobs as well, but it is frankly not appropriate to question their motives. When we start doing that, that is always a mistake.

He and I have not always voted the same. In fact, there is probably no Member here with whom I have always voted the same. But he comes with a background of integrity.  He started as an Eagle I think he was a Distinguished Eagle I am not even sure I know the difference between an Eagle Scout and a Distinguished Eagle Scout; I thought all Eagle Scouts were distinguished. But starting even then, Jeff Sessions has always stood out a little above the crowd.  He has four decades of public service. In 1975, he became an assistant U.attorney in the Southern District in Half a dozen years after that, he became the U.attorney in that district. He held that job for 12 years until he became the attorney general of People trusted him to take that those responsibilities. In 1997, as I said, he came to the  He has been a senior member of the Judiciary Committee for some time now. He has worked across party lines, and he has done that in fights for justice and fights on behalf of the victims of crime and, frankly, on more than one occasion, fights to be sure that those accused of crimes also had their day in court, and after they had their day in court, it was Senator Sessions who was instrumental in leading the fight for the Fair Sentencing  Senator Sessions was very involved in the Paul Coverdell act for forensic sciences to be sure that the evidence that was in court would be unassailable to every extent possible. He has been vigorous in wanting to be sure those accused of crimes had justice, as well as those who were the victims of crime.  When I came to the Senate, Senator Coons and I--a Democrat from Delaware and a good friend of mine. I am thinking about him in this week that his father passed away. When we came to the Senate 6 years ago, we formed the Law Enforcement Senator Sessions was a great supporter of that effort.  When we were able to reauthorize in the last Congress the Victims of Child Abuse Act--this is a law that provides Federal assistance to locations in virtually every State--22 in the State of Missouri--where kids who have been the victims of crime or a witness to crime have a place to go and get the information out of their lives that needs to get away from them so they can get on to the next thing that happens, a law that protects our most vulnerable children and is designed to hold the perpetrators of crimes on those children or crimes those children witness--allows that to be dealt with in the right way. Senator Sessions was a great advocate for that.  He has been endorsed by the major law enforcement associations of the country, as well as many of his colleagues. The law enforcement associations that say Jeff Sessions would be a good Attorney General are the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Major Counties Sheriffs' Association, and the list goes on.  Then you get to the victims of crime groups who have endorsed Senator  Five former U.Attorney Generals and one former FBI Director are on that list. They are saying that Jeff Sessions would be a good person--in the case of five of them--to hold the jobs they held, and they know more about that job than any of us do: Michael Mukasey, Alberto Gonzales, John Ashcroft, Bill Barr, Ed Meese All, along with FBI Director Louis Freeh, have endorsed Jeff Sessions for this job.  There has been some discussions of his relationship with African We have African-American endorsements from his State but also from the former Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice; our colleague Tim Scott, who will be here later this afternoon, and I intend to be here for his remarks; and Larry Thompson, the former Deputy Attorney These are people who know Jeff Sessions and know what he has to offer to that job.  It is a job of great responsibility. Seldom will we as Senators have an opportunity to confirm someone to that job or any other job that we know as well as Senator We know his family. We know his recent addition of twin grandchildren to his family just a little over a year ago. We know how much he cares about them. We know the moments that he has reached out to each of us as we have had challenges or things we needed help with.  I think he will do a great job as Attorney I believe that will happen later today. I think the country and the Attorney General's office will be in good hands late today when Jeff Sessions undoubtedly, I am confident, becomes the Attorney  I look forward to that vote later today and then getting on to the next nominee, Price, whom I served with in the Any discussion that there have not been ideas that were alternatives to the Affordable Care Act--people just have not been paying attention to Tom Price all the time he has been in the Congress or as budget director and haven't paid attention to him as a practicing physician. He is another great nominee at a time when we really need to set a new course.  We are going to see that happen in both the Attorney General's office and at HHS, and I look forward to what we do as those move forward.  I also look forward to what may not be the official maiden speech but what I think will be the first speech on the floor for our new colleague, John  I yield the floor.

12402,topic-id,159,"I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his efforts on this topic from the time we were both explaining why we thought President Obama's plan wouldn't work. What I see and I think what you mentioned you see is that people who have coverage often don't have access. It doesn't matter if you have coverage if there is nowhere to go or you feel like there is nowhere to go. I continually hear that from people who have the high-deductible policies. That means they are discouraged from spending the first $6,000 or $8,000 that is out-of-pocket spending.  Many people I talk to say they have not only more expensive coverage than they had before but less coverage than they had before and are reluctant to spend the out-of-pocket dollars that used to be covered by the insurance that didn't meet the new standards but met their family needs. I am wondering if the Senator is seeing that same thing.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgS1704-4.txt,1464,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,9.0,February
12404,topic-id,2636,"It is.  Mr.President, I think you are seeing that too. The critical needs hospitals, the critical access hospitals--the only hospitals available--are often also hospitals that disproportionately have people who are not insured or people who are of low income who aren't on any government program. What has happened in those hospitals and in the ones that have been able to stay open is that they have often had to go outside the traditional community support they had and associate with a bigger hospital.  That may turn out to have been a good thing, but one of the basics of the President's healthcare plan was--which we now know is a highly unlikely result--that everybody will have coverage. In a world where everybody has coverage, you don't have the disproportionate share of problems that inner-city hospitals, like the Truman Hospital in Kansas City, MO, have, or rural hospitals, like the dozen-plus that we have in our State that are critical needs hospitals. Those things don't happen. If this had worked the way the President thought it would work--and Democrats, when they, all on their own, passed this bill 7 years ago--we wouldn't be having the problems we see now: the havoc in our healthcare system--leaving Missourians, people from Alabama, people from Wyoming, people from all over the country with higher costs, with fewer options, and with more uncertainty.  How many times did the President say, when he was supporting this just after the election and during his election 8 years ago--President Obama kept making the case--that Americans would be able to keep the plans they like. They would be able to keep the doctors they like. Now we act as if those pledges--well, everybody knows--couldn't happen.  When the bill was passed, everybody said that was what would happen. Remember this: If you have a doctor you like, you will be able to keep the doctor you like, period. If you have an insurance plan you like, you will be able to keep the insurance plan you like, period. The period should have at least been a question mark.  As it turned out, it was not true. People didn't get to do that. According to the advocates of the law we have now, there would be more choices, there would be more competition, and there would be lower costs, and none of those things happened. Those things just did not happen.  In Missouri, several insurers have totally pulled out of the individual market. We have 115 counties. Last year, they all had at least two companies willing to offer insurance. This year, we have 97 counties where only one company is willing to offer insurance. I have always thought we needed to expand that insurance marketplace, not reduce it--and buying across State lines and buying an insurance product you thought met the needs of you and your family, rather than the needs somebody at the Department of Health and Human Services thought they knew was better for your family, rather than what you would know was better for your family. But instead, we have done just the opposite. Instead of expanding the marketplace, expanding choices--somehow ObamaCare was designed in a way that actually prevents this--instead of being able to buy across State lines, now you can't buy across county lines. We have 97 of our 115 counties where only one insurance company is willing to be part of the process on the individual market. That one insurance company, rightly, was able to go and say: Here is what we are going to charge. If you don't want to accept that, State insurance regulator, we won't offer the product.  Families one year to the next are often facing 40 percent increases. I[[Page S1707]]think the average is a 25-percent increase year over year. Many people are paying more than 100 percent, double what they paid when this started. The rate hikes have gone up and the coverage has gone down.  The average deductible in the bronze plan, the third plan down, is $6,000 for an individual and $12,000 for a family. That is before anybody helps you at all. So you have insurance that you are paying for every month, but if you get sick, you have to pay $6,000 for each individual and more than twice that if two people in your family have healthcare problems before anybody does anything. For most families in our country, and certainly most families in Missouri, that is like not having insurance at all.  Even in the silver plan, the average deductible is $3,500. That is an increase of 15 percent of the deductible over last year. Every year, the price goes up and the deductible goes up. All of us hear from families, individuals, and businesses who say: We can't continue to do this. Mark from Blue Springs told me: ``There is nothing affordable'' about the Affordable Care When it comes to what he and his family are facing, he said that before ObamaCare, they paid $246 a month to cover five people with coverage they thought met their needs. Now the premium is $800 a month. There are only three people. Only one child and he and his wife are still at home. For five people, they were paying $246 a month. Now they are paying $800 a month. He says:       These days, when we go to the doctor, nothing is covered.      We still have to pay for that visit 100 percent out of      pocket. In other words, we pay $800 per month only to be told      that none of the office visit or procedure is covered until      the $8,000 deductible is met.  He says: Really, what are we going to do? They have taken insurance away from us, and the promise that was made over and over was never kept.  Dave, a small business owner in Columbia, says his premiums have more than doubled at the same time that his business has been forced to continually raise deductibles and seriously reduce benefits so that people could continue to have insurance at work. As he puts it, President Obama's healthcare plan ``is far from affordable.''  Let's see. That is exactly what Mark said: There is nothing affordable about the Affordable Care And Dave's increase this year over last year was 40 percent. At some point, Dave and lots of other employers are deciding that this isn't working.  We have a group in our State that many other States have, the Older Adults Transportation It is a nonprofit that provides transportation services for older adults. The title is actually pretty descriptive of what they do. The cost has gone up over half a million dollars. The paperwork is ``so complex and so cumbersome,'' the executive director told me, that they have to spend additional money to hire a consultant just to fill out the forms to have the insurance they used to have. Then the insurance doesn't keep up with what they need and what their drivers need. They have to begin to cut services back to have insurance that even begins to resemble what they had before the Affordable Care Talk about people being left out. There are older adults in Missouri who don't have the same access to transportation they had before the Affordable Care  President Trump, in his address to the Congress just a few days ago, reiterated his commitment to step-by-step healthcare reforms ``that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.''  I was encouraged that he decided to back the expansion of health savings accounts. That allows everybody in the country to put more of their pretax dollars into portable health savings accounts that go with them wherever they go from job to job. You still have that health savings account. The plan that the House of Representatives is debating right now expands the way you can use that health savings account, as well as expands how much money you can put into that account.  Most importantly, the President reaffirmed the need to ensure coverage for all preexisting conditions. I have always supported providing insurance options for people who have preexisting conditions. I sponsored the legislation that allowed young people to stay on their parents' healthcare until they were 25. The people drafting the Affordable Care Act put exactly that language in the bill and raised the age to 26. Three million people every year have access to insurance because of a simple choice like that. I think that bill was four pages, with lots of white space, and 3 million people get insurance every year who wouldn't have insurance otherwise, or at least traditionally hadn't had insurance otherwise at no cost to taxpayers. Frankly, there is not much cost to anybody because those young, healthy people are just establishing themselves, just leaving home, just going off mom and dad's insurance, and they thought they could get by without it for a while. In all likelihood, they were right. They are not a hard group to insure.  That is the kind of thing we ought to think about, where we figure out how to increase access to coverage without taxpayers having to bear the load for somebody else's healthcare, if there is another way to do it. We want to be sure that, whether it is keeping them on your family insurance, staying on your family insurance longer, or having no lifetime cap--that was a legitimate problem that many people faced--they would have their insurance. They would pay for it forever, and then when they faced a catastrophic situation, at some point the insurance companies in earlier times were able to say: You reached your lifetime cap; so we are now canceling your policy. That wouldn't happen under the plan we are discussing.  The landscape for healthcare--and what families and individuals have to deal with--has dramatically changed. Because of that, it is going to be more challenging to go forward than it would have if we had done the same half-dozen commonsense things just a few years ago. This is no 2,700-page response or substitute for the 2,700-page ObamaCare bill.  This is an easily understood way to go forward that eliminates taxes that everybody is now paying on their healthcare. There is a medical device tax. There is an over-the-counter medication tax for things you don't have a prescription for. There is a special tax on those over-the-counter medicines in the current law. Those will be repealed. The medical device tax would be gone, would be phased out. The over-the-counter tax on medicines would be phased out and the tax on prescription drugs. If you buy over the counter, you pay a tax, but if you get a prescription, you also pay a tax. There may be a place in here where you pay a tax for just paying a tax. But the medical device tax is gone. The over-the-counter medication tax is gone. The tax on prescription drugs would be gone. The tax on health insurance policies would be gone. When you get health insurance, there is a tax to be paid under ObamaCare on that, as well. The Medicare tax increase would be gone. The tanning bed tax would be gone. The net investment tax would be gone. The health insurance tax would be gone. It is about a trillion dollars in taxes that were added back into the system. By the way, if you have some kind of coverage for a medical device, you are paying for the coverage. You are paying a tax on the coverage, if you are lucky enough that the medical device is covered, if your insurance company pays that. Of course, they pay the tax on that, and, then, you have paid it in the premium that you had to pay to cover the tax. We have to step back here and try to do the right thing.  My friend from Illinois earlier mentioned that there traditionally were five different community ratings of people of different ages based on the healthcare costs that they might have, but the ObamaCare bill said: No, you can only have three ratings. The oldest, sickest, most likely to use health coverage can't pay more than three times what the youngest, healthiest people pay, which is another reason, if you are young and healthy, not to get insurance.  Things that were put into this raised costs for so many people. Then what happens? Then people say: Well, why is it that we don't have enough people covered? They say: The real problem with ObamaCare is that there weren't enough young, healthy people who bought coverage on their own. It was designed into the plan to make it very unattractive, if you are young and healthy, to buy coverage because suddenly coverage for that population was in relationship to all other people[[Page S1708]]being covered, higher than it had ever been before.  With the bill the House is debating now, we would restore the disproportionate share payments to inner-city hospitals, to rural hospitals, where you have to treat more people who are either on a government program that doesn't pay very well or more people who don't have any coverage at all. That was eliminated in  We now realize that world is a world that doesn't exist, a world in which everybody who goes to the hospital, everybody who goes to see the doctor, everybody who seeks healthcare has insurance coverage.  Who takes care of that?  This bill, being debated right now in the House, looks at that again and says: Let's get back to where we are actually helping those institutions that are particularly focused on underserved populations, that are particularly focused on doing that.  We have an opportunity here, basically in three different steps, to do what needs to be done. The first two steps are critical. One is to set an end date for the chaotic situation we are in now, to do as much as we can with budget tools to set a framework for how we move on and get out of these incredibly devastating budget situations for both the Federal Government and for families. The second is to let the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who was confirmed by the Senate just a few weeks ago, look at the over 1,400 times in ObamaCare where that Department can create regulations that either make it harder or make it easier for people to comply with the law. One of the most important decisions, if you are an insurance company and you are offering a healthcare product, is deciding what classifies as an acceptable product, what is the basic criteria you can offer people and still be offering healthcare insurance. So we are at an important moment.  There is no doubt that the current situation is collapsing, that healthcare providers are providing healthcare to people who don't have coverage, who are not protected by programs they were previously protected by. The people who used to have a lot of choices in insurance, in many cases, now have only one choice, and it is not a choice they can afford, and when they do pay for it, they feel like they are living without insurance at all.  So we are doing what needs to be done. We have to do what we can to get back to where people can buy the insurance they think meets their needs, insurance they can afford and enables them to see the doctor they want to see. A patient-centered system, instead of a government-centered system, is the answer here. We have to get this job done, and I believe we will.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Dewey and Virginia Riehn have both held significant leadership roles within the veterans' community, and their decision to turn over that role to the next generation will be felt by the numerous lives they have impacted.

12266,topic-id,2282,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to continue the dialogue of the conversation about the candidate, the nominee for Attorney I rise to join my colleagues in opposition to the nomination.  I witnessed earlier tonight something that greatly disappointed me. One of my colleagues, as was mentioned earlier, stood up to read into the Record a letter, as we just saw, that has been a part of the record of this body for decades--to read that letter into the That was then stopped through the Chair because it was said to impugn another sitting  As Chuck Schumer said, that is selective enforcement, but to me there is that going on and a lot more.  I used to preside in the first months I was in the U.Senate and sat and listened to the speeches of many of my colleagues. I have to say, I am proud to be a Member of the body, where folks on both sides comport themselves with a level of comity that is admirable.  I heard some people tonight decry the descending of this body into unfortunate places, but the reality is, my experience has been, on the whole, very positive. The respect and the collegiality here is something that makes this place incredibly valuable to work. Though the public might not see it, there are a lot of bills that get worked on together and even get to the floor, many of them get votes, many of them get passed. I am proud to have passed many of those bills with my colleagues, colleagues whom I don't just consider colleagues; frankly, I consider them friends.  But within that context, I have to say I have watched when I sat in the Chair and had to listen many times when people said things that made me feel they were unfortunate. I watched the President of the United States talk about his character and his motives in ways that I thought were disparaging, but amidst all of this, in my 3 years, I have never seen someone stopped from speaking on the Senate floor when, as the Democratic leader said so clearly, there could have been many other times where that rule was used, and that is a frustration.  But what makes it more of a frustration is the context in which it happened tonight. You see, Senator Warren stood up and was speaking with a passion about this nomination. And in the midst of her speaking her truth, in the midst of her speaking her heart, she was stopped as she read something into the Record that had been there for decades. To me that is problematic not just because it was a regular speech but because this had to do with her constitutional duty of providing advice and consent. She wasn't just quoting someone, something that she heard on the street, some hearsay. She was actually quoting Coretta Scott King, a civil rights hero, the wife of the slain Martin Luther King, who we, as Americans in our Nation--we don't have many of them--literally recognize with a national holiday. So that makes it all the more disturbing to me that Senator Warren would stand up, exercising what is one of her specifically constitutional, mandated duties and was stopped because of a rule being enforced that in my opinion, as well as Leader Schumer's, is selectively enforced. But let's go further into the fact that the contents of that letter, much of it shared, are actually substantive and have bearing on the thoughts and feelings of many people in the  I was raised by a family who made very clear to me something that I think Elie Wiesel said: The opposite of love is not hate, it is silence. It is a profound sin to witness injustice, to see something wrong, and to simply be a bystander, to not speak up.  What I respect about many of my colleagues, even those with whom I disagree--and what I respect about Senator Warren--is that they embody a tradition that I was taught by my parents: to speak truth to power, to speak truth even if your legs are shaking, even if your voice quivers. Speak truth. Do not be a bystander. Do not sit in indifference. Stand up and speak your truth. Do not let your soul be silenced.  We are here as a country because at a time of rife moral injustice, people didn't remain silent. This idea of speech in this country is so important that it is enshrined in the Constitution that we should have freedom of speech, and, yes, it is not always comfortable to hear.  I sat where the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Alaska, is sitting, and[[Page S874]]there were many times I heard things that were uncomfortable, that I disagreed with, that I thought were wrong, but this body should respect the idea of free speech.  Tonight, I am proud of Senator She stood and told her truth. To see this body act as it did tonight is disappointing to me, and it is not a violation of the ideals of comity. It is not.  I heard great conversations from people I revere. Senator Hatch spoke tonight. He is a great man. I don't agree with him all the time. I think some of his ideas--I actually think sometimes they are dangerous ideas, but I respect him. He and Teddy Kennedy--two men who argued with each other, sometimes with voices raised in a lack of comity--had a love for each other.  I was told by other senior Senators when I first arrived: Yeah, give it all you have got in debates. Argue and fight, but understand that in the end we are all people who love our country.  Nobody is questioning Jeff Sessions' love of country. Nobody here is questioning his kindness and collegiality. I experienced that. I have spent 3 years in the He is far senior to me, and there is no time that we connected on the floor or in the Senate gym in which he didn't show me kindness and respect. Let's put that aside.  He and I even stood together and passed a resolution here in this body to give the Medal of Freedom to marchers across the Edmund Pettus One of those marchers was John  Does that mean that if John Lewis believes strongly that to have Jeff Sessions ascend to the most powerful law enforcement office in the land, he should remain silent? Does that mean he should be quiet about that? In fact, John Lewis testified in the hearings in the Judiciary Committee against Jeff Why? Because that is our tradition.  So I start my remarks tonight, aggrieved by what I saw happen to Elizabeth In fact, it stunned me. I didn't even believe it when I heard that a U.Senator would be silenced by another U.Senator from reading something that had been in the record for 30 years, as if somehow we are afraid to hear that truth on that paper or in her heart. God bless her for standing up and speaking up and refusing to be silent, and then, in the tradition of the King family, taking the consequences.  I want to state that what she did respects a difference that is worth analyzing for a moment. We have colleagues here with whom we disagree. We are part of the U.There is a lot of respect back and forth. Again, the senior Senator from Utah is a giant in my eyes. The eulogy he gave at Senator Teddy Kennedy's funeral was one of my favorite U.Senate moments, even though it didn't happen on this floor. But it did show that two men could fight and disagree and could still have respect for each other; two men could raise their voices at times and have passionate arguments about what they believed in. This body was designed to bring people of diverse geographies--thank God, eventually diverse racial backgrounds, diverse gender--all together to represent our States and to have it out.  No one Senator has supreme power. This is not the Executive branch. Both sides have to want things. We have to meet a 60-vote threshold on some occasions. That is the type of power we have here.  When someone from here leaves this position and moves to the executive branch and is heading an agency, they have tremendous power. In fact, the Attorney General is one of the most powerful positions in America and actually even in some sense is independent of the The idea of the Attorney General is that when the President is wrong, the Attorney General has a role and lets the President know that, taking the appropriate action.  So while Jeff Sessions is a valued colleague as a Senator, there is a moral obligation that all of us have enshrined in the Constitution of the advice and consent power to tell our truth because here our power as individuals is made manifest by our ability to develop coalitions. But in the executive branch, especially in the Attorney General's position, that power is residing in the individual, that power is real, that power has dramatic effects on the lives of everyday So when that is happening, we cannot remain silent.  I am so proud that Senator Elizabeth Warren actually did not just read a letter of Coretta Scott King; she honored that Martin Luther King tradition. King said: ``Our lives begin to end the day we begin to be silent about things that matter.'' King also wrote: ``There comes a time when silence is betrayal.''  I can't betray my values or my ideals. This body is in many ways a testimony to the ideals of freedom of speech in America, a body that is exhibiting in many ways to this country why fervent debate is so important in the marketplace of ideas.  To silence a voice, to silence a Senator--that is unconscionable under the pretext that somehow she was impugning the character of another That is unacceptable, especially in light of so many things that have been said on the Senate floor that weren't checked, weren't called out. But at a time when a Senator is standing strong for what she believes and speaking her truth, there is what is tantamount to a censure.  I came to this body on a very auspicious day. It was I was sworn in on Halloween, 2013. It was October, and my election was just days earlier. Six days before I had been elected to the U.Senate, my father died.  I confess, on that day I was feeling a sense of pride, standing right over there with the Vice I was feeling pride, but I was also hollow in my heart. I was hurting because I knew my dad would have wanted to see me become a This guy who was born poor in a segregated community in the South, in the mountains of North Carolina, could never have imagined that one day his son would be sworn in as a U. My dad taught me lessons, as so many of our fathers did. I learned about hard work. I learned about sacrifice. Jane Baldwin said it best: Children are never good at listening to their elders, but they never fail to imitate them. I thank God to this day that I had models to emulate.  But if there is anything my father taught me, it is: Son, you didn't get where you are on your own. That is interesting for me to hear from a guy who, by every other measure, was a self-made man. To watch my dad go at his craft, to watch him work and sacrifice on snow days in New Jersey, when I was a grade school kid, the first sound I would hear would be him shoveling the driveway because he was going to be the first person at work, no matter what. Often I would come home from school or go to my games and my dad wouldn't be there because he was going to make sure to be the last one to leave the office, setting the bar as a manager.  But here was a self-made man, looking at me every step of the way, and letting me know: Son--sometimes it would be boy--you didn't get here on your own. I would walk around my house, staring in the refrigerator, and he would say: Boy, don't you dare walk around this house like you hit a triple. You were born on third base.  Well, yes, I got it after years because my father said: Son, you are where you are because of this Nation, not just the values and ideals. I mean, come on, I want to tell the truth. This is a country that was formed with a level of genius that I can't take away from, a level of ascendant thought in the span of human history that is remarkable, and my father respected that, but he knew that what makes this country real was not just what our Founders did, it is what average Americans did to make real the promise of this democracy. Even when challenges occurred in this country, they didn't think they befell themselves, they somehow fought to make this country more real.  As great as our Founders are and as great as our Constitution is, let's look at those documents and be honest with each other. Native Americans are referred to as savages in our Declaration of Women aren't referred to at all. African Americans were fractions of human beings. What was the spirit that took an imperfect document and founding ideals and made them more perfect? What was that spirit?

12282,topic-id,2329,"Mr.President, the job of the Attorney General of the United States is to enforce laws that protect the rights of each and every More than ever--more than ever--we need leaders who can bring Americans together to improve police-community relations, to ensure that all Americans have access to the ballot, and to reform our criminal justice system.  In the city in which I live, in Cleveland, we are under a consent decree today which already is improving relations between the police and the community. We saw it more than a decade ago in Cincinnati, where Mayor Cranley--then a member of the council and now the mayor--has worked with the community, as have others. We see more people of color in the police department, and we see better training for police. We see improved relations in that community, in large part because the community came together--police, community leaders, citizens--to make[[Page S905]]for better relationships and better relations inside the community. The consent decree there made a huge difference in that city. The consent decree in Cleveland is making a difference there. That is partly the job of the Attorney General--to make sure the Department of Justice stays on course to do that.  When we think of leaders whom we need to improve police-community relations, to ensure Americans have access to the ballot, and to reform our criminal justice system, Senator Sessions is simply not that leader. It is not personal. I have worked with Senator Sessions on issues like trade. I actually told him that, if he had been nominated as the Trade Representative, I would have happily voted for him. But we have strong policy differences on the issues that directly fall under the role of the Attorney  I examined his nearly 40-year record as a U.attorney, the attorney general of Alabama, and as U.Based on that record, I was the first in the Senate to say I cannot support his nomination. I told Senator Sessions on the floor of the Senate after I made that decision, before I announced it.  I have serious concerns that Senator Sessions' record on civil rights is at direct odds with the task of promoting justice and equality for all. What is more important in an Attorney General than that?  Senator Sessions has a history of racial insensitivity, bias against immigrants, disregard for the rule of law, hostility to the protection of civil rights--exactly what we don't need in the Attorney General of the United States of  He condemned the Department of Justice's investigation of law enforcement agencies accused of violating civil rights. He voted against the Violence Against Women One issue after another after another disqualifies him from being the Attorney General of the United  Senator Sessions is wrong on voting rights. I served as Secretary of State of Ohio in the 1980s. I take voting rights very seriously. I believe we should be doing everything we can to make it easier for Americans to vote. In those days, in the 1980s, during the Reagan years in Washington, in Ohio we had voter registration, voter outreach, aggressive enrollment of new people to vote, of young people, of people regardless of political affiliation, regardless of ideology, regardless of age and race and income. We encouraged people to vote. We had good cooperation from Republicans and Democrats alike in the legislature.  I even approached the McDonald's corporation and asked them to print tray liners. They put tray liners on every tray. You go to McDonald's and order food. So I asked them to print the voter registration form on tray liners. They printed a million registration-form tray liners, resulting in thousands and thousands of voter registrations--some perhaps with ketchup stains or mustard stains on them, but nonetheless voter registration forms that were accepted by local boards of elections.  Utility companies included voter registration forms in their bills. Newspapers printed them in their daily papers so people could tear them out, fill them out, and send them in.  That was what we did for aggressive voter outreach, supported by people across the political spectrum.  But Senator Sessions doesn't seem to agree with that kind of voter outreach. He has a history of supporting voter ID laws that make it harder to vote. He refused to disavow President Trump's false statement--provably false. Lots of people may believe it because President Trump said it, but it is a provably false statement that there were 3 to 5 million illegal votes in this past election--no evidence, just demagoguery, just lies. But Senator Sessions was unwilling to disavow his perhaps future boss's comments.  Do we want an Attorney General, chief law enforcement official that is going to let the President go out and make statements like that that are provably false? Call them what they are--lies from the President of the United Do we want an Attorney General who is simply going to brush those away and pay no attention?  Senator Sessions called Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, good news for the South, even though, overwhelmingly, Senators in both parties had voted to renew and reauthorize the Voting Rights He called it good news for the South to weaken protections for people of color and others in voting rights.  Since that misguided decision, States across the country have passed new voting restrictions that would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of As Senator Sessions apparently was celebrating by saying ``good news for the South,'' Texas moved within 2 hours of the decision. Alabama, taking their cue from people like Senator Sessions, acted the next day to restrict voting rights. As soon as the Court moved in a way the Court hadn't moved in five decades, State after State began to restrict voting rights because they had license to, because they had a green light, because they now had legal authority--something they had not had in 50 years.  At least 17 States have passed new voting restrictions since the Shelby County decision, although my State wasn't covered by it. My State, shamefully, is one of those that has restricted voting rights, even though from the 1980s into the 1990s, people of both parties joined me in wanting to expand voting rights and make sure that everybody--regardless of disability, age, gender, race, nationality, or income--was able to vote.  We know who is hurt most by these laws, and there is political reason for it. We know who is hurt most--it is African Americans, Latinos, young people, and seniors. It just happens to be the voters who potentially might vote against the far right, which has lobbied hard after the decision to scale back voting rights.  Senator Sessions called the Voting Rights Act intrusive. Tell that to Congressman Lewis, who was beat up walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, in Senator Sessions' State, who risked his life numbers of times, who was injured more, probably, than anybody in the civil rights movement, including in his home State of Alabama--Congressman Lewis' and Senator Sessions' home State of  Senator Sessions knows what happened to secure those voting rights for African Americans in his He was a young man at the time and saw what happened in the 1950s, and Rosa Parks and John Lewis in the 1950s and 1960s, and still he calls the Voting Rights Act intrusive.  I remember in my State, in 2004, people had to wait 6 hours in Greene County to vote, in Knox County people had to wait 9 hours to vote. The people who are penalized the most are not people of higher income, who tend to have a little more flexibility in their schedule and who can leave work during lunch, go vote, and go back to work. If they have to wait more than 30, 40, 50 minutes or an hour, they often can't do it. They have to pick up their kids where daycare is expensive, and we know that many of them give up and don't vote, which might just be the purpose of people behind the Shelby County vs. Holder decision.  In 1981, when signing an extension to the Voting Rights Act, President Reagan called the right to vote the crown jewel of American liberties. President Reagan said it is the crown jewel of American liberties. Senator Sessions called the Voting Rights Act intrusive.  A couple of extensions later, the Court pulled back with Shelby County vs. Keep this in mind. Sometimes these pass the Congress unanimously. President Reagan said it was the crown jewel of American liberties. The Attorney General-designee calls the Voting Rights Act intrusive.  We need an Attorney General who will use the full extent of his powers to protect the right to vote, not stand by as State after State attempts to suppress it. The Attorney General as a Senator has stood by while the President of the United States has simply lied about 3 to 5 million illegal voters.  The Attorney General-designee stood by and said nothing and was unwilling to criticize the President of the United I am concerned that when State after State attempts to suppress the vote and roll back voting rights, he will stand by and do nothing because he called the Voting Rights Act intrusive.  As to criminal justice reform, we need to reform our criminal justice[[Page S906]]system and stop ruining the lives of far too many young Black men over nonviolent offenses. Senator Sessions has opposed bipartisan efforts, and there have been a number of them and a number of courageous leaders in this body who have sometimes taken politically unpopular positions on criminal justice reform and done the right thing. Senator Sessions, however, has opposed bipartisan efforts in the criminal justice reform. At the outset of my speech, I mentioned Cleveland and Cincinnati, where it is a decade and a half later, and it has proven to be a success. In Cleveland, it is shaping up to be a success. He has called consent decrees that mandate reform of law enforcement agencies ``an end run around the democratic process.''  Reform of law enforcement agencies in many ways means better police training, with real dollars and real effort put into that police training. Again, he calls all of this ``an end run around the democratic process.'' Senator Sessions blocked bipartisan efforts to reduce sentences for certain nonviolent drug offenses.  There is surely a need for an independent Attorney General, and that is my third macro concern about my colleague Senator Sessions being elevated to be the Attorney General of the United States of In light of President Trump's cruel and foolish and badly executed Executive order on immigrants and refugees, we need an Attorney General who will be an independent voice beholden to the Constitution and the American people, not to the We have seen this order wreak havoc on Ohio students and families.  A Cleveland father who had waited 4 years to reunite with his 14-year-old son was forced to wait even longer when his refugee son was banned.  We are a nation that embraces refugees. My son-in-law, at the age of 10, was living in El Salvador with his family. His mother was a journalist. His mother was the target of threats to her life because of political violence in El My son-in-law's family came to the United States and was welcomed in this country. We welcome refugees who were victims, potential victims, or about to be victims of political violence or violence of any kind. That is what we are as a nation.  My son-in-law is married to our daughter. They now have a son who is not much more than 1 year old. He has been a terrific citizen of this country. He has contributed a lot. We know that when a great majority of refugees come here they build lives, they make a difference in the world, and they can live in a free, prosperous nation with opportunity.  I mentioned the Cleveland father. I mentioned my son-in-law. A doctor on her way to the Cleveland Clinic to help treat Ohioans was sent back. She now has returned to the United States, finally, after expensive legal issues, trauma, and all the things that happen when somebody is pushed around by a system like that with an arrogant White House inflicting that kind of pain on her family.  The Iraqis who risked their lives to help American troops have been told: There is no place for you here.  Think about that. The first night after the Executive order, a translator from Iraq, an Iraqi, who had helped American troops and whose own life was threatened, knew he had to leave his country because a number of people targeted people who helped the He came here. He was handcuffed for hour after hour in a New York airport.  What message does that send to people who help Americans, who help the American Armed Forces around the world?  Students are prevented from coming to our State to learn and contribute in our great Ohio universities. We saw that in Ohio We are seeing that in other places. Judges across the country, appointed by Republican and Democratic Presidents, are striking down this order because it is not constitutional. It does not represent American values. It makes us less, not more, safe.  In 2015, Senator Sessions questioned Sally Yates in her confirmation to be Deputy Attorney General, asking her this question: ``Do you think the Attorney General has the responsibility to say no to the President if he asks for something that is improper?''  Senator Sessions is asking an Obama nominee: ``Do you think the Attorney General has the responsibility to say no to the President if he asks for something that is improper?''  He went on to say: ``If the views the President wants to execute are unlawful, should the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General say no?''  That was a Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for Deputy Attorney Sally Yates in 2015.

12256,topic-id,2501,"Mr.Speaker, last Friday the House and the Senate met to fulfill our solemn constitutional responsibility to count the votes of electors for President and Vice This year the joint session was confronted with a record number of so-called faithless electors--electors who were supposed to vote for the Presidential candidates named on their States' ballot, but, instead, voted for someone else.  Different States handle their faithless electors in different ways. In my view, the joint session rightly fulfilled its constitutional responsibility by simply taking the certified results of each State without intervention. This was in line with precedent set in 1969 and with the text of the  Because I believe this decision to be correct, I did not file an objection during the counting process. However, I wish for the Record to contain my views on this matter and to express my concern that an avoidable constitutional crisis on this subject is a very real possibility in the future.  The faithless elector problem has often been seen as academic, but in 2000, Vice President Gore was three faithless electors away from the As a point of reference, there were 10 faithless electors in this election. Thus, this is not a matter that should be taken lightly.  Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution gives the States the exclusive power to appoint electors in a manner decided by their State legislatures. Clause 4 provides the sole grant of authority to Congress in the process to determine the time for choosing electors and the day they cast their vote.  The process to count electors is outlined in Clause 3 and identical language which superseded it in the 12th It provides that, ``The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted. . . .'' Under the 12th Amendment, the persons receiving a majority of the vote ``shall be'' the President and Vice  The extent of what Congress' powers are in the counting process has been the subject of over 200 years of debate. The Congressional Record from 1800 includes a lengthy speech by Senator Charles Pinckney, a Framer of the Constitution, who stated that as the Framers wished the President to be independent, ``It never was intended . . . to have given to Congress . . . the right to object to any electoral vote.''  The first successful effort to expand Congress' power in counting did not come until 1865, when Congress adopted a joint House-Senate rule on the subject. Under the rule, no electoral vote that incurred an objection could be counted unless both Houses agreed.  The joint rule was tempered by the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which still governs the counting process to this day. The law allows an objection signed by a House and a Senate However, under the Electoral Count Act, unless there is a case of double returns, no electoral vote regularly given and lawfully certified shall be rejected.  In 1969, Lloyd Bailey, a Republican elector from North Carolina, was faithless, and the Governor of North Carolina certified the State's electoral certificate with knowledge of his vote.  The House and the Senate thoroughly debated whether Bailey's vote should be counted, but ultimately voted to reject the challenge. Opponents of the challenge, in my view, properly argued that Congress lacked the power to exclude Bailey's vote under the Electoral Count Act and, more importantly, Congress had no power to exclude his vote under the To do so would be a violation of the rights of the sovereign  Some have argued that the Bailey precedent is not applicable when an elector violates his or her State's law in casting a faithless vote. I find this argument constitutionally suspect. Unless no candidate reaches a majority, Congress' role in the counting process appears to be ministerial: to count votes and announce a result.  For that reason, the issue of faithless electors is rightly resolved at the State level, before the results reach At the present time, however, a[[Page H198]]hodgepodge of State laws exist to deal with faithless electors, some of which are ill-equipped to handle the problem.  Fortunately, the Uniform Law Commission has proposed the Faithful Presidential Electors Act, which has already been enacted in four The Faithful Presidential Electors Act provides a State-administered pledge of faithfulness, with any attempt by an elector to submit a vote in violation of that pledge constituting a resignation from the office of elector. In such case, the act provides a mechanism for filling an electoral vacancy.  At the conclusion of my remarks, I will include in the Record a copy of the Faithful Presidential Electors  In short, Mr.Speaker, based upon my view of the Constitution, Congress properly handled the issue of faithless electors in this election. This election should, however, serve as a wake-up call to States that further action on their part may be necessary.

SHORT This [act] may be cited as the      Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors       SECTION 2. In this [act]:       (1) ``Cast'' means accepted by the [Secretary of State] in      accordance with Section 7(b).       (2) ``Elector'' means an individual selected as a      presidential elector under [applicable state statute] and      this [act].       (3) ``President'' means President of the United       (4) [``Unaffiliated presidential candidate'' means a      candidate for President who qualifies for the general      election ballot in this state by means other than nomination      by a political party.]       [(5)] ``Vice President'' means Vice President of the United            SECTION 3. DESIGNATION OF STATE'S For each      elector position in this state, a political party contesting      the position[, or an unaffiliated presidential candidate,]      shall submit to the [Secretary of State] the names of two      qualified individuals. One of the individuals must be      designated ``elector nominee'' and the other ``alternate      elector nominee''. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5      through 8, this state's electors are the winning elector      nominees under the laws of this state.       Legislative Note: For a state wishing to accommodate      unpledged electors, the following three sentences could be      substituted for the first two sentences of Section 3: ``Any      political party [or unaffiliated presidential candidate]      advancing candidates for elector positions in this state      shall submit to the [Secretary of State] the names of two      qualified individuals for each elector position to be      contested. One of the individuals must be designated      ``elector nominee'' and the other ``alternate elector      nominee''. Any unpledged candidate for the position of      elector who is not nominated by a political party or      unaffiliated presidential candidate shall submit to the      [Secretary of State], in addition to the individual's own      name as ``elector nominee'', the name of another qualified      individual designated as ``alternate elector nominee''.''       SECTION 4. Each elector nominee and alternate      elector nominee of a political party shall execute the      following pledge: ``If selected for the position of elector,      I agree to serve and to mark my ballots for President and      Vice President for the nominees for those offices of the      party that nominated me.'' [Each elector nominee and      alternate elector nominee of an unaffiliated presidential      candidate shall execute the following pledge: ``If selected      for the position of elector as a nominee of an unaffiliated      presidential candidate, I agree to serve and to mark my      ballots for that candidate and for that candidate's vice-     presidential running mate.''] The executed pledges must      accompany the submission of the corresponding names to the      [Secretary of State].       Legislative Note: This act does not deal with the      possibility of death of a presidential or vice-presidential      candidate before the electoral college meetings, or with any      other disabling condition or the discovery of disqualifying      information. A state may choose to deal separately with one      or another of these possibilities.       SECTION 5. CERTIFICATION OF In submitting this      state's certificate of ascertainment as required by 3 U.S.     Section 6, the [Governor] shall certify this state's electors      and state in the certificate that:       (1) the electors will serve as electors unless a vacancy      occurs in the office of elector before the end of the meeting      at which elector votes are cast, in which case a substitute      elector will fill the vacancy; and       (2) if a substitute elector is appointed to fill a vacancy,      the [Governor] will submit an amended certificate of      ascertainment stating the names on the final list of this      state's electors.       SECTION 6. PRESIDING OFFICER; ELECTOR       (a) The [Secretary of State] shall preside at the meeting      of electors described in Section 7.       (b) The position of an elector not present to vote is      vacant. The [Secretary of State] shall appoint an individual      as a substitute elector to fill a vacancy as follows:       (1) if the alternate elector is present to vote, by      appointing the alternate elector for the vacant position;       (2) if the alternate elector for the vacant position is not      present to vote, by appointing an elector chosen by lot from      among the alternate electors present to vote who were      nominated by the same political party [or unaffiliated      presidential candidate];       (3) if the number of alternate electors present to vote is      insufficient to fill any vacant position pursuant to      paragraphs (1) and (2), by appointing any immediately      available individual who is qualified to serve as an elector      and chosen through nomination by and plurality vote of the      remaining electors, including nomination and vote by a single      elector if only one remains;       (4) if there is a tie between at least two nominees for      substitute elector in a vote conducted under paragraph (3),      by appointing an elector chosen by lot from among those      nominees; or       (5) if all elector positions are vacant and cannot be      filled pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4), by appointing      a single presidential elector, with remaining vacant      positions to be filled under paragraph (3) and, if necessary,      paragraph (4).       (c) To qualify as a substitute elector under subsection      (b), an individual who has not executed the pledge required      under Section 4 shall execute the following pledge: ``I agree      to serve and to mark my ballots for President and Vice      President consistent with the pledge of the individual to      whose elector position I have succeeded.''.       Legislative Note: As with Sections 3 and 4, adjustment of      this Section is required for any state where unpledged      electors are permissible. For a state wishing to accommodate      unpledged electors, the language of subsections (b)(2),      (b)(3), and (c) could be changed to the following:       (b)(2): ``if the alternate elector for the vacant position      is not present to vote but other alternate electors who were      nominated by the same political party [or unaffiliated      presidential candidate] are present, by appointing an elector      chosen by lot from among those alternate electors of the same      political party [or of the same unaffiliated presidential      candidate] .''       (b)(3): ``if the vacant position is that of an unpledged      elector and the alternate elector for that vacant position is      not present to vote, or if there otherwise are no alternate      electors eligible for the vacant position under paragraphs      (1) and (2), by appointing any immediately available      individual who is qualified to serve as an elector and has      been chosen through nomination by and plurality vote of the      remaining electors, including nomination and vote by a single      elector if only one remains.''       (c): ``To qualify as a substitute elector for a vacant      position associated with an elector who had executed a      pledge, an individual who has not executed the pledge      required under Section 4 shall execute the following pledge:      ``I agree to serve and to mark my ballots for President and      Vice President consistent with the pledge of the individual      to whose elector position I have succeeded''.''

12272,topic-id,8964,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this morning to join my colleague from the Pacific Northwest speaking in opposition to the nomination of our colleague to the position of U.Attorney  I thank the Senator from I know he has been here for several hours. I listened to much of his remarks, and many of the issues he brought up in his statement reflect the issues that we in the Pacific Northwest are dealing with--the population of the Pacific Northwest concerns--and how many people in our part of the country have moved forward on so many important issues of equal protection for all Americans under the law. So I thank my colleague for being here. I thank him for the many things he had to say this evening on this subject.  I hearken back in my own life, as I reflect on this decision, to the time I grew up. This is something that has been instilled in me as a young person growing up in the 1960s and 1970s.  I saw the most incredible events happen in our Nation's government, and I saw a position--both the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General, someone who is now a Pacific Northwest resident--use that office, the power of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, to say they disagreed with the President of the United Not only did they disagree with the President of the United States, they would rather resign from office than carry out the acts he was asking them to carry out.  As a young person, that Saturday night massacre was an incredible indelible image of how people should act responsibly in carrying out their duties.  So when I think about this position of Attorney General, I think of that very issue; that I want an Attorney General who will stand up for the citizens of the United States, no matter what, even if he has to go against the President of the United That, to me, is the ultimate in serving the people of this country.  In many ways, in the last several weeks, I feel like we have been relitigating the 1960s and 1970s. When we[[Page S891]]talk about the civil liberties of American citizens, whether they are the LGBT community; or whether we are talking about government maybe using backdoor devices to spy on American citizens; or whether we are talking about immigrant rights, we are talking about the same things people fought for in the 1960s and 1970s. So it is no surprise that my colleague--also from Massachusetts--reflected on this in some of the comments she made last night that raised such a ruckus and concern on the floor. I certainly supported her and supported her in her rights to make those comments, but these larger issues about how one wields power at the enormous office of responsibility of Attorney General is what is at question in the I could go on this morning about many other issues I am concerned about in relation to the nexus of the Attorney General to the other positions that we are also considering, but this morning I am going to keep my remarks specifically to the Attorney  In this new information era--and I have been out here on other nights, in fact with my colleague from Kentucky Mr.Paul, to discuss these very important issues of encryption and making sure the U.government does not unduly spy on U.citizens.  I am concerned that the President's nominee has supported President Bush's warrantless wiretapping and domestic surveillance programs. He also has supported law enforcement's backdoor key to encryption.  I will say, there are many things we need to do to fight this war on terrorism and to be strong in working together with law enforcement all across the United States and on an international basis. I will be the first to say there are great things we can do as it relates to biometrics and using biometrics effectively, but when it comes down to it, it is all about us working with the international community and getting cooperation from them to work that way, as opposed to running over the civil liberties of U.citizens. So I do have concerns that the President's nominee on this issue may not stand up to the President of the United States in making sure civil liberties of Americans are protected.  I am also concerned this nominee will not fully protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender The reason I say that is because of his record, and the doubts it raises because of his opposition to various pieces of legislation which have moved through these Halls--opposition to gay rights, same-sex marriage, hate crime laws, voting rights for historically disfranchised communities, and workplace protection for women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. All of these are things I wish we would have in an Attorney General who had been a greater advocate for the transition that America has made in protecting civil liberties in these issues.  These are very big issues in my They are very big issues that have been long discussed--probably discussed before they reached this body--and decided decisively in favor of the civil liberties of these So I find it troubling that in his position, the nominee used his power to target the LGBT student housing and education conference at the University of Alabama, and that he consistently voted against LGBT Americans' right to live where they choose, and voted for the constitutional amendment my colleague mentioned, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crime Prevention Act--not being supportive on those issues.  These are important issues that mark our country's ability to stand up for civil liberties. It is important in this era and time, because of the hate crimes and the horrific things that have happened to these individuals, that we have someone who not only recognizes those, but embodies the fact that these individuals are facing discrimination and must continually--continually--have someone to fight for their civil liberties.  The nominee sponsored legislation to roll back, as I said, LGBT rights in housing, employment, and health care, and there are an estimated 10 million LGBT Americans who are protected by our Nation's hate crime and anti-discrimination laws. What we want is leadership. We want leadership to continue on these issues. We want leadership that when we see problems, they are going to be addressed, even if it means fighting what the President of the United States has to say.  My colleague also had opposed the reinstatement of the Voting Rights Act and strongly supported voter ID laws that put barriers up for the elderly, indigent communities, and communities of color to get access to their ballots. I can tell you as a Washingtonian that nothing is more important to us than this issue of voting rights, and I would match our system with any other State in the We vote by mail. We have seen as high as 84-percent voter turnout in a Presidential year, and incredibly high turnout even in a midterm election.  We know that giving our citizens the right to vote, and making progress on everyone having the right to vote, including the use of provisional ballots, making sure the law is clear in embracing and making sure people have the opportunity to vote, and have their votes counted, are going to continue to be issues in the United States of We want people to have total confidence in our voting system, and we want them to have confidence that every citizen has a right to cast a vote, and will not be turned away at the ballot box because of an artificial barrier.  Believe me, there are lots of ways to catch fraud and corruption in the voting system in the State of Washington because it is based on your signature. Have we had people make mistakes in the system? They have been caught or corrected.  The notion that our system needs all of these other artificial barriers is not true. It is a system that has worked well for us and, as I said, has empowered more people to participate in our electoral system.  I want someone who is going to help us move forward in this country. The notion that we are putting up lines of obstacles for voting in this country should not be the way we are going. We need to go in the other direction.  I am concerned that the next Attorney General will fail to protect the civil liberties of all Americans, irrespective of their race, and protect opportunities to participate in our democracy and to make sure we are continuing to move forward. He has called the work of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union ``un-American.'' Let us remember that in our time, we need people who are going to recognize the rights of individuals and stand up for them. If in the past his judgment and temperament on these issues has expressed a lack of concern for these individuals, my question for all of us is, what kind of leadership will that drive for the next Attorney General?  He has called the decision in Roe v. Wade ``a colossal mistake'' and has cast 86 anti-choice votes, including a vote against protecting abortion providers and their patients from anti-choice violence. Washington State has one of the strongest statutes in the country for protecting a woman's right to choose. It was something we did before the national law. It is something many people in my State feel strongly about, and, yes, in the past, we have experienced violence at clinics.  In fact, in September 2015, there was a devastating bombing of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Pullman, WA--a tragedy that was unbelievable. The fact that those clinicians showed up in the parking lot the next day and continued to deliver services, and that law enforcement was there to help them and respect them is what I expect out of our system and the U.Attorney General--that someone will be there to help enforce the law and deter these kinds of crimes and make sure that we are moving forward as a country.  I said earlier that I feel as though we are relitigating the sixties and seventies. I wish that those issues had all gone away, but I feel as if they are still with us. These examples of disrespect toward the civil liberties of individuals, and using violence as a way to demonstrate that disrespect, require a swift hand of justice to oppose them.  My colleague voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that gender-based pay disparity claims could be heard in court. This is also something of great concern to many Americans, not just women. It is a concern to men as well, because men want[[Page S892]]their wives to make the salary they deserve, to make certain their family has the income it deserves.  These are battles that we are going to continue to fight in the United States of America until we have fair pay. I do view it as a civil rights issue. As I said, Lilly Ledbetter amended the Civil Rights  He also voted against the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which ensures that law enforcement has the every resource necessary to investigate cases of rape, and provides colleges with the tools to educate students about dating violence, sexual assault, and to maintain the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which fields 22,000 calls a month from Americans facing threats of domestic violence.  That issue in and of itself, along with the amount of domestic violence that women face in the United States of America, is something that needs constant vigilance and constant attendance in order to fight against. I don't know all the reasons he did not support that legislation, but I know one aspect. He opposed language in the Violence Against Women Act allowing tribes to prosecute nontribal members who commit domestic violence against tribal members on reservation land. That is right. People were coming onto Indian reservations across our country. In Washington State, we have 29 recognized tribes. On those sites, people were committing crimes of domestic violence but, because of a loophole, weren't being prosecuted. There were unbelievable amounts of violence.  The last administration came up with a way to work together to make sure that those crimes were prosecuted. It is as if the Federal system couldn't affect all the activity that was happening, but it could work in concert with local law enforcement officials to come up with a way to make sure that women, who were being abused just because they were Native American on a tribal reservation, would get their fair justice.  I do have concerns about these issues as they relate to tribal sovereignty, to the issues of domestic violence and, particularly, domestic violence that is happening in Indian  I also want to bring up an issue I think my colleague from Oregon brought up, which is something I don't know that all of our colleagues agree on, but I am here to advocate for my State; that is, the nominee in his testimony said that he would leave to the States the question of legalizing and regulating marijuana in this administration.  In the past, he has refused to respect the rights of States that have democratically chosen to legalize marijuana for medical or recreational use. This is an important subject for us in the Pacific Northwest because we had a previous Attorney General who, after we had passed medical marijuana laws, tried to shut down our medical clinics. This was years before we passed legislation allowing for the legalization of marijuana by the broader public, not just medical marijuana.  We have seen an Attorney General who has aggressively pursued this medical use, and now we have concerns, as our State and several other States have legalized marijuana, about how this Attorney General is going to treat those actions.  We hope that this past record is not a reflection of the future and how he plans to treat individuals, but I know my colleague from Hawaii was here earlier and mentioned several cases of individuals in his State who needed that medical attention, who needed that product, who were given great comfort in their medical treatments by having access to that.  Is that now all in question? Is that something that Americans who have resided in States that have taken this action now have something to fear from the next Attorney General?  I know that there were many discussions in the confirmation hearing, and that there are concerns today relating to the issue of a ban on Muslims entering the United I will not go into great detail here, but will say that it is clear that the State of Washington has an opinion about this and that our State Attorney General and our Governor are trying to represent that viewpoint in the judicial process.  It is important to me that we get these issues right because I want to protect the civil liberties of individuals, and I see a path forward for us to be tough on these cases; that is, the true cases of terrorist activity. I say that because Washington had a case in 1999 of an individual who entered the United States at Port Angeles, He had come from Algiers, and then when he got to France, he cooked up a new identity. When he left France and went to Canada, he cooked up another identity, and then he arrived at the U.border from Canada on a boat with explosives and a plan to either blow up the Space Needle or travel to LAX and blow up the LAX  There was very good work by customs and border agents who found something unusual about this individual. It didn't add up. His passport looked as though it was valid, but something that was said gave the border agent reason to conduct a more thorough check.  In fact, they did. They opened the trunk of his car, and as they did, he ran, and with good reason because they saw a car full of explosive materials in the trunk. That so-called Millennial Bomber was caught. Since then, I have been an advocate for using biometrics as a standard for us pushing visa waiver countries for letting people into their country, as Mr.Ressam did travel, as I said, from Algiers to France, cooking up a new identity, and then France to Canada, and Canada to the United States, each time cooking up an identity.  But if we had cooperation with these countries on biometric standards; if we had implemented those biometric standards, and pushed those countries that give access to our country through the Visa Waiver Program, we would be a lot further down the road in finding those individuals who mean to do us harm.  We need cooperation by these other countries and the best techniques and standards to help us. That is far different than denying access to individuals, for example, from the Somali community that is a very big refugee community in our As I said, I will leave it to our Washington attorney general and our Governor to continue to pursue that effort.  I have heard from many Washingtonians who are concerned about this nomination. I heard from a young woman from Yakima, WA, who said she was flabbergasted by this nomination, that ``if he was deemed inadequate during the days that Strom Thurmond was in office, why now is he adequate?''  I heard from a constituent in central Washington who said: ``I am a transgender and gay, and much of the time I worry about my rights as a U.citizen, whether they'll be revoked despite the fact that my family has fought in every war in the U.since the Civil I am worried that legislation would be implemented that would dehumanize me and other LGBT community individuals, and that doesn't align with the nominee's religious beliefs.''  So these are concerns my constituents have, and I have to agree with them, that our nominee's record leaves question about his ability to fervently advocate on behalf of these individuals, given his record and history in the past. And I know that my colleague, the ranking member from the Judiciary Committee, has been out here on the floor, going in detail about the questioning that happened during the committee process on all sorts of issues, as it relates to women's rights and reproductive choice, and how we are going to continue to move forward to make sure these individuals are protected.  So, to me, my constituents are loud and clear. They want these civil liberties protected. They want an Attorney General who is going to make sure that those civil liberties are fought for and respected every day and are going to get equal protection under the law.  Here are some additional excerpts from the letters of our concerned constituents.  KS from Yakima, WA, a concerned constituent, writes: ``I am simply flabbergasted that Jeff Sessions was chosen to be our Attorney If he was deemed inadequate in the days when Strom Thurmond was in office, then he's certainly inadequate in 21st century As you are politicians, I shouldn't have to remind you of this, but I'm going to anyway. One, America was built by immigrants from[[Page S893]]all over the world, on top of an already diverse nation of the First Two, there are over 300 languages spoken in the U.S., nearly half of which are indigenous. Three, people have had to fight tooth and nail against discrimination based on their race and ethnicity, and the fact that so many are still doing to that today is extremely worrisome. Four, it's been our legally protected right since 1967 to marry and have a family with someone of a different race. Five, it's only been our legally protected right to marry and have a family with someone of the same gender since 2015. Six, my generation, the Millennials, is the most diverse of any in American history. Since 2000, 40 percent of all children have been born to multiracial families. And those children will be eligible to vote before you know it. The ones born in 2000 will likely have a lot to say come the midterm election. This America cannot, should not, MUST NOT have an attorney general who thought the Klan was too liberal. He has no place at a school crosswalk, let alone leading the most powerful nation in the free world. PLEASE do not let this happen!''  SL from Wenatchee, WA, writes: ``He has repeatedly shown within his career that he clearly sees the LGBTQ+ community as something that is acceptable to discriminate against. Most notably is his support of the Defense of Marriage This worries me very deeply since I am Transgender and gay. Much of the time I worry that my rights as a US citizen will be revoked, despite the fact that my family has fought in every war in the US since the Civil I am worried that he would allow legislation to be law that would dehumanize me and other LGBTQ+ individuals because it doesn't align with his apparent religious beliefs. He also seems to not hold much issue with civil rights as long as they don't go `too far.' Additionally, his continual stance against immigrants could have a distinct impact on my city and community. We have a large Hispanic and Mexican population, many of them around the neighborhoods where I live. The many years I've lived here I've found our multicultural community to be hard working and not the `evil' that Trump is adamant to make them out to be. I do not feel reassured if he becomes the Attorney General that he would stand up to Trump and fairly support these marginalized individuals in the Department of Justice.''  JH from Seattle, WA, writes: ``I trust that you will protect and stand for the ideals of our country and vote no to the appointment of Jeff Sessions as Attorney The job of the Justice Department is to protect all people, and to enforce the laws of the land to do so. Sessions has not in word or deed demonstrated he is capable of doing so. Even while awaiting confirmation, he is supporting discrimination against LGBTQ people by his support of the I expect any person confirmed in our government to clearly support all people--black, brown, white, male, female, transgender, gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, Jew, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Native, atheists, and people of all ethnicity. The Attorney General is responsible for upholding The Constitution--including Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. This means upholding the Constitution, including Press's right to cover Mr.Trump and report as they see fit--not censored news. This also means supporting The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. This means insisting that the Justice Department hold themselves and local police forces accountable for detaining and searching people--and do promulgate brutality from behind the badge. Instead of Jeff Sessions, please garner support for and vote for a legal mind who has a demonstrated record of upholding all people's rights. There are many fine minds and hearts in our country who are up to the task. It is your responsibility as a Senator of our fine Democracy to vote only for one of them.''  Gary from Spokane, WA: ``Jeff Sessions does not believe that our laws should protect everyone. He believes certain groups should have less rights and/or less protection under the law. He will allow discrimination, based on his record. There is enough volatility in this time of ours to understand the importance of a fair minded, tempered and balanced person to head the department of justice. There is no denying we are entering a tumultuous time. There is enough concern over Jeff Sessions to give pause, consider the times we are in, and come up with a better choice. Concerns over our country turning to totalitarianism are real. The president elect is extremely polarizing and may very well be breaking the US Constitution as soon as he's sworn in, due to conflicts of interest. The attorney general certainly needs to understand these concerns and be able to enforce the laws of the American people. There are many other talented legal professionals with a wide variety of skill sets related to law enforcement. This is the time to slow down a bit; delay . . . at least this appointment. There is an appointment process for a reason. Make Mr.Trump come up with a better choice. No matter your party, there is no win in becoming a rubber stamp for Mr.I vote nay for Jeff Session as Attorney Consider the importance of this time, consider the future of our country, consider the rights guaranteed in the bill of rights. The choice then is easy, nay for Sessions, yay for thoughtful, accountable and tempered governance.''  Betsy from Waldron, WA, writes: ``Please oppose the appointment of Jeff Sessions as Attorney He is opposed to basic civil rights for all people and he cannot be put in charge of protecting those same rights. Please do not compromise with Trump or try to compromise as if he were a normal president. Please oppose, blockade, filibuster, and refuse to go along with Trump's plans to tear our country apart. I am relying on you to be our first wall of defense against this terrifying man.''  RaGena from Spokane, WA, writes: ``As a constituent I urge you to oppose the confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of the United States His voting record as senator and the content of his speeches to the Senate do not inspire confidence in his ability to discharge the responsibilities of the Attorney General's office in keeping with role of the Department of Justice in contemporary American society. His responses to the Judiciary Committee raised further, serious concerns. All this, coupled with the reasons for his failure to be confirmed as a federal judge decades ago, suggest that he is not the person for this job.''  DH from Tacoma, WA, writes: ``I am writing to express my strong opposition to the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney Everything I know about this man makes him uniquely unqualified for the post. He has not supported equal rights of minorities and has supported vote suppression as a means to reduce the effect of minority votes. In the attorney general seat, Sessions will be able to make decisions that will negatively affect the daily lives of some of our most vulnerable citizens. Please reinforce my belief in you as a leader and vote no on Jeff Sessions for attorney general.''  JG from Seattle, WA, writes: ``You must vote against confirming Jeff Sessions as Attorney His record makes clear that he will not support voting rights for all Americans and will not act to protect the rights of minorities or work to improve the criminal justice system. In fact, his record makes clear he will move to suppress voting rights and will promote DOJ actions that will hurt minorities in particular. He is not fit to serve as this country's Attorney General.''  AM from Seattle, WA, writes: ``I am a criminal defense attorney in I write to ask you to vote against confirming Jeff Sessions as United States Attorney Under the Obama administration, many inroads have been made into remedying the harms of mandatory minimum drug sentencing and other forms of drug sentencing reform. Additionally, states like Washington have been allowed to sell marijuana, legal under state law, without[[Page S894]]fear of federal prosecution. Finally, the Obama administration made good use of the civil rights division to assist in reforming police departments engaged in improper policing practices, such as I have no confidence that Jeff Sessions will continue to support any of these policies. Please do not vote to confirm him.''  LB from Seattle, WA, writes: ``Please block Jeff Sessions from becoming Attorney The idea of having a racist attorney general is appalling. We need to improve race relations in this country and in our law enforcement officers, especially. I am 41 and feel like the race relations in this country had been improving steadily throughout my life, at least on the west coast. It's very scary to me that this new administration has to brought to light all the issues that still remain but to be a great country we cannot be a divided one and with half our population being minorities this appointment seems like a huge huge step in the wrong direction.''  LR from Seattle, WA, writes: ``I am writing to ask you to do everything you can to stop the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney His record shows his hostility toward civil rights, the ACLU, the NAACP, the LGBT community and more. I am especially concerned about his ability to send us backwards on gay marriage and other civil rights laws. His appointment to head the Justice Department would be a disaster for civil rights law in this country. Please help stop this travesty.''  MY from Edmonds, WA, writes: ``I am writing to urge you to continue due diligence on the appointment of Jeff Sessions as attorney general. I do not believe the political commercial I just saw trying to paint him in a wonderful light and asking people to contact senators to urge confirmation. I continue to have concerns about what he will do to lessen voter rights and other issues under his authority. The advertisement did not change my opinion and I feel it's just full of alternative facts. Please continue to ask tough questions on all of these appointments.''  RR from Bellingham, WA, writes: ``Please do not consider Jeff Sessions for Attorney His views, clearly displayed over the course of his career, are the antithesis of what our country stands for around the world. The United States has been a bastion of freedom, truth and inclusiveness. Sadly, those qualities are rapidly disappearing, faster than o thought possible, under the Trump administration. ALL of our citizens are entitled to equality under the law. All of our citizens are entitled to live freely regardless of their race, religion, lack of religion, gender or sexuality. Jeff Sessions is dangerous. He will dismantle civil rights laws, allow racial profiling, support laws that prevent access to voting and encourage the abuse of the LGBT community. Please vote no.''  I also know there are letters from many organizations that also have opposed this nomination, and my colleague has talked about many of those, but the NAACP, civil and human rights organizations, the HRC, and the American Federation of State and County Municipal Employees have said they question the objectivity and sense of justice needed on these important issues.  I mentioned the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and other issues of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, things that people are concerned that they get the fair attention and enforcement of law. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      National Association for the                                Advancement of Colored People,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.     Re The NAACP Strongly Urges the U.Senate To Vote No on          Jeff Sessions Nomination as Attorney     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's oldest,      largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based civil      rights organization, I strongly urge you to vote against      Jefferson ``Jeff'' Beauregard Sessions III for Attorney      Throughout this contentious debate, and through his      past actions, his recorded words, and his voting record as a      United States Senator, Sessions has demonstrated a clear      disregard, disrespect, and disdain for the rights and needs      of all American people. Senator Sessions possesses neither      the political nor the moral temperament to serve as Attorney            The NAACP staunchly opposes the confirmation of Senator      Jeff Sessions based on several factors, including the fact      that he does not agree with us on a majority of issues as is      reflected in our federal legislative report card. Since 1914,      our report card has been reflective of our bread-and-butter      civil rights issues, and the fact that Senator Sessions has      averaged, since coming into Congress, just over 10%,      demonstrates his clear disregard for issues that are      important to us and to those we represent and serve. It would      be a disservice to these people who support our priorities      for us to not speak out against this nomination. Supporters      of the NAACP would argue, in fact, that the Department of      Justice is a crucial enforcer of civil rights laws and      advisor to the President and Congress on what can and should      be done if those laws are threatened. Given his disregard for      issues which protect the rights, and in some cases the lives,      of our constituents, there is no way that the NAACP can or      should be expected to sit by and support Senator Sessions'      nomination to head the U.Department of       The disdain Senator Sessions has shown for civil rights      organizations, including the NAACP, is as palatable as it is      disturbing. During his confirmation hearing in 1986 for a      federal judgeship in Alabama, Senator Sessions replied to one      question by saying, ``I'm often loose with my tongue. I may      have said something about the NAACP being un-American or      Communist, but I meant no harm by it.'' Yet he denied saying      anything disparaging about the NAACP in his recent hearing      before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 9, 2017.       Lastly, in a floor statement made earlier today, Senator      Lindsey Graham suggested that the opposition of the national      NAACP is out of step with the sentiments of      Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the      President of the Alabama State Conference of NAACP Branches      has been a leader in opposing this nomination. He was up here      on January 9, 2017, to hear Senator Sessions' testimony, a      trip he took with busloads of NAACP Members who also opposed      the confirmation. This was a day after he was arrested for      sitting in on Senator Sessions' office in Mobile as a means      of protest in which he urged Senator Sessions to withdraw his      nomination from consideration by the       In summation, I would like to reiterate that it is the      experiences of the NAACP that lead us to oppose Senator      Sessions' nomination. We further call on President Trump to      nominate an individual who have a demonstrated commitment to      the constitutional promises of civil rights, voting rights      and civil liberties protection and enforcement for all, and      an articulated respect and promise to promote the civil and      human rights of all people, regardless of their race,      ethnicity, gender, age, religion, place of national origin,      sexual preference or station in life.

An Open Letter to the United States Senate   Civil and Human Rights Organizations Oppose Confirmation of Jeff                                 Sessions       Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Reid,      Chairman Grassley, and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf of The      Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition      of more than 200 national organizations committed to promote      and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the      United States, and the 144 undersigned organizations, we are      writing to express our strong opposition to the confirmation      of Senator Jefferson Sessions (R-AL) to be the 84th      Attorney General of the United       Senator Sessions has a 30-year record of racial      insensitivity, bias against immigrants, disregard for the      rule of law, and hostility to the protection of civil rights      that makes him unfit to serve as the Attorney General of the      United In our democracy, the Attorney General is      charged with enforcing our nation's laws without prejudice      and with an eye toward justice. And, just as important, the      Attorney General has to be seen by the public--every member      of the public, from every community--as a fair arbiter of      justice. Unfortunately, there is little in Senator Sessions'      record that demonstrates that he would meet such a standard.       In 1986, when then-U.Attorney Sessions was nominated by      former President Ronald Reagan to serve as a judge on the      U.District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, the      Republican-controlled Senate upheld its constitutional duty,      undertaking a careful and comprehensive review of his record      at that time. The Judiciary Committee was presented with      compelling evidence that then-U.Attorney Sessions had a      deeply troubling record as an opponent of civil rights      enforcement, a champion of voter suppression tactics      targeting African[[Page S895]]     Americans, and a history of making racially-insensitive      statements. This record included warning an African-American      colleague to be careful about what he said ``to white      folks,'' and speaking favorably about the Ku Klux Klan, as      well as his prosecution of three African-American voting      rights activists on dozens of charges that were promptly      rejected by a jury.       As you know, the Attorney General is our nation's highest      law enforcement official, with a particular responsibility to      protect the civil and human rights of all The      Leadership Conference opposes Senator Sessions' nomination to      become Attorney General, in part, because of the previous      record we have cited. However, it would be a grave mistake to      assume that our opposition is based only on incidents prior      to his judicial nomination.       Indeed, the following are examples of his actions as a      Senator over the past 20 years that raise very disturbing      questions about his fitness to serve as Attorney General:       Voting Rights: In addition to his failed 1985 prosecution      of three voting rights activists who were working to increase      African-American registration and turnout, Senator Sessions      has voiced strong support for restrictive voter ID laws that      have had the effect of disenfranchising many otherwise      eligible voters, called the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive''      as it seeks to protect eligible minority voters, and praised      the Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder (2013)      that gutted a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This      is hardly the record of someone to be entrusted with the      protection of voting rights for all       Association with White Nationalist and Hate Groups      regarding Immigration Policy: Senator Sessions has been a      fierce opponent of comprehensive immigration reform,      referring to a bipartisan 2007 bill as ``terrorist      assistance.'' He has closely associated himself with      NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform,      and the Center for Immigration Studies, all three of which      were founded by John Tanton, who held white nationalist      beliefs and called for the preservation of a ``European-     American majority.'' Senator Sessions has also received      awards from the David Horowitz Freedom Center and Frank      Gaffney's Center for Security Policy, two organizations      designated as anti-Muslim hate groups by the Southern Poverty      Law       Hate Crimes and LGBT Rights: Senator Sessions opposed the      Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crimes Prevention      Act, even though a unanimous Supreme Court had long ago      upheld a similar state law in Wisconsin v. Mitchell (1993).      This is particularly disturbing at a time when there have      reportedly been more than 700 hate incidents committed in the      weeks since the election. The next Attorney General must      recognize that hate crimes exist, and vigorously investigate      them.       In addition, on LGBT rights, Senator Sessions supported a      constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He also      opposed the repeal of ``Don't Ask Don't Tell.''       Women's Rights: Senator Sessions has consistently opposed      legislation to advance women's rights, notably opposing      multiple efforts to address the pay gap, to protect women's      access to reproductive health services, which      disproportionately affect low-income women and women of      color, and to address the scourge of violence against all      women. Specifically, Senator Sessions opposed the Lilly      Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, enabling women to file      ongoing pay discrimination claims, and has voted multiple      times against consideration of the Paycheck Fairness      Senator Sessions also opposed Title X funding legislation,      which supports contraception, breast cancer screening and      other health services for low-income women. In addition,      Senator Sessions repeatedly voted to defund Planned      Parenthood, and in 2014, he voted against 2578 to fix the      Hobby Lobby decision by prohibiting employers from denying      coverage of any health care service, such as contraception,      required under federal law. Senator Sessions also opposed the      reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013,      and when then-candidate Donald Trump was revealed in a 2005      video to have made comments bragging about physically forcing      himself on women, Senator Sessions declined to condemn the      remarks, even questioning whether the comments described      sexual assault.       Criminal Justice Reform: Though Senator Sessions was a      longtime supporter of eliminating sentencing disparities      between crack and powder cocaine offenses, he has since been      an ardent supporter of maintaining draconian mandatory      minimum sentences. Recently, Senator Sessions helped to block      broad-based, bipartisan efforts to reduce sentences for      certain nonviolent drug offenses. He also opposed the      President's initiative to address disparities and restore      fairness to the justice system through the use of his      constitutionally granted executive clemency power. He      criticized the Department of Justice's Smart on Crime      Initiative, which has focused on prosecuting fewer but ``more      serious'' drug cases and over the last three years, has      contributed to a 20 percent reduction in overcrowding in the      federal Bureau of Finally, Senator Sessions      condemned the Department of Justice's use of its powers to      investigate law enforcement agencies accused of misconduct      and a ``pattern or practice'' of violating civil rights,      calling consent decrees that mandate reform following these      investigations ``an end run around the democratic process.''       Failing to Protect our Communities from Pollution and      Climate Change: Climate change and environmental degradation      disproportionately affect low-income families and communities      of color. Senator Sessions has a long record of voting      against protections for our clean air, water, and climate.      Among his many anti-environmental votes, in 2015 he voted for      the resolution to kill the clean power plan and for the      Barrasso bill to deny protections for streams that provide      drinking water for 113 million In 2012, he      supported a resolution that would roll back protections from      toxic mercury. America needs and deserves an Attorney General      who will take into account the health and safety of all      communities. Senator Sessions is not qualified in this regard      and cannot be counted on to protect our air, water, and      climate.       Rights of People with Disabilities: Senator Sessions      opposed efforts to implement Alabama's obligation to provide      community-based services to individuals with disabilities who      were needlessly institutionalized. In addition, he called the      Individuals with Disabilities Education Act's requirements to      include children with disabilities in mainstream education      ``the single most irritating problem for teachers throughout      America today'' and ``a big factor in accelerating the      decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all over      America.'' This opposition to integration and inclusion is      extremely concerning given the active role that the Justice      Department plays in enforcing the Americans with Disabilities      Act to enable people with disabilities to live independent      lives, be full participants in their communities, and to be      educated in neighborhood schools and regular classrooms.      Senator Sessions also opposed ratification of the Convention      on the Rights of Persons with       These aspects of Senator Sessions' record are among those      that led The Leadership Conference to believe that he should      not be confirmed as our next Attorney At the very      least, these issues must be fully aired and deliberated      before each Senator makes a final decision with respect to      his nomination--otherwise, the Senate's constitutional duty      to provide ``advice and consent'' would be reduced to a mere      farce.       Given Senator Sessions' record and public statements, the      burden should be on him to prove to the Judiciary Committee,      the Senate, and the American people--especially to      communities of color and immigrant communities--that he can      be trusted with the tremendous power of the U.Justice      Department to enforce our nation's civil rights and      immigration laws with integrity, fairness, and a sense of      justice.       The burden on Senator Sessions is not to prove that he is      not a ``racist.'' For the record, The Leadership Conference      has never made such an allegation, as we do not claim to know      what has been in his heart when he has taken the actions and      made the statements we have described above. Nevertheless, we      believe those actions and statements are themselves      disqualifying.       This is notwithstanding our recognition that Senator      Sessions' record does include some positive actions. For      example, the Southern Poverty Law Center, while expressing      opposition to his confirmation, acknowledged that he was      helpful in the Center's successful effort to sue and bankrupt      the Ku Klux Klan following its role in the 1981 lynching      death of Michael The Leadership Conference also      worked with Senator Sessions in an effort that culminated in      the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced      racial disparities in federal cocaine sentencing provisions.      While these actions are noteworthy, they do not change our      conclusion that Senator Sessions' overall record is too      troubling for him to be confirmed as Attorney       The collegiality that ordinarily governs Senate decorum is      no substitute for, and must not supersede, the Senate's      profoundly important duty to vigorously and fairly review      each nominee who comes before it. We believe that based on      this review, there can be only one conclusion: Senator      Sessions is the wrong person to serve as the U.Attorney            Thank you for your consideration of our views.

U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the      American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees      (AFSCME), I am writing to express our strong opposition to      the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of      the United Sessions has a lengthy record of      public service, but his record does not demonstrate that he      possesses the objectivity and sense of justice needed to      serve as the nation's chief law enforcement officer.       Sessions has a troubling pattern of antipathy toward      legal protections on which working families depend. He      opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act enabling women to      challenge pay discrimination. He denounced the Individuals      with Disabilities Education Act provisions that ensure that      children with disabilities are included in mainstream      education. He also opposed the[[Page S896]]     reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and the      Shepard-Byrd Hate Crimes       Sessions has expressed strong support for voter ID      laws which restrict the rights of many, otherwise, eligible      voters. He has called the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive'' as      it seeks to protect minority voters and praised the U.     Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder which gutted      a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.       Recently, Sessions helped to block bipartisan efforts      to reduce sentences for certain nonviolent drug offenses. He      has also criticized the Department of Justice's use of      consent decrees to address misconduct and violations of civil      rights by law enforcement agencies.       Testimony provided by Sessions during his hearing has      not alleviated our grave concerns about his suitability to      lead the Department of We urge you to reject his      nomination.           Sincerely,                                                       Scott Frey,     Director of Federal Government                                  ____                                       National Nurses United,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.     Maria Cantwell,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senator Cantwell: We write on behalf of the more than      150,000 registered nurse members of National Nurses United to      urge you to vote against the confirmation of Senator Jeff      Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Attorney      Much has been said by many others against      confirmation of this nominee, so we will be brief       Our members work as bedside healthcare professionals in      almost every state in the nation. We work in every hospital      setting, from small rural facilities to large urban public      health systems, in prominent research hospitals affiliated      with prestigious public and private universities, as well as      Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. We care for Americans      on every point of the demographic spectrum, at their most      vulnerable. We provide the best care we possibly can, without      regard to race, gender, national origin, religion, socio      economic circumstances, or other identifying characteristic.      That is what caring professionals do. Unfortunately, that is      not what Jeff Sessions has done in his role as a public      servant. And to vote in favor of confirming him as the chief      law enforcement officer of the United States would abdicate      your responsibility to provide the oversight necessary to      ensure that basic legal rights are enforced evenhandedly and      for the protection of all people.       As Senate colleagues, you no doubt know Senator Sessions'      record as a lawmaker, as well as his record as the U.     Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as the      Alabama Attorney It was, of course, his record in      the U.Attorney's office and his many publically verified      racially insensitive comments that resulted in a majority of      the Senate Judiciary Committee voting against confirmation      for his nomination to be a U.District Court judge in 1986.      This `no' vote happened while the Judiciary Committee was      majority Even Senator Howell Heflin, a fellow      Alabamian, voted against him, citing ``reasonable doubts''      over whether he could be ``fair and impartial.''       Senator Sessions has oft asserted that his comments over      the years were taken out of context, or intended as humor.      But his record tells the truth. Early in his career he      charged civil right leaders (``the Marion Three'') with      voting fraud related to their efforts to assist African      American voters. The fact that the defendants in that case      were acquitted didn't deter Mr.Later, as Attorney      General of Alabama, he initiated another voter fraud      investigation involving absentee ballots cast by black voters      that, again, resulted in findings of no wrong doing. During      that same timeframe, he was criticized for declining to      investigate church burnings, and he ``joked'' that he thought      Ku Klux Klan members were ``OK, until [he] learned that they      smoked marijuana.''       Against that background, Senator Sessions aggressively      interrogated Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court's first      nominee of Latino heritage. Further betraying a deep belief      in natural division between racial groups, he grilled Justice      Sotomayor about whether she could be fair to white Americans,      despite her 17-year record as a jurist and having received      the American Bar Association's highest rating. And he      expressed grave concerns that she would engage in judicial      ``empathy'' on the high court, favoring persons of certain      races or ethnicities over others. He then voted against her      confirmation.       Senator Sessions' prejudices are not only against people of      color. As an organization representing a predominately female      profession we are compelled to express our outrage that      Senator Sessions defended Donald Trump's statements about      grabbing women by the genitals, by saying that such conduct      would not constitute sexual assault. The fact that he took a      different position during his Committee hearing is of no      comfort. It only shows that he will say whatever he believes      will help land him in the seat of power to determine whether,      and against whom, to enforce our laws. His comments last fall      dismissing President-elect Trump's despicable treatment of      women is consistent with his vote in 2013 against the      Violence Against Women As nurses, we see close up the      devastating effects of domestic violence against our      patients, and we are disturbed by Senator Sessions' alleged      concern that the protection of that statute should not extend      to victims of violence on tribal lands.       Moreover, confirming Senator Sessions to the job of the top      prosecutor would exacerbate our national crisis over race      issues in policing and our criminal justice system. He      personally blocked the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act,      a bipartisan effort spearheaded by Charles Grassley (R-     Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and John Cornyn (R-Texas), and      Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The fact that law      enforcement leadership throughout the nation supported the      reform effort made no difference to Senator And      unfortunately, his actions as U.Attorney for the Southern      District of Alabama only further illustrate his indifference      to this crisis. For example, drug convictions made up 40      percent of his cases when he served in that position--twice      the rate of other federal prosecutors in       Despite the current trend of focusing resources on violent      crime, and away from out-dated drug war policies, Senator      Sessions continues to oppose any attempts to legalize      marijuana and any reduction in drug sentences. As Attorney      General, he could direct federal prosecutors throughout the      country to pursue the harshest penalties possible for even      low-level drug offenses, a step that would further exacerbate      our national record of incarcerating non-violent offenders--     the vast majority of whom could be successfully treated, at      far lower cost to society, with appropriate healthcare      treatment.       Nor should Senator Sessions be trusted to ensure equal      access to voting rights. He has publically called the Voting      Rights Act ``intrusive,'' and has insisted that its proactive      protections of racial minorities were no longer necessary.      This is especially disturbing as Senator Sessions voiced      public support for voter-ID laws, while his home state      recently tried to close over thirty DMV offices, many in      majority-black areas, shortly after instituting strict voter-     ID requirements. We are reminded of the words of Coretta      Scott King in her letter opposing Jeff Sessions' nomination      to the federal district court in 1986: ``The irony of ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS873-2.txt,172,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,6.0,February
12273,topic-id,3119,"I also note that the National Nurses United, on behalf of 150,000 registered nurses, also urge the opposition to this nominee. And the record of this individual has made these individuals concerned about the resources and focus on crimes and actions that they see in their day-to-day lives.  They want to make sure they are going to work effectively in addressing these issues that they see through the health care system. All of these issues add up to a great deal of concern about this next vote that we are going to be taking.[[Page S897]]  We are not under the illusion that somehow, magically, the vote is going to turn out any differently than it did on the last nominee. Why are we here at 4:30 in the morning to talk about this? Why are we going to continue to pursue efforts, as the minority, to get time to discuss these nominees? We are going to do that because we have great concerns about their record. And, frankly, in the case of the next two nominees who are coming before us, we had specific questions asked about their actual actions and statements and the testaments before the Finance Instead of the majority answering those questions for us, they decided not to answer them and push the vote to the floor of the United States  I am very concerned about the Price nomination, and the discussion that I hope we are going to have time to have here on that nomination and to bring light to the issues that we didn't get to bring to light in the Finance  The Treasury nominee that we will give time to in the next several days, the discussion of that record, the things I am interested in, obviously, are the protection of Medicare and Medicaid, and making sure we expose what is the concept and idea to either cap or cut the benefits that Americans are getting under those programs today and to have a great discussion about a very important issue that was talked about during the campaign and was put into party platforms on both sides of the aisle, but now all of a sudden seem to be forgotten. That mysterious, but all-important issue, something called Glass-Steagall, the separation of commercial and investment banking. That is what the Trump campaign, now President Trump, working with Republicans, put into a platform. Let us have Glass- Let us have separation of commercial and investment banking. Why? Because it is the disaster that brought us the implosion of our economy and cost our economy $14 trillion, according to the Dallas fed. Yet, many Americans have not fully recovered from that event. I get that a lot of banks have recovered because we gave them the keys to the Treasury, and they got bailed out, but a lot of everyday Americans have not recovered. And certainly there are pension issues in the questioning of nominee There was some discussion, ``Well, that is not what we meant. That is in the party platform, but that is not what we meant, and that is not what we are going to pursue.'' And certainly the rollback of Dodd-Frank provisions, that were just done in a Congressional Review Act, without very much discussion or fanfare or understanding by the American public, these kinds of actions are the things we seek debate on.  As these nominees come right after this, my constituents in the State of Washington are feeling as if these nominees need to be questioned on how they are going to uphold existing law and how they are going to implement and enforce existing law as it relates to these many issues. We are doing our best here. We would rather not do it at 4:30 in the morning. We would rather not do it at 4:30 in the morning, but we will do it at 4:30 in the morning if that is what it takes to get the airing on these issues and this amount of attention.  So I do find that the other side of the aisle, trying to gavel down my colleague from Massachusetts, was an attempt to try to say that you can control this debate. You can control the questions we have or the discussions we want to have or the concerns that our constituents have, which are real. I don't think it takes a genius to see that many people marching in Seattle on women's issues or an attorney general or a Governor who files a case or all the discussion that is happening, as I said, in response to a bombing at a health clinic just within the last few years or a bombing that happened in Spokane, an attempt on a Martin Luther King Day parade just several years ago, where somebody left a backpack trying to do harm--these are issues today.  They may be the same struggles that our Nation has had, but we have made it through, and we want a law enforcement officer in the land to uphold the law, enforce it, and to fight for the civil liberties of these individuals.  So I go back to my opening comments about this. And that is that I truly believe that mark that was set in the Saturday night massacre is the mark we should always strive for. I happened to ask at the time, when I first got on the Senate, I sat on the Judiciary Commission for 2 years, and I asked Attorney General Ashcroft about these issues. I asked him specifically, if you become the Attorney General for the Nation--at this time we had a law that had been implemented, the roadless area rule. Even though it had become the force of law, would he enforce that, even though the new President wanted to overturn it? Because I wanted to get across this very issue: Are you working for the American people? Will you uphold the law if, in fact, that is the law of the country? At this point in time, Mr.Ashcroft hesitated about whether it did have the force of law but said that if it did have the force of law, he would certainly uphold it. Obviously, we saw a lot of Executive orders in the early days of the Bush administration trying to overturn many of these things, and we saw an Attorney General's office that stood by. Instead of defending these laws in court, basically they were effective at not implementing fighting them because basically they did a very poor job in the court process--or decided not to argue or to file on behalf of the existing law, as opposed to answering to the Senate of the United  So we have seen examples of this. We have seen examples of Attorneys General who are responding more to the President of the United States than upholding the laws of the land.  I think Americans--at least the Washingtonians who are writing me in record numbers, who are speaking out in record numbers, who are concerned in record numbers--want the laws on the book to be enforced, and they want the steps they are taking and making progress on as a State to also work in coordination with the next Attorney  I will be honest with people. I did not vote for the law to legalize marijuana in my I did not vote for it. I did not think that given some challenges and issues we had, it was the right thing to do. That is how I cast my vote. But more than 20 counties in our State, out of 39, voted for this law. It is not something that just Seattle did and it dominated the State, and there were just a bunch of people in Seattle who wanted to legalize marijuana; it was counties throughout our Some of our most rural counties voted for the legalization of that product.  In the ensuing years, we have had a good relationship with the Attorney General and the Department of Justice on how that law was going to continue to play out. So, as you can imagine, it is a much more integrated system now several years later. Several questions still remain about how this country is going to address that issue as a nation as a whole.  But right now, right now, we want to know we are going to have an Attorney General, and my obligation to a citizenry who has passed by initiative this decision is to make sure that I am looking for people here who are going to work with the State of Washington on that right that our State has to continue to move forward.  So it is of concern. As I said, the notion that a previous Attorney General did not agree--not this past Obama administration, but the previous Bush administration literally came to our State when we had a medical marijuana law and forced the investigation and shutdown of some facilities, caused great concern to medical patients throughout our So this is raising a question for people here. It is my obligation to make sure these issues are raised and brought up as we seek this discussion on the Sessions nomination to be Attorney General for our country.  I again thank my colleagues for being out here and for all of the discussions we have had on these issues. We should not be afraid to have these discussions. We should not be afraid to think about how we are going to work not only across the aisle, as I have done with my colleague Susan Collins on those homeland security Court issues--we worked successfully with Jeh Johnson, the last Homeland Security director, to make sure that we were moving some of our airport border control issues to overseas airports. We were able to get that done in December[[Page S898]]after the San Bernardino event and make sure that we are now working.  Why do we want them over there? Why do we want the border control and efficiency over there? Because then you can work more in coordination with law enforcement about who bad actors are before they reach the shores of the United By working with local law enforcement in those countries, we have better ways to find information about individuals we have concerns about. That is the best nexus for us, and so she and I have worked on that issue.  As I mentioned earlier, Senator Collins and I are big advocates for the use of biometrics because you can identify people. As I mentioned, in the Ressam case, if we had identified Ressam the first time he entered France, we would have known who he was when he got to It would not have taken him going to the U.border. We would have found out when he arrived in But this is the United States using our clout and using our efforts to say to our European counterparts: We have implemented these biometric standards, and we want you to implement them, and we want to work together to make sure people we have great suspicion and concern about are being addressed.  So, yes, we can work across the aisle on these issues. We can find ways to make sure that we are protecting civil liberties and also addressing the most heinous of these crimes and working to find individuals in a cooperative fashion, knowing that we are going to have to do this on an international basis.  So I urge our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to think about what America now needs in moving forward on the protection of civil liberties. I hope that--I am sure it is tempting to want to reach and to do some of these issues in Executive orders.  I mentioned the other issues of government surveillance in the Pacific Northwest that the State of Washington for sure has concerns about. These are our issues.  Infringing on the civil liberties of American citizens is not a pursuit we should be following. We should be working in coordination with law enforcement on verifying that people are who they say they are and pursuing an agenda, working with our international counterparts, to stop people in those countries before they even plot a case like the Ressam case in the State of  I know my other colleagues will be showing up here shortly, but I just wanted to put an additional note in. If any of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are up early and just happen to turn on the television, if that is one of the things they do in the morning--we asked our colleagues to give us ample time to debate on the Price and Mnuchin nominations. We can continue to do the all-night thing. We can. I feel for the floor staff and the people who are here all night and the extra strain that it puts on the stenographers who are here and have been working around the clock. But what we want is to have a hearing on the issues we are concerned about. We want to be able to have these issues discussed not necessarily in the middle of the night but during the broad daylight so that we can engage the American people on what these choices are so that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will hear from their constituents and will hear why these issues are so important.  In the two cases we are going to see following this nomination for Attorney General, we are going to individuals who did not fully respond and answer the questions we wanted answered as it related to information they supplied to the Finance  So when you talk about--some people say: Why are you guys doing this? We say: Well, it is the Treasury nominee and the head of our health care system. So basically it represents all our revenue and a big chunk of our spending. That is what those two individuals represent. They represent the revenue that our country raises and a big chunk of the money. In fact, I think health care is 7 percent of our economy. It represents a big aspect of our economy--those two individuals. So we want to make sure we have ample time to discuss those nominees, to raise the questions we have about those nominees. Maybe in that discussion here on the Senate floor in the bright light of day, we will get some answers. We will get some answers about some of the things that were discussed in the hearing about opposition to certain issues or incorrect information. We will engage our colleagues in a debate, and maybe they can help us understand the support for ideas like basically, you know, changing Medicare into a program that caps the benefits on individuals or taking Medicaid and doing the same thing.  I am a big proponent of changes in delivery system reform that have driven great efficiencies into the health care system. I think many of our colleagues don't know, for example, about a program that got people out of nursing homes and into community-based care; that a lot of States in the country that use this part of the Affordable Care Act now are driving more efficient health care services into those States--a lot of States that did not support President Obama, did not support the Affordable Care Act, but took the money from the Affordable Care Act and are now implementing a much better delivery system for those who are living longer and need assistance on health care.  Why is that so important? Because back to my point about Glass-Steagall and the implosion of our economy, what we are going to see is a very great tragedy on retirement issues. We are going to see a lot of people who don't have enough money to retire and certainly not enough to take care of their health care. So what happens then? Those individuals end up on If they end up on a Medicaid system that is based on nursing home care, the U.Government is going to be paying a lot more money for those services.  Those are all issues that we want to discuss with our colleagues, and we want to have an opportunity to do so during the next several days. We hope you will give us the ability to do that instead of holding all-night sessions--do that during the day--and give us ample time on those nominees and push those to next week so that we can have that discussion now.  Again, I want to thank the floor staff and everybody who has been here these two nights. It is a long haul. It is a long haul to do there. But behind every Member who has spoken on my side of the aisle, I can tell you, there is a passion of our constituents. There are true concerns, both by individuals and I would say businesses, as you can probably see from those who joined the case Washington State brought. You can see that there are issues here of how our economy works and how businesses work as well.  The passion and fervor that drive people to come here and speak on these issues is really one that represents the whole society we in the Northwest represent, the economic issues and the challenges that we face and how we have lived together in the diversity that has emerged and how much that diversity in the Pacific Northwest has grown our economy. That is what people are telling us. People want to know: What is the economic engine of the Pacific Northwest? And one of the things that scientists and researchers come up and say is that it is diversity.  The diversity adds to the creativity, the creativity adds to the inventiveness and the ingenuity, and the ingenuity is what is propelling these various businesses all across the various sectors. I am not just talking about high-tech sectors; I am talking about in agriculture, in aerospace, certainly in tech, but in many other aspects of manufacturing as well. So we want a nominee for Attorney General who is going to recognize that diversity, fight for that diversity, who is going to stand up to the President of the United States when they need to stand up and continue to make the effort that previous Attorney Generals have made in doing the job that it takes to be the top law enforcement officer in the land of the United  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

12241,topic-id,553,"Mr.President, I rise today, as I have on a number of occasions in the past, to express the urgent need for action to protect the retirement security of our Nation's coal miners. Because of bankruptcies that have decimated the coal industry, we have lost over 22,000 jobs in our State, but more than 22,000 retired coal miners and their spouses are at risk of losing their healthcare benefits at the end of April.[[Page S2184]]  I have visited with retired miners from all across West Virginia to discuss this situation. During the February congressional recess, I visited the Cabin Creek Health Center in West The Cabin Creek Health Center serves hundreds of coal miners and their families. They provide pulmonary rehabilitation services for miners suffering from black lung. They also provide primary care services for miners and other members of their community. During my visit, I met with several retired miners who would lose their health insurance coverage if Congress fails to act. These individuals are suffering from serious medical conditions and were unsure how they would afford their healthcare if they were to lose their current coverage.  Just 2 weeks ago, I met with about a dozen retired miners from West Virginia who came to Washington to support the Miners Protection Act and to stand up for their hard-earned retirement benefits. Other groups of West Virginia miners have come to Washington over the past few months. All have carried one message to Congress: Keep the promise of our lifetime health benefits. On March 1, thousands of miners received notice that their health insurance would be terminated in 60 days. Most of these same people received that very same message just last As I listen to their stories, it is hard to imagine the worry these notices cause for miners and their families.  In December 2016, Congress included language in the continuing appropriations legislation that preserved health coverage for these retired miners for just 4 months. While that provision kept mining families from losing their health coverage--which is good--at the end of last year, a permanent solution is critically needed.  The 4-month provision from the December CR expires at the end of this month. It is vital--vital--that Congress take action within the next few weeks to provide healthcare and peace of mind for these miners in West Virginia and across coal country. Our retired miners deserve their promised healthcare coverage and should not have to receive another cancellation notice or another Band-Aid solution. We have a bipartisan vehicle for action. I have worked closely with Senator Joe Manchin, Senator Rob Portman, and others to introduce and promote the bipartisan Miners Protection Act, which would preserve healthcare and pension benefits for our miners. Our bill passed the Senate Finance Committee last year by a bipartisan vote of 18 to 8. I also would like to thank the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, because he has introduced legislation that would provide a permanent healthcare solution for our miners.  With all of us pulling together and with us working together, I am confident the Senate will act before the end of this month to continue these critical healthcare benefits for our miners. I ask my colleagues for their support in addressing this important issue for our working families.

12349,topic-id,2580,"Mr.President, I also rise this evening to talk about the nomination of our colleague from Alabama, Senator Jeff Sessions, to serve as our next Attorney  Like many of our colleagues, I have heard from an incredible number of people in my State regarding this nomination--some in favor, fewer than 100--many against. Almost 1,300 Delawareans have called, emailed, or written to my office, expressing their opposition to Senator Sessions' nomination.  I would like to share, if I could, just a few excerpts from some of the emails that I have received concerning this nomination.  We will start with Priscilla from the town of Newport in the northern part of our She wrote to me about the experience of her family growing up in a segregated society. Here is what she had to say. She said:       I lived through my parents not having the right to vote,      not being able to go through the front door of a restaurant      or doctor's office, using the colored fountains and      bathrooms. Never again.  Another person, Rhonda from Dewey Beach wrote to me about Senator Sessions' voting record on voting rights. Here is what she had to say. She said:       Mr.Sessions has called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a      ``piece of intrusive legislation.'' Under him, the Justice      Department would most likely focus less on prosecutions of      minority voter suppression and more on rooting out mythical      voter fraud.  Here is one from Wilmington, DE--my hometown now--from a woman named She wrote to me about her concerns as a parent of a child with autism. She wrote these words:       I am writing to express my deep concern with Jeff Sessions'      nomination for Attorney I am a parent of an autistic      son and am terrified that people with these types of views      will be in power to enforce (or not) the laws that protect      the rights of my son and so many others.  Mr.President, the common theme throughout these letters, these calls, these emails is their fear that Senator Sessions will not be an Attorney General for all  I know that many of my colleagues--our colleagues--will soon be voting[[Page S960]]their hopes by voting to confirm Senator Sessions to be our next Attorney General, but too many of my constituents, including African Americans, immigrants, women, Muslims, and other vulnerable populations, have called and emailed my office in numbers that I don't think I have ever seen before to express their fears and to ask me to do something about it as their senior  I have heard their voices loud and clear, and I feel compelled to add my voice to so many others in opposing this nomination.  Let me just say this as clearly as I can. I do so with no joy, no joy.  Last night, as I was thinking about what I wanted to share on the floor this evening, my mind drifted back to another time and place.  The Presiding Officer may not know this. I grew up in Danville, VA, my sister and I, the last capital of the I got there I think when I was just about 9 years old and left when I was about to finish high school.  The home that we lived in right outside of Danville, VA--if you walked out the front door, about 100 yards down the road on the other side was a church, Woodlawn Baptist That was our church, and my mom dragged my sister and me there every Sunday morning, every Sunday night, every Wednesday night, and most Thursday nights.  When my sister and I were in high school, we stood on the doorstep of that church Monday through Friday when school was in session, and we would catch a school bus. About 200 yards down the road, on Westover Drive, there was another school bus stop, where African-American kids got on their school bus, 200 yards away. We would drive in our school bus 10 miles to our school, Roswell High School, and the kids at the other school bus stop would get in their bus, and they would drive past our school another 10 miles to get to their school.  On weekends, my dad worked a lot. He was in the Navy Reserve as a chief petty officer. He was gone a lot on the weekends. My mom worked in downtown Danville in the five-and-dime store. My sister and I would catch a bus, and we would ride downtown to go have lunch with my mom on many Saturdays when we were 9, 10, 11, 12 years old.  I couldn't help but notice when we got on the bus that if you were White, you got to sit up front, and if you were Black, you sat in back. We would go to a blue plate diner with my mom at lunchtime. There was one section where, if you were White, you got to eat there, and another section where, if you were Black, colored, you would eat there. To go to the restrooms, it was colored only, White only.  After lunch, my sister and I would go to Rialto Theatre in Danville, and my mom would give us each a quarter. And for 25 cents, we could see that afternoon three movies until she was finished with work, and we would go home together. At that Rialto Theatre, if you were White, you sat down in front on the first floor; if you were Black, you sat up in the balcony.  I will never forget that when I was a little boy in Danville, one day, I went to the dentist's office for some dental care. I remember this older African-American woman coming into the dentist's office, and she was in pain with I think an abscessed tooth.  She said: I know I don't have an appointment, but could someone just help me out of my misery?  They said: I am sorry, ma'am. You don't have an appointment. We can't do anything for you. And she left crying.  My parents--it turns out I am a Democrat; they were Republican, as far as I know. They got to vote, and they got to vote regularly. But I will bet you dollars to doughnuts that the kids at that bus stop who caught that bus to go to that all-Black, all-African-American school, my guess is that a bunch of them didn't get to vote because of something we had in Virginia called a poll tax.  Among the lessons that my sister and I learned at Woodlawn Baptist Church was the Golden Rule: Treat other people the way we want to be treated.  Among the things that we learned at that church is Matthew 25: We should care for the least of these. When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was thirsty, did you give me a drink? When I was sleeping in prison, did you visit me? When I was a stranger in your land, did you welcome me? And we were taught: yes, yes, yes, yes.  Micah 6. In my church this past Sunday, the question was raised: What is expected of us by the Lord? And we received three answers. And the three answers: Do justice, love kindness, walk humbly with thy  I have taken those lessons from my childhood, and those are lessons from my own church today. And I want to tell you that as a kid growing up in Danville, VA, I can understand how other kids in my community were racist or bigoted. I can understand how it happened in Alabama or North Carolina, where our Presiding Officer is from.  But somewhere along the line, somebody got ahold of me and said: You know all that stuff you are talking about in church and the Bible? If you really believe it, here is how you should act and talk and speak. And finally it sunk in.  I just want to say that Jeff Sessions has been my colleague. I have been here for 16 years. He has been my friend and colleague for 16 years. We read the same There have been times where we read it together over the years. When we met in my office just a few weeks ago, we talked about how our faith guides us in our lives. I reminded him of how Matthew 25 talks about moral obligations, ``the least of these,'' which I have talked about.  As I carefully considered my friend's nomination to serve our country in such a critical role, I found that while we agree on many issues, including that our faith is an important guide not only in our personal lives but in our capacity as public servants, I found that our views on too many important issues diverged.  Like many Americans, I am troubled by the direction Donald Trump is seeking to take our country in these first few weeks of his administration. I believe that an independent Attorney General can provide a check on this President's legal recklessness, and it may be more necessary now than at any point in recent history. Donald Trump has already revealed an agenda that reflects his divisive campaign, one that I believe will make our economy less robust, less fair, our environment less clean, our country less inclusive, our freedoms less free, and our allies less inclined to take America at its word.  Many of us worry that Jeff Sessions will not be the independent check on this administration that we need, and many of us worry that Jeff will not hold our Justice Department to the principles that everyone, no matter their age, income, sex, or color, deserves equal protection under the law. My colleagues and I have these concerns with a number of Cabinet nominees. I voted for more of them than I voted against.  Having said that, we need individuals to serve in these key posts who are willing to speak truth to power. Ironically, that is what got Acting Attorney General Sally Yates in trouble. She did it a few days ago when she was fired for refusing to defend the Muslim ban because she thought it might not be lawful.  Throughout the campaign, Senator Sessions supported a religious-based test for immigrants, and I fear that Senator Sessions is unlikely to stand up to Donald Trump and tell him that he is wrong on this front. To be honest with you, I just believe we need somebody who will do that, and unfortunately I fear there is a good chance that Senator Sessions believes Donald Trump just might be right. I am also afraid that Senator Sessions won't be the independent check our country is likely to need, especially in this administration.  Ultimately, however, the votes are where they are, and it appears that our friend, our colleague, Senator Sessions, will be our country's next chief law enforcement officer and chief attorney. Over these past days and weeks, I thought about whether our friend is the best person for the job, as I have said. I know others have too. I also thought about the millions of Americans who fear that he may have views about different races and minorities that could seep into the Justice Department, resulting in an unequal applications of our country's laws.  My thoughts have led me to the example of Lyndon Johnson, a man from[[Page S961]]the South who served, as you may recall, in the U.House of Representatives in Texas for a number of years and later suddenly became President under tragic circumstances, as we all recall, in November of 1963. LBJ didn't just oppose civil rights while in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, he often bragged about it. But he went through a public transformation that would lead him to pass the first civil rights bill since reconstruction as Senate majority leader in 1957 and then signed into law some of our Nation's landmark civil rights laws--the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Act, the Fair Housing Act, and countless others.  LBJ's transformation didn't happen overnight, though. The truth is that his views on civil rights and racial justice might have been there all along.  Here is what Robert Caro wrote about LBJ in the most recent installment on his life:       Although the cliche says that power always corrupts, what      is seldom said, but what is equally true, is that power      always reveals. When a man is climbing, trying to persuade      others to give him power, concealment is necessary: to hide      traits that might make others reluctant to give him power, to      hide also what he wants to do with that power. If men      recognized the traits or realized the aims, they might refuse      to give him what he wants. But as a man obtains more power,      camouflage is less necessary. The curtain begins to rise. The      revealing begins.  So it was, in Caro's view--and I think he is probably right--so it was with Lyndon  Mr.President, that reminds me of another quote tonight. This is one from our former First Lady Michelle Obama, who said these words: ``Being President doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are.''  It reveals who you are.  We are not confirming Jeff Sessions to be our next President, but we are confirming him to be our next Attorney General, and we must ask, as the curtain rises, what will it reveal? What will it reveal about Jeff Sessions?  Unfortunately, each time Jeff's career has led to more power, whether it was district attorney in Alabama, attorney general for his State, or as U.Senator, it has revealed a Jeff Sessions who is much the same as he has always been. It has revealed Jeff Sessions to be less inclined to undergo the transformation that so many others before him have undergone to put themselves and our Nation on the right side of history.  I will close with this thought: If Senator Sessions is confirmed, it is my sincere hope that our friend and our colleague will recognize the awesome responsibility and the opportunity he has to serve not only the people of Alabama, not only the people of the South or the Southeastern part of our country, but Americans across our country of all races, all colors, all creeds. In this body, it is often important that we vote with our hopes rather than our fears, and unfortunately, tonight I am not yet prepared to vote my hopes. But the words of a reporter writing about President Johnson a few years ago give me some hope as we look forward, and maybe they will give hope to the rest of us. Here is what that reporter wrote about Lyndon Johnson:       Perhaps the simple explanation, which Johnson likely      understood better than most, was that there is no magic      formula through which people can emancipate themselves from      prejudice, no finish line that when crossed, awards a      person's soul with a shining medal of purity in matters of      race. All we can offer is a commitment to justice in word and      deed that must be honored but from which we will all      occasionally fall short.  And I would just add, and we do.  I hope these words I have just quoted resonate with our friend and colleague, Senator Jeff If they do, both he and our country will be better for it.  With that, I yield the floor.

12284,topic-id,1435,"Mr.President, I want to outline a number of concerns that I have this morning about Senator Sessions' nomination to be the next Attorney I will try to keep it to a short list. I have limited time this morning. But I wanted to start with the voting rights issue.  In our State of Pennsylvania, we have a long history of litigation and battles about the right to vote. And when the Supreme Court decision in Shelby v. Holder was issued a couple of years ago, folks in the Senate took one, two, or three different positions. The position that I took was one of disagreement with the basic holding of Shelby v. Holder, which in my judgment gutted the Voting Rights Act's requirements that certain States and certain jurisdictions with histories of discrimination seek what is called preclearance from the Federal government before changing voting rules. That was a substantial change from the policies that had been in place for years.  Since the Shelby decision, more than half of the so-called preclearance States have implemented restrictive voting laws--some as soon as the very next day after the decision was handed down. And over 800 polling places in preclearance States alone have been closed since the decision. So on this issue, it is a basic difference of opinion.  I think Shelby was decided the wrong way, and Senator Sessions believes it was decided the right way. That is a fundamental disagreement. I have real concerns about an Attorney General who would have that position or that point of view on that case. I don't know for sure what he would do as Attorney I can't predict that, but I can certainly raise concerns about that decision.  When you think about what led to decisions like that over time, it is hard to encapsulate when you are speaking on the Senate floor all of the misery, all of the suffering, all of the trauma to individuals, all of the trauma that our country endured first to get the right to vote for every American and then to enforce the law and to make it real. There is no way--if I had 9 hours on the floor, I probably couldn't encapsulate or do justice to all of that work. So it is a fundamental divide, a fundamental debate about voting rights.  As someone who represents Pennsylvania, we have a particular interest in the issue of voter ID laws. They are the kinds of laws that follow the Shelby decision. Some of them predated But we had a major debate in Pennsylvania back in 2012, where the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed--meaning the House and Senate passed--and the Governor signed into law a voter ID law. Then litigation commenced and went all the way through the court system in The final decision was that the law was struck down. The voter ID law was struck down, so it is a major point of contention in  Over time, some have asserted that there is widespread voter fraud. We have heard that even more recently. I am still waiting for the evidence of that, but that is certainly an issue that we will continue to debate here in  I think the last thing we need in the United States of America is more restrictive voter ID laws. We should be hoping we can expand the opportunity for people to vote. Where there are barriers erected, knock them down. Where there are impediments to the right to vote, push through them or put in place strategies to overcome them.  Again, I think that is just the basic difference between Senator Sessions and me, in terms of our approach to voter ID laws. We had a searing experience in Pennsylvania, which left a lasting impression on the people of our  Another issue, which I think is of critical importance in every administration at every time, but maybe ever more so today with regard to this new administration: The administration now is in a major litigation battle regarding what has been described as a travel ban. It is probably shorthand, but that is my best description of it. It has been a matter that has been litigated in several U.Federal district courts, and now it is in front of an appellate court. Who knows, the next step after this may be the U.Supreme I raise that not to debate the substance of it; we can do that for a long while, I guess, but I raise it on the question of independence.  There are certain jobs in government--I had one of them in State government. I was elected as a State auditor general in I served two terms. In that job, for example, at the State level, the most important quality or metric by which you are judged is your independence. You are either independent or not. And if you are independent, you can do auditing investigations that demonstrate that independence. Then you are doing what the people expect.  At the Federal level, even though the Attorney General is appointed by a President, I also believe the Attorney General has to demonstrate independence every day, in every decision, in every interaction with our government or with citizens across the country. I hope that Jeff Sessions can do that, were he to be confirmed. I have some doubts, not only based upon the recent campaign statements made, but I also have some significant concerns in light of what has happened recently.  I would hope, and I think every American has a reasonable expectation, that any Attorney General will be totally independent when it comes to basic questions of law and justice, even if they agree with the President on a number of issues. I have some doubts in the case of this nominee.  So independence is a significant concern across the country. We have had a long debate in this country. Part of it, I think, came to closure a couple of years ago in the Supreme Court with regard to marriage equality. That worked its way through the courts, as well. I was in support of, and happy about, the decision the Supreme Court made on marriage equality.  It is another basic difference that I have with the nominee for Attorney Once again, I think that is one of those basic issues that divides the parties. It doesn't mean you can't work together. It doesn't mean you can't have a good relationship. But I would hope that the Attorney General of the United States, of either party, would make sure that decision as it relates to marriage equality would be enforced and that it would be the subject of some praise or at least some rhetorical support for the outcome in that case.  I think the country took a step in the right direction, where every American, whether they are gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender, was finally accorded the full measure of respect, the full measure of inclusion, when it came to the issue of marriage. That is another basic disagreement that we have.  We don't know what the outcome of this confirmation vote will be. I think we have some sense of it, but regardless of the final outcome, these differences will remain. We have to be honest about basic, fundamental differences, and that is one of the reasons we have a confirmation process. That is why we have advice and consent. That is why we have hearings and hundreds, if not thousands, of questions because each of these nominees is granted enormous power. In some instances--unlike Senator Sessions--but[[Page S908]]in some instances, they are appointed to positions where they will have substantial impact on people's lives for years. Tens of millions of Americans' lives will be impacted by their decisions, so they should have to go through a thorough vetting process and a very rigorous ultimate confirmation process because they are being accorded great power, and they are servants of the people. They have to remember that is what their job is: to be servants.  I know some want to shorten or truncate or make easier this path to confirmation for all of these Cabinet nomination positions. I think the people expect a thorough vetting, and we are still in the midst of that with regard to several of these positions.  So I just wanted to outline my objections--or I should say disagreements with--Senator I will be voting no on his nomination.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

12457,topic-id,1966,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to speak about the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Every Member of the United States Senate has an obligation to review this nomination thoroughly and to make a determination. I believe the advice and consent duty of a Senator--certainly in my case, when I make decisions about any judge for confirmation, but especially for the Supreme Court--has to be a decision grounded in a review of a number of considerations. I think they are generally the same no matter who the nominee is, but sometimes they can vary. I think in this case there are probably additional considerations that I weighed.  Of course, we want to look at the nominee's character and their integrity, certainly their judicial temperament. Someone can be very capable as a judge and very learned in the law, but they may not have the temperament or the integrity.  I don't think there is any question that there is nothing in the record that indicates that Judge Gorsuch doesn't have the experience or the character and integrity to do this job, and to do it with the kind of temperament we have the right to expect from any judge.  I also believe at the same time, though, that you have to do a review of the cases decided by the nominee--in this case, a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, a very similar kind of job to that which the Supreme Court Justice does. You are reviewing cases on appellate court. In Judge Gorsuch's case, it is the Tenth Circuit--not the Supreme Court, but still appellate court decisions.  Part of that inquiry I believe is a review of an assessment, really, of this individual's judicial philosophy. That is where I will spend most of my time tonight. I will also talk about the rule change that might be upon us.  While reading Judge Gorsuch's opinions, I developed very serious concerns about his rigid judicial philosophy. Judge Gorsuch's opinions indicated, in my judgment, an extremely conservative judicial approach. This leads him to come down disproportionately on the side of powerful interests, against workers in many cases, and consumers in other cases--a cause for particular concern at a time when the Supreme Court itself, under Chief Justice Roberts, has become an ever more reliable ally to big corporations.  A major study published by the Minnesota Law Review in 2013, found that the four conservative Justices currently sitting on the Court are among the six most business friendly Supreme Court Justices since 1946. A review by the Constitutional Accountability Center shows the consequences of the Court's corporate tilt, finding that the national Chamber of Commerce has had a success rate of 69 percent in cases before the Roberts Court, a significant increase over previous courts. These are cases of serious importance to everyday Americans--cases involving rules for consumer contracts, challenges to regulations, ensuring fair play in labor standards, and attempts by consumers to hold companies accountable for product safety and much more.  Another concern I have about his nomination is that at some point in the campaign of last year, the Republican nominee was given a list of names from which he should choose, were he to be elected I would hope that there would be a list of names that any President would consider beyond what we are told in published reports was just 21 names, developed by organizations on the far right. And that fact alone causes me great concern--that the President is permitted, according to this arrangement, this understanding, only to consider a list of 21 names that those organizations developed.  The record of this judge indicates also that he would only exacerbate the problem that I pointed to with regard to the corporate tilt of the current Roberts In my judgment, by doing so, it would further stack the deck against ordinary workers and families. It starts with his basic judicial philosophy. He employs the narrowest possible reading of Federal law and shows extreme skepticism--even hostility--toward executive agencies or what some might call administrative agencies, agencies that carry out the law in areas like labor or consumer protections and the like.  Many have expressed concerns about his opinion in the Hobby Lobby case, where Judge Gorsuch endorsed the idea that owners of for-profit corporations can assert corporate religious liberty rights, opening the door potentially to widespread discrimination against LGBT Americans and other Americans as well. But a variety of other cases are equally illustrative of Judge Gorsuch's troubling approach to the law.  I will give you just a few examples. One case involved the tragic death of a trench hand who was electrocuted while working as part of an excavation crew. The court reviewed a ruling by the Department of Labor, punishing the mining company for failing to provide proper safety training to the worker. Judge Gorsuch mocked the Department of Labor's ruling as nothing more than a ``Delphic declaration'' devoid of necessary proof, and he concluded that the agency was wrong to penalize the company following the worker's death. Fortunately, a majority of the Tenth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the Department of Labor's ruling.  Another case involved a truckdriver who was stranded on the side of the road at night in subzero temperatures, with the brakes on his trailer frozen and the heater in his cab broken. He called dispatch for help multiple times, but after hours of waiting in the freezing cold, this truckdriver was having[[Page S2355]]trouble breathing, and his torso and his feet were numb. Worried about his safety, he unhitched his trailer, drove the truck away, and then later the company fired him for abandoning the trailer.  Three different authorities within the Department of Labor ruled against the company. Judge Gorsuch disagreed, parsing a Federal statute to argue that the driver was not protected in his decision to drive away, despite the risk of freezing to death if he stayed put. Again, fortunately, the majority of the Tenth Circuit Court disagreed, describing the judge's labored interpretation of the statute as ``curious,'' and ruling in favor of the truckdriver.  I have a basic disagreement with Judge Gorsuch's rulings regarding the legal protections for individuals with disabilities, especially students with disabilities. In one case, he ruled against parents who believed their autistic child was not receiving an adequate education at his public school. A hearing officer, an administrative law judge, and a U.district court all found in favor of the family, ruling that they were entitled to reimbursement for tuition at a residential program tailored for children with autism.  Judge Gorsuch reversed the rulings and, instead, articulated an extremely narrow interpretation of Federal law--this particular Federal law that protects students with disabilities, the IDEA law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education  In 2004, Congress amended the IDEA, in part, based upon findings that its implications have been ``impeded by low expectations.'' Nevertheless, Judge Gorsuch ruled that because the student in this case made some progress in public school, even though he could not generalize his learning to settings outside of school--which is the goal of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--the family, the judge believed, was not entitled to tuition reimbursement. That decision happened a number years ago.  It just so happens that the U.Supreme Court, the current Court with only 8 members, voted 8 to 0 against the basic position that Judge Gorsuch had in that education case--a different case but the same question about what is the duty owed by a school district to a child with a disability. That ruling happened to be announced during the week that Judge Gorsuch was in front of the Judiciary Committee--in fact, on one of the very days he was in front of the committee. A unanimous Court disagreed with his approach to those kinds of cases involving children with disabilities in a public school.  These cases and others are illustrative of a broader trend in the judge's jurisprudence, whether it is a case involving an employee seeking redress for work place discrimination, hospital staff fighting for back pay after an unlawful reduction in the work hours, or a victim of improper conduct by a medical device company looking for justice. Judge Gorsuch's approach produces rulings disconnected from the lived experience of those they impact.  Therefore, after review of many of his cases, after consideration of his judicial philosophy, and after a review, as well, of the current state of this Court--especially the corporate tilt of this current Roberts Court--I have concluded that I could not support Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  I wanted to add some comments before concluding tonight about what this vote may mean to the Senate and the rules of the It is my belief--others, of course, disagree--but it is my belief that if you seek to become an Associate Justice on the most powerful Court in the world, you ought to be able to garner the support of at least 60 members of the U.If your nomination to the Court is the subject of such consensus, you ought to be able to get 60 votes in the U.If both your nomination and your judicial philosophy is seen as such a mainstream nomination, you ought to be able to get 60 votes. Despite that, it is a point in time when we are having a debate about how we arrived at this question of a potential change in the rules. I believe that the reason we got here is because of substantial and unyielding obstruction by Republicans in the U.Senate over a number of years.  Just consider this: From the founding of our Nation, through President Obama's first term when Senate Republicans were in the minority, cloture--the motion to cut off debate and proceed to a final vote--has been filed in a total of just 147 nominations. Just 147 times in the total history of the U.Senate, the minority forced the majority to file cloture. Of all the Presidents before President Obama combined, cloture needed to be filed only on 68 of these nominations, but in President Obama's first term before Republicans took the majority of the Senate, Republicans refused to consent to votes and forced the Democratic leader to file cloture on 79 nominations--over 50 percent of all the cloture motions ever filed on nominations in the history of the U.So half of those cloture petitions were filed just in the last couple of years. That doesn't even include what I think was an outrageous obstruction that continued once Republicans took the majority, culminating, of course, in their refusal to consider Judge Merrick Garland's nomination. So Judge Garland, of the District of Columbia Circuit, the chief judge who had great support, I think, on both sides of the aisle--Judge Garland had maybe a few meetings, no vote, and not even a hearing before the Judiciary  According to the Congressional Research Service, President Obama is the only one of the five most recent Presidents whose first term was marked by nominations that languished for over half a year on average. Also in his first term, he was the only President of the previous five under whom the district court vacancies increased, unaccompanied by the creation of new judgeships to meet the demand. In fact, President Obama's district court nominees, during his first term, waited an average of 60 days longer for confirmation than those of President George  I think the evidence is overwhelming. Senate Republicans' obstruction of judicial nominations reached historic levels under President So we are here at this point, and we have to make a decision. My vote will be to insist on 60 votes; therefore, I will be voting no on cloture and also voting no on the nomination of Judge  I yield the floor.

12242,topic-id,2636,"Mr.President, yesterday the Senate Judiciary Committee voted out the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of Justice During the meeting, as the Presiding Officer knows, our Democratic colleagues trotted out the same old tired arguments we have heard time and again about Judge  In the end, though, none of those arguments hold water, and of course many of them aren't even about him. Instead, these arguments reveal how our colleagues across the aisle are grasping for reasons to justify an unprecedented partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court  Some object to the nomination of Judge Gorsuch because they claim he refuses to answer specific questions. But I ask: How would any of us feel if the judge before whom we might later appear had previously, in order to get a confirmation of his nomination, made certain promises of how he would judge that case when presented at a future date? We would all feel more than a little bit betrayed and even cheated if the judge had prejudged our case before he even heard it. The judge is simply engaging in a common practice for Supreme Court nominees. They steer clear of any questions that may pertain to cases they may have to rule on later. It is a matter, as the Presiding Officer knows, of judicial ethics, and we wouldn't have it any other way.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg set this precedent early on. During her confirmation hearing in 1993, she said she didn't want to give any hints or previews about how she might vote on an issue before her. So she politely and respectfully declined. Others followed her example, and Judge Gorsuch is, of course, doing precisely the same.  By any fair review, Judge Gorsuch has a history of 10 years as a judge sitting on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals out of Denver, He has a history of interpreting the law fairly, basing his judgments on the law and the facts, without regard to politics and without respect to persons.  That brings me to this argument that somehow he is against the little guy. Clearly, a review of the records demonstrates that this is not so. But, again, how are judges supposed to perform? Are they supposed to see the litigants--the parties to a lawsuit--in their court and say: Well, you have a big guy and you have a little guy, and I am always going to vote or render a judgment for the little guy without regard to the law or the facts?  I realize that sometimes our colleagues can weave a story that seems somewhat sympathetic when it comes to the fact that not everybody is guaranteed a win in court. As a matter of fact, when there are two parties to a lawsuit, one of those parties is likely to be disappointed in the outcome. But that is what judges are there for. That is what they are supposed to do. They are supposed to render judgments, without regard to personal preferences or politics or without regard to their sympathies, let's say, for one of the parties to the lawsuit.  Judge Gorsuch even said this during his hearing: No one will capture me. No one will capture me--meaning that no special interest group or faction would derail him from following the law, wherever it may lead. That is why Judge Gorsuch is universally respected. That is why he was confirmed by voice vote 10 years ago to the Tenth Circuit Court of No one objected to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation to a lifetime appointment on the Tenth Circuit Court of  Again, as the Presiding Officer knows, the Supreme Court of the United States only hears about 80 cases, give or take, a year. Most of the hard work gets done in our judicial system at the district court level and at the circuit court level, and almost all of the cases end in circuit courts, like the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, on which Judge Gorsuch serves. That is not to say that the Supreme Court is not important--it is--in resolving conflicts between the circuits or ruling on important questions of law to guide all of the judiciary and to settle these issues for our country, at least for a time, and maybe even permanently when it comes to constitutional interpretation.  Judge Gorsuch enjoys broad support from across the political spectrum, especially from his colleagues and members of the bar.  For 13 years, I served on the State judiciary in Texas, with 6 years as a trial judge and 7 years as a member of the Texas Supreme When I heard that Judge Gorsuch had participated in 2,700 cases on a three-judge panel and 97 percent of them were unanimous, that told me something special about this judge. It takes hard work to build consensus on a multijudge panel, whether it is three judges or nine judges, like the Supreme I think what we are going to see out of this judge is not somebody who is going to decide cases in a knee-jerk fashion but somebody who is going to work really hard to try to build consensus on the Supreme Court of the United  That is really important to the Supreme Court's respect as an institution of our government. What causes disrespect for our judiciary is when judges act like politicians, when they make pledges of how they will decide cases ahead of time or they campaign, in essence, for votes based on ideological positions.  Judge Gorsuch is the opposite of that, and that is the kind of judge America needs right now in the Supreme That is why later on this[[Page S2185]]week, on Friday, Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed.  In spite of all the evidence in support of the nominee's intellect and qualifications, without regard to the bipartisan chorus urging his confirmation, the Democratic leader has decided to do everything he can to prevent us from even having an up-or-down vote on his nomination. Unfortunately, he will be making history in urging his Democratic colleagues to engage in a partisan filibuster against a Supreme Court justice. In our Nation's long, rich history, there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Now, some people want to talk about Abe Fortas back in 1968, which was totally different. But there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court justice until, apparently, this week on Thursday--not one of them.  Not one of my Republican colleagues mounted a filibuster when President Obama nominated Justice Sotomayor or Justice Both received an up-or-down vote. That is because that has been the customary way this Chamber has treated Supreme Court nominees in the past. Only four times in our Nation's history has a cloture motion actually even been filed. But cloture was always achieved because, on a bipartisan basis, enough votes were cast to allow the debate to end and then to allow an up-or-down vote on the nominee.  To show how new this weaponization of the filibuster has become, back when Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, he got 52 votes--52 votes--and was confirmed and now serves on the Supreme Back when he was confirmed, no one even dreamed of its use. It was theoretically possible, but no one dreamed of the idea that someone would raise the threshold for confirmation from a 51-majority vote to 60.  Our colleagues have made it quite clear that they don't want to support any nominee from this So it is not even just about Judge It is about any nominee this President might propose to the Supreme And I think what it boils down to is this: Our Democratic colleagues haven't gotten over the fact that they lost the election. I think it really isn't much more complicated than that. They adamantly resisted participating in the legislative process. They dug their feet on every Cabinet nomination and now on the Supreme Court nomination. All they know is to obstruct because they haven't gotten over the fact that Hillary Clinton isn't President of the United  They keep bringing up Merrick Garland's name. Judge Garland is a fine man, a good judge who serves on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, but you would have to go back to 1888 to find a time when someone was nominated in a Presidential election year with divided government and where that person was confirmed.  What we decided to do upon the death of Justice Scalia is to say that the Supreme Court is so important that we are going to have a referendum on who gets to nominate the next Justice on the Supreme Our Democratic friends thought for sure it would be Hillary When it turned out to be Donald Trump, well, all bets were off, and they were in full opposition mode. But we would have respected the right of a President Hillary Clinton to fill that nomination because that is what we said was at stake in the election. I think it had a big impact on whom got elected on November 8 as President of the United States and who would fill that vacant seat and any future vacant seats on the Supreme  So here is the problem. If Judge Gorsuch is an unacceptable nominee, can you imagine any nominee by this President being acceptable to our Democratic colleagues? I can't, because Judge Gorsuch is about as good as you get when it comes to a nominee. He is exactly the type of person we should hope to see nominated to the Supreme  So it is time for our Democratic colleagues to accept reality and not to live in some sort of fantasy land and not to try to punish good people like Judge Gorsuch, who has done an outstanding job, because they are disappointed in the outcome of the election.  So here is the bottom line. Our Democratic friends will determine how we get to an up-or-down vote on Judge If they are genuinely concerned about the institution of the Senate, they will provide eight votes to get cloture to close off debate, they will decline to filibuster the judge, and they will allow an up-and-down vote on this imminently qualified nominee.  I am holding out hope that more thoughtful and independent Democrats will think better of the Democratic leader's strategy. Several already have, and I commend them for it. I hope more will come around to that idea, but as I and others have said before, regardless of whether they do, Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed. But it is up to the Democrats to determine just how we get that done.  I see a friend from Vermont here. I won't take much longer. I want to take about 3 or 4 minutes, maybe 5 minutes, to debunk some of the myths about how we got here.  I have in front of me an article written by Neil Lewis dated May 1, 2001. The title of this New York Times story is ``Washington Talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight.'' It is dated May 1, 2001. That was, of course, in the early days of the George Bush administration. What it says is that 42 of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private retreat in Farmington, PA, where the principal topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the White House on judicial nominees.  Mr.Lewis goes on to quote one of the people there who said: ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the ground rules'' by which judicial nominees were confirmed. And they did as a result of that meeting, which was led by Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago, and Marcia Greenberger, codirector of the National Women's Law Senator Schumer, the present Democratic leader, and others, cooked up a new procedural hurdle for President George Bush's judicial nominees, and we remember what happened after that. It became almost routine for our Democratic colleagues to filibuster President Bush's nominees.  Ultimately, there came a meeting of a group called the Gang of 14, where there was a deal worked out that some of President Bush's judicial nominees were confirmed and others were returned and not confirmed. There was a decision made at that time by the Gang of 14, a bipartisan group, that there would be no filibuster of judicial nominees, absent exceptional circumstances. That was the language that they used--``absent exceptional circumstances''--that let us get by that obstacle and those filibusters for a time.  The next major development occurred in 2013, when President Obama really wanted to see on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--the primary circuit court that reviewed administrative decisions--more of his Democratic nominees on that court. So in a new and unprecedented fashion, Senator Harry Reid changed the cloture rules once again--so-called the Reid For what purpose? It was a naked power grab. It was to pack the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--one of the least busy circuit courts in the country--in order to have judges confirmed by 51 Democratic votes that would rubberstamp President Obama's administrative actions during his administration. And sadly, it worked. They did just that.  So in a way, we are coming full circle, back to what the tradition in the Senate was before the year 2000, before Democrats went to this retreat led by liberal legal activists who cooked up this idea that you could filibuster judges, and they tried to impose a requirement of 60 votes for confirmation when, in fact, the Constitution contemplates a majority vote, or 51 votes for confirmation.  Some have said this represents the end of comity in the I don't believe that. Some have said this threatens the end of the legislative filibuster or cloture requirement. I don't believe that either. There is a big difference between a nominee by a President that is an up-or-down vote--confirm or don't confirm. There is a big difference between that and legislation, which by definition is a consensus-building process by offering an amendment, by offering other suggestions to build that consensus and get it passed.  You can't amend a nominee. All you can do is vote up or down. So I don't[[Page S2186]]believe restoring the status quo ante--going back before 2000 and restoring the 200-year-plus tradition of the Senate where you don't filibuster judges--I don't see that as a bad thing. I don't see it as the end of the legislative filibuster. It is completely apples and oranges.  It is true that 51 Senators will be able to close off debate and confirm Judge Gorsuch, and we will see that happen later this week. It also means that the next Democratic President can nominate a Supreme Court nominee, and that person will be confirmed by 51 votes. Again, this has been the 200-plus-year tradition of the I don't see that as the end of the I don't see this as somehow damaging our country--the restoration of the status quo before 2000, when our Democratic colleagues decided to weaponize the filibuster and use it to block judges based on this trumped-up idea that 60 votes would be required rather than 51.

12310,topic-id,2148,"Madam President, last night we all witnessed a rather extraordinary event. Certainly for the first time in my time in the Senate, we saw rule XIX of the Standing Senate Rules invoked. That rule says: ``No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.''  I certainly agree with the ruling of the Chair and the decision of the Senate as a body that that line was crossed last night. A Senator can't evade that rule by somehow claiming: These weren't my words; I was reading what somebody else said.  Specifically, in the case of our former colleague, now deceased, Senator Ted Kennedy claimed that the nominee for Attorney General was somehow a disgrace to the Justice Department and ought to resign. That certainly crossed that line.  Our colleagues want to point to a letter written by Coretta Scott That was part but not the whole of the speech given by the Senator from I hope that maybe we have all been chastened a little bit, and maybe we have all learned a little bit of a lesson here.  I yearn for the day when the Senate and, frankly, the country as a whole would pull back from the abyss of recrimination, personal attacks, and we would get back to doing what this institution was designed to do--which is to be a great body for deliberation and debate--and we would treat each other with the civility with which we would all want to be treated.  We are at a pretty challenging time in our Nation's history, when many people who were surprised and disappointed at the last election are unwilling to accept the results of that election and the verdict of the American people. I can only hope that, after the passage of some time, they will return to their senses, and they will agree that no one is well served by this race to the bottom in terms of decorum and in terms of rhetoric, in terms of how we treat one another. The American people are better served when we treat each other with civility and respect and when we don't make personal attacks against Senators because of the positions that they take.  This debate over the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions has taken on some rather unusual twists and turns. I want to comment briefly on some of the remarks made by our colleague from Minnesota about voting rights because I think this is exemplary of the way that Senator Sessions' record on voting rights has been misrepresented.  We all know that in 2006--those of us who were here in the Senate, including Senator Sessions, including the Democratic whip and myself--we all voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights That included section 2 and section 5, which was later struck down. Section 2 is the provision of the Voting Rights Act that applies to the entire Nation, and it authorizes a lawsuit to vindicate voting rights that are jeopardized by some illegal practice. Section 5, which was the subject of the decision by the U.Supreme Court in the Shelby County case that was decided in 2013--that was directed not at section 2, which applies to the entire Nation, but to section 5, which applied only to a handful of jurisdictions around the country. It was based on voting practices that existed in the middle 1960s.  I would be the first to admit that the record of vindicating the rights of minority voters in 1965 was nothing to be proud of. We have come a long way in this country, and it has been because of the Voting Rights It has been because of our collective commitment to the right of every citizen to vote that I believe those statistics which existed in the mid-sixties are no longer valid today.  In fact, if you look at many of the jurisdictions covered in the 1960s, including places like Alabama, where Senator Sessions is from, they have records of minority voting that are superior to jurisdictions that are not covered by section 5. How our colleagues across the aisle can somehow condemn Senator Sessions for the Supreme Court's decision in the Shelby County case, when he voted for the reauthorization of the entire Voting Rights Act, section 2 and section 5, strikes me as extremely misleading and unfortunate, but it does seem to characterize the nature of the debate about this nominee.  During his confirmation hearing, I said: Well, those who don't know Senator Sessions are interested to learn his record and his resume, but those of us who worked with him--we don't need to read his resume. We don't need to hear a recitation of his record. We know the man. We know what is in his heart. And he is a thoroughly decent and honorable Member of the Senate, and he will do an outstanding job, I believe, restoring the reputation of the Department of Justice, as one dedicated to the rule of law above all else.  There is always a risk--and this happens in Democratic administrations, as well as Republican administrations--when the Attorney General feels like they are an arm of the White That is not the job of the Attorney The President has a lawyer, White House The Attorney General is supposed to have some measure of independence even though he or she is appointed by the President and serves at the President's pleasure.  That is why we ask questions of people, like Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates: Can you tell the President no? Well, she said she could. And then ultimately, unfortunately, in the case of the Executive order that was issued by President Trump later on, said--even though this order was vetted by the Office of Legal Counsel and determined that this was a legal Executive order both in content and in form, she said: I still disagree with the President's Executive order, and I am going to order the Justice Department lawyers not to defend it.  Well, that is the kind of politics that we need none of in the Department of We have plenty of politicians in this country. We have plenty of politicians in the Congress and in the White We don't need another[[Page S923]]politician as Attorney In fact, we need a nonpolitician, an apolitician, somebody who believes that their allegiance to the rule of law, irrespective of who is involved, whether it is the President of the United States or the least among us--that is what the rule of law is all about. And that is one reason why I feel so strongly that Senator Sessions will be an outstanding Attorney General, because I believe he will restore the Department of Justice to an institution that believes in and enforces the rule of law above politics, and that is a fundamentally important thing to do.  We know Senator Sessions, as I said earlier, brings a lifetime of relevant experience to this job: former Federal prosecutor, former U.attorney for the Department of He said those were some of the best years of his life.  I once had a colleague who now serves on the Fifth When he became a U.district judge in San Antonio, he was recalling his days as U.attorney. He said--I still remember this after all these many years--he said he never had a prouder moment in his life than when he appeared in court and he said: ``I am here and I am ready on behalf of the United States of America.''  Senator Sessions is here, and he is ready to serve the American people as Attorney And we know from his service at the Department of Justice, as attorney general of Alabama, and now for the past 20 years in the Senate, that he is devoted to the rule of law and keeping our country safe. So it has really been sad to see interest groups vilifying him over and over again or people mischaracterizing him, as they have on his voting rights record, things that he is not responsible for after voting to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in 2006. He didn't decide the Shelby County case.  This is a man we have worked with for--some for 20 years, people who have been here that long with him, and we know Jeff Sessions to be a man who has dedicated his life to public service. Our colleagues across the aisle have offered him an occasional compliment, like the Democratic leader, who once called him straightforward and fair. The assistant Democratic leader called him a man of his word. But now the decision to drag out Cabinet nominations as long as possible and to waste valuable time that could be used on other bipartisan legislation--we know our Democratic colleagues have chosen to slow-walk the process, and I think it is a shame, particularly in the case of somebody whom we all know so well and who is dedicated to the Department of Justice and the restoration of the rule of law.  Several of us have talked from time to time about how the holding up of these nominees is unprecedented. At this point in President Obama's term, 21 Cabinet members were confirmed. Senator Sessions, when we vote on his nomination tonight, will be 8--21 to 8. You have to go back to George Washington to find a slower confirmation timeline for a new administration. There is no good excuse for it, particularly in light of the fact that now, under the Reid precedent, our colleagues across the aisle know that all of these nominees, particularly in the case of Senator Sessions, will be confirmed. So holding up the nomination just for delay alone makes no sense at all.  Well, some have said holding up Senator Sessions' nomination is somehow similar to the confirmation process for Loretta Lynch, but that really rings hollow on examination. Let me remind them what happened when Loretta Lynch was nominated as Attorney At the time, our Democratic friends were filibustering a bipartisan bill that later passed 99 to 0. They were filibustering a bipartisan anti-trafficking bill for no good reason. That is my view; they may think they had a good reason. I think actually what it had to do with was the Hyde amendment and the longstanding limitation on the use of taxpayer funds for abortion that had gone back to roughly 1976. They wanted to eliminate that restriction in this anti-trafficking bill, so they refused to consider that legislation, which many of them had cosponsored, to help thousands of victims of sexual exploitation, slavery, and human trafficking find a path to healing and restoration. So the majority leader, in an action that I completely endorsed, simply said that as soon as they dropped the filibuster, we would move on with the Loretta Lynch nomination. They did finally, and we processed her nomination. So in no way were those two situations similar.  Today, our colleagues across the aisle want to keep a new President from surrounding himself with the men and women he has selected to help run the country. I think if there is one thing that should give people more confidence in the new administration, it is the quality of the men and women he has chosen for his Cabinet, and I would add Vice President Pence, somebody we know here, having served 12 years in the House of  So the delay is really for no good reason at all and will have no achievable results. They are not going to be able to block the nomination but, rather, just try to score political points. And preventing an exemplary nominee from filling an important national security position I believe makes our country less safe.  I will give our colleagues across the aisle some credit for allowing the confirmation of Secretary of Defense James Mattis and John Kelly at the Department of Homeland Security and finally, after a long weekend, Mike Pompeo as Director of the Those are essential components of the President's national security Cabinet, but it also includes the Attorney General of the United States, someone whose nomination has been delayed until we vote on him tonight. After 9/11, the Attorney General became more than just a law enforcement officer; he became a counterterrorism official as well, integrally tied, with supervision of the FBI, to our efforts to protect the American people from terrorists who would kill us or our allies.  So there is really no good excuse for delaying the confirmation of Senator Sessions, and I am confident that tonight we will finally do what we should have done at least 3 weeks ago--confirm Senator Sessions as the next Attorney General of the United And I believe it is past time that we do so.

12269,topic-id,608,"Mr.President, I have to admit that this is a bittersweet moment for me. I come here tonight to express my support for Jeff Sessions' nomination to be the next Attorney General of the United It is a high honor, and the nominee is more than worthy. The truth is, I will be sad to see him go.  In all the time I have known Senator Sessions, I have found him to be a consummate gentleman. We actually met before I entered the It was 2013. I was serving in the House of Representatives--a first-term Senator Sessions, of course, was my elder in both age and rank. Yet he reached out to me humbly to discuss a hot topic--immigration. Back then, there was an effort afoot to force through Congress a massive immigration bill the American people clearly did not want. So the two of us worked together to stop it, and I am glad to say we were successful.  I took away more from that experience than an appreciation of the Senator's legislative skills. I got a sense of his character: how he saw the world, what he believed, and why. If I had to sum it up, I would say this is a man who loves the law--who has spent decades doing all he could.  Senator Sessions knows the law shouldn't be the spider's web of old, which catches the weak but cannot constrain the mighty. It is supposed to uphold the entire community so all Americans can thrive. What we have is a legal system that at its best strives to be a justice system.  I think if you look at Senator Sessions' career, you can see the same qualities represented by the balance, the blindfold, and the sword of Lady First, like the balance, he has a judicious mind--honed over his 12 years as a U.attorney and his 2 years as attorney general of the State of He evaluates the evidence carefully and comes to a well-considered[[Page S886]]conclusion. I would argue it is this very approach that led him to advocate for an immigration system that works for working I have every confidence, as our top law enforcement officer, he will keep the interests of American citizens uppermost in his mind.  Second, like the blindfold, he is impartial and fair-minded. I think of the fair sentencing law he passed, with bipartisan support, to bring harsh penalties that fell disproportionately on African Americans more in line with the kinds of penalties that fell on other criminals. I also think of his work on behalf of a more equitable distribution of funding for HIV-AIDS patients. Just as Senator Sessions strove to represent the interests of all Alabamians, I think Attorney General Sessions will strive to uphold the rights of all  Third, like the sword, Senator Sessions believes in swift and strong enforcement. Perhaps the best argument for his candidacy is the extensive list of endorsements he has received: the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the list goes on. I would think such widespread support among the people he would oversee would make a deep impression on any Senator's mind. If the people who actually enforce the law believe in his leadership, then so do  So I am sorry to see him say goodbye to this august body, but I am confident he will serve the American people well. He is the right man for the job. I urge all Senators to vote for his confirmation.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

12246,topic-id,1160,"Mr.President, today I am joining my colleagues on the floor with a bit of confusion, a bit of disappointment, and, frankly, a lot of questions. I am referring to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as the next Supreme Court  As a Senator, one of the most consequential votes I will cast is a vote to confirm a U.Supreme Court nominee. It is a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest  I recently spoke with some students back in Montana, some FFA students. The average age 17, 18 years old. God willing, Neil Gorsuch may serve on the Court for 30 or more years. These FFA students' children and perhaps even grandchildren will be part of Neil Gorsuch's time on the Court, given that he likely will serve for three decades or more.  As it stands today, the Senate is on the precipice of confirming Neil Gorsuch to be our next U.Supreme Court Associate However, as the news has been reporting, as our Twitter feeds are overflowing with information, it looks as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are caving to the pressures of the far left, and they are set to unleash an unprecedented filibuster.  I have met with Judge I watched his confirmation hearings. What I have seen and what most Americans agree--Judge Neil Gorsuch has been incredibly transparent, he has been accessible, and he is the right man for the position. He is mainstream. He is a westerner. He is committed to judicial independence. He has a brilliant legal mind--that is without dispute. He is exceptionally qualified. In fact, the American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Gorsuch as ``well qualified.'' That is its highest rating.  He has met with nearly 80 Prior to his hearing, he provided the Judiciary Committee over 70 pages of written answers about his personal record. He provided 75,000-plus pages of documents, including speeches, case briefs, opinions, and written works going as far back as his college days. The White House archives produced over 180,000 pages of email and paper records related to Judge Gorsuch's time at the Department of  Judge Gorsuch sat for three rounds of questioning, totaling nearly 20 hours, in committee. As the American people watched Judge Gorsuch before that committee, they saw an exceptionally qualified nominee for the highest Court in the land, someone who was bright, who was kind. I would argue that Judge Gorsuch's mind, his intellectual capacity, is only exceeded by his heart. This is a kind and independent jurist.  When he came before the Judiciary Committee, this was the longest hearing of any 21st-century nominee. He answered nearly 1,200 questions during his hearing, which is nearly twice as many questions posed to Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, or He was given 299 questions for the record by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee--the most in recent history of any Supreme Court nominee. Judge Gorsuch did all of this with the utmost integrity and with transparency and humility. Yet here we are, with Democrats engaged in unprecedented obstruction, refusing to give Neil Gorsuch an up-or-down vote.  The Senate has only ever employed a cloture motion for a Supreme Court nominee four times in modern history. We voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006. We did the same in 1968, 1971, and 1986. In 1991, Clarence Thomas was confirmed on a 52-to-48 vote, and in 2006, Samuel Alito was confirmed on a 58-to-42 vote. In fact, when President Obama was in the White House, Republicans did not filibuster a nominee. This body confirmed Sonya Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-to-31 and confirmed Justice Kagan by a rollcall vote of 63-to-37 in 2010. We did not filibuster.  Let me remind folks that cloture is in place to stop debate, not to stop a vote. Cloture was put in place to speed the Senate up, end debate, and move to a vote, not to stop a vote. It was never intended to be a stall tactic or something to obstruct this body.  This bears repeating. Cloture was put in place to speed up the process, to prevent obstruction.  This Chamber has never had a partisan filibuster to a Supreme Court nominee. Let me say that again. This Chamber has never had a partisan filibuster to a Supreme Court nominee.[[Page S2189]]  So here we are today, with no other option but to invoke this so-called nuclear option to put an eminently qualified individual on the U.Supreme Judge Gorsuch is the definition of a mainstream judge. In more than 2,700 cases in which he has participated in the Tenth Circuit, 97 percent of them have been decided unanimously; in fact, he was in the majority 99 percent of the time. Yet Senate Democrats would rather play politics and place the demands of extreme liberal interests over ensuring regular order.  Let's talk about what we are and what we are not doing. We are in the Senate, a Chamber I am honored to serve in, representing more than 1 million We operate on a set of Parliamentary criteria based on things that have happened before. Therefore, we are going to establish a new precedent; we aren't changing the rules. This isn't happening for the first time. Let us remember that in November of 2013, Senate majority leader Harry Reid established a new precedent of how many votes are necessary on executive branch nominees, with the exclusion of Supreme Court picks.  What is even more shocking to me is that over the past few weeks, through the hearing process, through the debate and discussions about Judge Gorsuch on the floor, and with support from across my State of Montana--let me just name some of those organizations and people in support of Judge Gorsuch: the Montana Chamber of Commerce; four of Montana's Tribes--the CSKT, the Crow Tribe, Fort Belknap and Fort Peck; the Montana Farm Bureau, Judge Russell Fagg of the 13th judicial district, Judge Jeffrey Langton of the 21st judicial district, Judge John Larson of the 4th judicial district, State senator Nels Swandal, retired judge of the 6th Judicial District; the Montana NRA members; the Montana Grain Growers Association and the Montana Wool Growers Association; the Montana Stockgrowers Association; our attorney general in Montana, our auditor in Montana, our speaker of the Montana This is a very mainstream group of Montanans, leaders back home who are in support of Judge Yet my colleagues are rejecting the will of the American people, rejecting the will of Montanans, filibustering this nomination, and not even allowing for an up-or-down vote.

12236,topic-id,1157,"Madam President, there is a poem that I recall, and it goes like this:     When I was going up the stair,     I met a man who wasn't there.     He wasn't there again today.     I wish that man would go away.  I thought about that poem when I listened to the majority leader's speech about how cooperative he has been when it comes to Supreme Court nominations. The name he forgot to mention was Merrick Garland--Merrick Garland, who was nominated by President Obama to fill the vacancy of Justice Antonin Scalia; Merrick Garland, the only Presidential nominee to the Supreme Court in the history of the U.Senate to be denied a hearing and a vote; Merrick Garland, about whom Senator McConnell said: I will not only refuse to give him a hearing and a vote, I refuse to even see him; Merrick Garland, who was found unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association; Merrick Garland, the person who received bipartisan support for appointment to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land.  So when the majority leader comes to the floor to talk about how cooperative he has been with previous Presidents when it comes to Supreme Court nominees, he conveniently omits the most obvious reason for our problems this week: the unilateral decision by the majority leader to preclude any vote on Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy of Justice  I know Judge I have met with him several times. He is a balanced, moderate, experienced jurist who should be on the U.Supreme We should not be entertaining Neil Gorsuch this week; we ought to be celebrating the first anniversary of Merrick Garland's service on the U.Supreme The reason we are not is that Senator McConnell and the Senate Republicans refused us that opportunity. They said: No, you cannot vote on that.  Remember their logic? The logic was: Wait a minute. This is the last year of President Obama's Why should he be able to fill a vacancy on the U.Supreme Court when we have an election coming soon?  That is an interesting argument. There are two things I am troubled with.  I do believe President Obama was elected for 4 years in his second term, not for 3, which meant he had authority in the fourth year, as he did in the third year.  Secondly, the Republican argument ignores history. It ignores the obvious history when we had a situation with President Ronald Reagan, in his last year in office, with regard to a vacancy on the U.Supreme There were Democrats in charge of the Senate and Democrats in charge of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and President Ronald Reagan, a lameduck President in his last year, nominated Anthony Kennedy to serve on the He sent the name to the Democratic Senate, and there was a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and a vote that sent him to the  You never hear that story from Senator It is because it does not fit into his playbook as to why he would wait for a year and refuse to give Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. The reasoning is obvious: Clearly he was banking on the possibility that the electorate would choose a Republican President--and that is what happened--so that a Republican President--in this case, Donald Trump--could fill the vacancy, not Barack  So when I hear the speeches on the floor by Senator McConnell about his bipartisan cooperation, he leaves out an important chapter--the last chapter, the one that brought us to this moment in the  I look at the situation before us today, and it is a sad situation for the Senate--sad in that we have reached the point in which a Supreme Court nomination has become so political, more so than at any time in history.  Where did the name ``Neil Gorsuch'' come from for the Supreme Court? It came from a list that was prepared by two organizations: the Federalist Society and the Heritage These are both Republican advocacy groups who represent special interests and are funded by special interests. They came up with the names and gave them to Presidential candidate Donald It was a list of 21 names. He issued them twice--in March and in September of the last campaign year--and Neil Gorsuch's name was on the list.  The Federalist Society was created in 1982. Nominally, it is an organization that is committed to originalism.[[Page S2181]]In other words, it looks to the clear meaning of the Constitution, what the Founding Fathers meant. They say that over and over again: Just look to the Constitution and read it, and then we will know what we should do. That was in a speech that was given by Edwin Meese, the then-Attorney General in 1985, who explained the Federalist Society's credo.  On its face, it sounds at least arguably defensible that there would be an organization that is so committed to the Constitution that it wants Supreme Court nominees who will follow it as literally as possible. Yet, as Justice William Brennan on the Supreme Court said, if they think they can find in those musty volumes from back in the 18th century all of the answers to all of the questions on the issues we face today--here is what he called it--that is arrogance posing as humility.  Yet that is what they said the Federalist Society was all about. If that were all the Federalist Society were about, then I guess one could argue that they ought to have their day in court, their day in choosing someone for the Supreme Court, but it is more than that. When you look at those who finance the Federalist Society--and it is a short list because they refuse to disclose all their donors--you see the classic names of Republican support: the Koch brothers, the Mercer family, the Richard Mellon Scaife family foundation, the ones who pop up over and over again. Why would these organizations be so determined to pick the next nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court? It is because there is so much at stake.  In a Judiciary Committee hearing, my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse went through the box score when it came to the Supreme Court and how they ruled when given a choice between special interests and corporate elites versus average workers and consumers and families. As Senator Whitehouse pointed out graphically, in detail, overwhelmingly, this Court has ruled for the special interests. Sixty-nine percent of the Roberts' Court's rulings are in favor of the U.Chamber of Commerce's position on issues, according to one study.  Why would a special interest organization like the Federalist Society care? It wants to keep a good thing going, from its point of view. That is why this is a different Supreme Court nominee.

Not quite 3 weeks since President Trump was sworn in as President of the United This evening at about 7 p.m., we will vote on his nominee for Attorney So in the first 20 days of his administration, he will have his Attorney  What the Senator from Texas failed to relate was the experience we went through not that long ago when President Obama wanted to fill the vacancy of the Attorney General's office with Loretta Lynch, a woman who had served as prosecutor, U.attorney, lifelong professional in the Department of Justice, who went through the regular hearing process in the Judiciary Committee, was reported from the committee, and she was sent more than 20 additional questions by Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama--more questions which of course, she dutifully answered, as she was required to do. Then she was reported to the calendar, where she sat for 2 months. A 2-month vacancy in the Attorney General's office. Why? Was there something substantively wrong or controversial about Loretta Lynch? If there happened to be, I never heard it.  Where then was that argument about national security and leaving the Attorney General nomination in limbo when it was President Obama seeking to fill that spot? Well, we didn't hear it at all. In fact, the Senator from Texas said: Oh, it was related to another bill and whether that bill was going to be called; it was actually Senator Reid who was holding it up.  From where I was sitting--and I came to the floor at one point and said: What are we waiting for? This lady is eminently qualified. She has been reported by the committee. She has answered all the questions. She languishes on the calendar.  She wasn't alone in this experience, incidentally. The Executive Calendar, as the Obama Presidency ended, was filled with nominees who were held for[[Page S924]]no obvious reason by the They had been reported from the committees. They were ready to fill judicial vacancies across the United States and other posts. And the official position of the Republican Senators happened to be: We are not going to ever let people vote on them because we are hoping and praying we will get a Republican President who can fill those same vacancies with people of our political persuasion. That was the reality.  That was the same reality that left Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, languishing for almost 1 year. The Republicans and the leaders in the Senate would not give him a hearing or a vote. And Senator McConnell came to the floor and said: I won't even meet with him.  So when I hear these protests now from the Republican side of how we are not moving quickly enough on these nominations, we are. And I think we are moving in the appropriate way. We are asking hard questions.  And I don't subscribe to the position of the Senator from Texas, who preceded me here, when it comes to the Voting Rights I listened as Senator Sessions of Alabama said that he believed the Shelby County v. Holder decision was a victory for the South when it ended preclearance of legislation that could have a direct impact on the voting rights of individuals. And I do recall what happened when the Federal court took a specific look at North Carolina's legislation statutes as it related to voting and said the North Carolina legislature had ``with surgical precision'' found ways to exclude African Americans from voting--not 20 years ago but just a few months ago, before this last election.  This is a critical issue, and it is interesting to me that last night the dustup on the floor involving the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Warren, was about the same issue, the Voting Rights  In a letter sent by Coretta Scott King to Strom Thurmond--then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee--when Senator Sessions, before he was Senator, was being considered for Federal judgeship--this is what Coretta Scott King said in the letter. I am not going to read the personal and controversial sections that have been pointed out before, but it is critical to what her message happened to be. She said to Strom Thurmond in a letter about Senator Sessions moving to the Federal bench:       Free exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to      American democracy that we cannot tolerate any form of      infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been      disenfranchised in our Nation's history, none has struggled      longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than      black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box      denied so persistently and intently.  It was a critical issue over 30 years ago when Mr.Sessions was then being considered for a Federal judgeship. It is a critical issue to this day because of two things: a decision by the Supreme Court, which basically took away one of the major powers of the Voting Rights Act, and, secondly, a coordinated effort by Republicans across the United States to suppress the vote of minorities and particularly African  I point directly to that North Carolina decision for what I just said. What they have tried to do is to systematically reduce the likelihood that poor people and minorities will vote. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights, I held public hearings in Ohio and Those hearings were held in those States because they had proposed new restrictions on voters.  So, both in Cleveland and in Florida, I brought the election officials--Democrats and Republicans--before my subcommittee, put them under oath and asked: What was the incidence of widespread voter fraud in the elections in your State which led you to make it more difficult and challenging for the people of your State to vote?  The answer was: There were none. There were no examples of widespread fraud. There were only a handful of prosecutions for voter fraud. That told the story. This didn't have anything to do with voter fraud. This had to do with discouraging turnout in areas that were more friendly to Democratic candidates, period. So when we make a big issue of the position of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions on the Voting Rights Act, it is with good cause.  It is historically an issue which has haunted the United States since the Civil War, when excuses after excuses were made for African Americans seeking the right to vote, and people were denied the right to vote with poll taxes and literacy tests and ridiculous standards to this very day, when the Republican Party strategy is to diminish the African-American vote by voter suppression.  Is it important that we know the position of Senator Jeff Sessions on the Voting Rights Act? To me, it is one of the most important questions to be asked. The fact that it evoked controversy on the Senate floor with Senator Warren last night is an indication of how seriously we take it. Yes, we have added a few more hours to the debate. I disagree with the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Texas who say: You know how it is going to end; why are you wasting our time?  I don't think it is a waste of time to have a fulsome debate in the Senate on something as fundamental as protecting the right of every American citizen to vote.  I yield the floor.

12314,topic-id,497,"Through the Chair, I will respond to the Senator from Here is the difference. Eight years ago, when Barrack Obama was elected President and was to be sworn in on January 20, he brought together his team to serve in his Cabinet and said to them: The first thing you need to do is to follow the law. You need to file all the papers required of you by the ethics standards of the United States  So, I am told that on January 8, almost 2 weeks before he was sworn in, their paperwork was on file. So they had complied with the law and they were awaiting their opportunity for a hearing. Contrast that with the current situation. There are still proposed Cabinet members by President Trump who have not filed their required ethics disclosures.  Why is it important? Because we believe that though we can't reach in and require the President to file his income tax returns, which he has steadfastly refused to do, we know what the standards are when it comes to many of those departments.  The standards are very demanding. There has to be a disclosure and there has to be a process of divestment. If I am about to become the head of an agency and my personal wealth includes holdings that have a direct impact on that agency, I am required by law to divest myself of those holdings. The more complicated my portfolio and net worth might be, the more challenging this is.  Penny Pritzker, a very wealthy individual from Chicago, was chosen by President Obama to be the Secretary of It took her 6 months, I say to the Senator from Montana, to fully comply with the law so she could go through the hearing--6 months. Now we hear complaints from the Republicans: Well, why aren't the Trump nominees going through more quickly? Why aren't our billionaires put on the fast-track?  I am sorry, but Trump billionaires are subject to the same rules as all billionaires. They have to file the necessary documents. I might add, you can go back a little further in history and find disqualifications for Cabinet positions. Oh, you hired someone in your[[Page S925]]household to work for you and you did not pay their Social Security, their FICA? Sorry, you are disqualified from being in a  Now we have Trump nominees where that is happening--not with frequency, but it is happening--and it doesn't seem to be even close to a disqualification. So it clearly is a double standard. I would say to the Senator from Montana, the fact that the Obama nominees moved through as quickly as they did showed they took the law seriously, they made the disclosures they were required to make, and in virtually every case had unique qualifications for the job.  To put Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education next to Arne Duncan, who headed up the Chicago Public School System as Secretary of Education, is to show that contrast.

12399,topic-id,839,"Mr.President, I just want to comment very briefly on the comments of the Republican leader.  It was interesting when he said the courtesies that were extended to President Clinton and President Obama when it came to Supreme Court nominees; he left out 1 year--last year.  Last year, when there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Antonin Scalia passed away and President Obama sent the nomination of Merrick Garland to the floor of the Senate, it was refused by the Republican leader to even give him a hearing, let alone a vote. So there was an omission in his call for courtesy when it comes to Nominee Gorsuch, a very grievous omission from the point of American history.  For the first time in the history of the U.Senate--for the first time--Republican leaders in the Senate refused to give a hearing and a vote to a Supreme Court nominee sent by President Many of us came to this floor pleading that we follow tradition and the I am going to stand by that. Even though I think Merrick Garland was treated poorly by the Republican majority, I believe that Neil Gorsuch is entitled to a hearing and a vote. I made that argument before; I will make it again.                       Republican Healthcare Bill  Mr.President, the second point I want to make, and very briefly, is that we now have seen the Affordable Care Act repeal that has been brought forward by the Republicans in the We still do not know its fiscal impact. The Congressional Budget Office, which traditionally scores legislation, tells us the impact it will have both on the deficit as well as on the American economy. In this case, we believe we will learn as early as next week what that impact will be. There are several things we know for certain. The Republican approach to changing the Affordable Care Act is going to reduce health insurance coverage in America, and it is going to raise the cost.  The cost, incidentally, will be especially hurtful to those over the age of 55. If you are a senior citizen or over the age of 55, this Republican bill says that your health insurance premiums can be substantially increased. There is a limit in the current law that you can't have a disparity of more than 3 to 1 in premiums between people of different age groups. That is changed by the Republican bill to say that older people can be charged up to five times[[Page S1705]]the premiums that are being paid by those in younger groups. That is substantial.  Secondly, it is painful and hurtful to Don't take my word for it; the American Association of Retired Persons has come out against the Republican healthcare plan, saying that it is going to reduce the number of years of solvency for the Medicare trust fund. That is not a positive thing; it is a negative thing for the tens of millions of Americans who count on  We also know that when it comes to this bill, there are provisions in here which are inconsistent with our goal to increase coverage across My Republican Governor in Illinois, who has been very careful to be critical of Republicans in Washington, came out this week and said that the elimination of Medicaid coverage and reduction in Medicaid coverage would create a budget hardship in our  I might add that it will be a hardship on the thousands of people in Illinois who rely on Medicaid to provide for their medical expenses. That includes not only the children and mothers in lower income groups but, substantially, seniors who are in nursing homes who have no place to turn. They are living on Social Security, Medicare, and That is how they survive. Reducing the Medicaid coverage is a danger to them when it comes to continuing on in a safe and healthy environment.  In addition to that, we know that Medicaid for many low-income Illinoisans and low-income Americans is the only health insurance they have. Many who work hard every day don't make enough money to buy health insurance, and their employer doesn't provide it. Medicaid came to their rescue under the Affordable Care Act, and it is going to be severely restricted. That is why my Republican Governor has come out against this Republican healthcare bill, and many others feel the same.  When we take a look at this bill when it comes over here--first, I plead with my colleagues, don't rush it through. Let's take the time to look at it carefully. It will affect the healthcare of millions of Second, let's hold to the standard that whatever changes we make will provide more healthcare protection in America and make a serious effort at reducing cost.

12410,topic-id,649,"Mr.President, today I come to the floor in opposition to the resolution to repeal regulations that help States and districts implement important provisions of the Every Student Succeeds  In the last Congress, Members of Congress did what seems nearly unimaginable today. We passed a bipartisan bill, the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, to fix No Child Left After 14 years, Democrats and Republicans in both Chambers came together on compromise legislation to reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). It gave States and districts flexibility to develop their own plans for holding schools accountable and encouraging improvements. At the same time, it included important Federal guardrails--including through regulatory authority--to fulfill the civil rights legacy of the original ESEA, ensuring that all students have equal access to high-quality public education.  Today, we should be focusing on the implementation of ESSA and providing critical resources to students, teachers, and schools. But, instead, we are on the Senate floor debating a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that would gut the regulations that help maintain the important balance that ESSA strikes between local control and making sure that States are held accountable for educating our students.  After listening to teachers, parents, principals, and superintendents, the Obama Administration issued the final accountability regulation last Among other things, this regulation provides important information to help States draft their State plans and develop accountability systems to determine whether children are actually learning. It gives more flexibility to States to develop academic standards, to measure student achievement, and to determine intervention strategies when subgroups of students are consistently underperforming. It also lays out how States should comply with important provisions of the law, including identifying low-performing schools for improvement.  Eliminating this regulation would roll back the Federal role in education that has been in place for more than 50 years. In 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, it created an extraordinary opportunity for our Nation to make an even deeper commitment to civil rights. It ensured that all children, regardless of their ZIP Code, background, disability, or family wealth, would have a right to a quality education. Repealing this regulation would overturn 52 years of progress. We should be committing ourselves to advancing equity in education, but instead Republicans are using a political tool--the Congressional Review Act--to remove important Federal protections for students. I believe it is a betrayal of the bipartisan framework that underpins  Striking this rule could also send States into chaos. Many States, including my home State of Illinois, have prepared their State plans to align with this regulation. Without the guidance and clarity that this regulation provides, states will not have the support they need to successfully implement It could ultimately lead to greater liability for States and districts that are responsible for complying with the law but are left to interpret how to implement the law for themselves. If this partisan CRA effort is successful, the Education Department will not be able to promulgate new rules related to these issues. Instead of policy that is subject to the public scrutiny and review of the formal Federal rulemaking process, repealing this rule gives incredible latitude to an administration that wants to dismantle public education.  When I voted for ESSA, it was with the understanding that the law allowed the Secretary of Education to promulgate rules to implement the bill's accountability provisions. Gutting these regulations swings the pendulum way too far in the direction of local control. Giving States more control with a blank check from the Federal Government is not responsible Federal policy. We should maintain critical Federal guardrails to hold States accountable for educating our children. We should uphold our vital role in protecting the civil rights of all children. Anything less says to our children that they don't matter. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this resolution.

Health care is highly complex, highly specialized, and it has a significant impact on our Our Federal Government's involvement in health care has changed dramatically over the last few decades, and that change has accelerated in the last few years. Health care makes up one-sixth of our economy, and the Department of Health and Human Services has a tremendous impact on all parts of all sectors of health care. Who better than a doctor should head an organization that covers the wide variety of major health care programs?  Let me mention just a few that a doctor should be in charge of. One would be Medicare, another is And then there is our vast biomedical research functions at the National Institutes of Health, usually referred to as Then there is our domestic and international public health work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC; the review of innovative and lifesaving drugs and devices at the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA; or how about our preparedness in the development of medical countermeasures at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA; and many other programs impacting the Nation's health that also provide an alphabet of initials.  Who better to understand the most important side of health care, the patient, than one who is, at the end of the day, the person that takes care of the patient? The patient is the biggest factor in all health policies. These policies are too often put together here in Hundreds of bureaucrats sit in offices, deciding what patients ought to have done to them. Sitting here in offices without being doctors, without having treated patients, I will be glad to have someone in charge there who, instead, considers what the patient wants done.  In the Senate HELP Committee hearing with Price, he spoke about his[[Page S935]]view on the importance of the patient in health care. He reiterated that again before the Finance Committee when he said: ``[It is] imperative that we have a system that's accessible for every single American, that's affordable for every single American, that incentivizes and provides the highest quality health care that the world knows and provides choices to patients so they are the ones selecting who is treating them, when, where, and the like.''  Tom Price is an ideal candidate for this role. Not only does he know the health care system as a physician, he knows it as a policymaker who has been a thought leader in health care here in His resume is well rounded. He has practiced and taught medicine, he was a business owner, and he served as a legislator.  Let me repeat. He has not only practiced medicine, he has taught medicine, and he has been a business owner of a large business that dealt with health care and he served as a legislator.  His confirmation will also mark the first time since the George H.Bush administration that a physician has led this agency. Our health care system is in a significant time of transformation. Well before ObamaCare, there was a need to make changes that would give people more options in health insurance and to find a way to contain costs.  We have even more work to do now as patients find themselves with fewer choices and higher costs. The new Secretary's role will be a difficult one. In the last year, our health insurance markets have teetered into unstable ground, especially in the individual market. Even with absolutely no change in the law, more and more people will lose access to health insurance coverage.  It has been suggested that the Republicans should just let the current system keep going for another year or so until the Democrats would be begging us to make changes, but we are not going to do that. We are not going to have those people go through that kind of suffering, even though there is a risk to it. We are not going to sit and wait for the system to crash. We will be working in Congress to repeal ObamaCare and reform our health care system by putting the patient first.  It will be critical to have a partner in the administration to make changes and implement the law in a way that reflects the intent of Congress and provides for full, open, and transparent input from the public. I understand that some of my Democratic colleagues have decided that being a Republican is a disqualifying characteristic for any Cabinet It is all too easy to resort to vilification of our political opponents, but I will just point out the words of David Lloyd George, who is not a conservative, who said: ``A politician is a person with whose politics you don't agree; if you agree with him, he is a statesman.''  Tom Price's nomination is something that I believe would have been relatively noncontroversial, even a few years ago. I know that when I voted in favor of the confirmation of Sylvia Burwell as the Secretary of Health and Human Services for President Obama's Cabinet, I looked at her qualifications, not her politics.  If we look at Price with the same lens, I am hopeful we will see a bipartisan vote for this confirmation.

12145,topic-id,436,"I thank the gentleman from  Madam Speaker, back in 1987, then-President Ronald Reagan issued one of his most famous speeches--``tear down this wall''--as he addressed then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to insist that he open the barrier dividing East and West It was, perhaps, one of the most exciting times as we watched to see, finally, if the Cold War would end. It was a moment of hope and strength and character that propelled our country to a higher regard and standard of our identity throughout the global community.  Today, in stark contrast to that famous speech given by President Ronald Reagan, President Trump orders the construction of a $25 billion wall that divides communities, separates families, and perpetuates fear and hate. It sets a dangerous precedent and fails to elevate our country and confidence abroad the way it was back when President Reagan gave that famous speech. The economic ramifications will be devastating to the entire country, going as far north as New York City, because it is $25 billion or more that will be spent on building this wall that could otherwise go to other meritorious projects.  These executive actions also secure what I call insecure communities, not Secure Communities--a program that strains relationships between law enforcement and communities along the border and throughout that region of our country.  We live in a global society and are connected with countries and citizens from around the world. To build this wall not only separates the United States from our bordering country--our neighbor, Mexico, which is one of our biggest trading partners--but the wall itself sends a strong message to citizens around the world that they are not welcome here in The President's wall and his anti-immigrant agenda is a continuation of the[[Page H862]]irrational and hateful rhetoric we have witnessed from him before, and it stands contrary to who we are as Americans and to what we believe as a nation.  I am proud to introduce one of my first bills in Congress, called This is Our Land, which is legislation that will prohibit this divisive wall from being erected on public lands. This is a time when we should be investing in our infrastructure--in roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, housing--and also respecting our public lands. Building President Trump's wall would trample on our public lands and potentially put precious endangered species at risk and likely disrupt or destroy environmentally important ecosystems and habitats. It would also deplete precious resources from our cities. We should be building a wall around Trump to stop these irrational executive orders--instead of this ludicrous $25 billion wall between our closest ally.

12159,topic-id,179,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to recognize Equal Pay The year is 2017, and women, especially women of color, still earn significantly less than their male counterparts.  Pay inequality disproportionately impacts women of color. For example, White women earn 80 cents to every dollar that her White male counterpart makes, African-American women earn an average of 63 cents per every dollar, and Latina women on average earn 54 cents for every dollar.  This may seem like mere pennies on the dollar, but, over a lifetime, this translates to an estimated loss of almost $700,000 for a high school graduate and $1.2 million for a college graduate. $1.2 million--can you imagine what these earnings mean to working families of today? That is health insurance, retirement savings, and food on the table. Unequal pay for equal work just doesn't add up. It is morally and mathematically wrong.  Pay inequality is not only a women's issue, but a family issue. To my male colleagues, I ask: In 2017, do you not believe in strong women?

12444,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to put people before politics. As we speak, the Senate is moving to strip millions of families of their healthcare coverage and replace it with, well, nothing.  Now, I know that some of my colleagues ran on a platform of repealing the Affordable Care Act, and now they feel boxed in by politics. But let's be very clear about this. The political stakes of repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement are nothing compared to the terrible human cost.  I would like to share with my colleagues the experience of Suzie Clayton, my constituent from North Canaan, ``The ACA had a huge, positive impact on my life,'' Suzie wrote to me last week. Because Suzie is a breast cancer survivor, a preexisting condition, it was nearly impossible for her to get decent healthcare coverage before the  ``All that we had put away in retirement funds, nearly $70,000, had to be tapped in order to cover our health costs,'' she wrote. If it weren't for the coverage she gained through the Affordable Care Act, she and her husband would have lost everything they had worked for, quite likely, including their home.  Instead, with the ACA, her family is once again saving for retirement, completing some overdue home repairs, and getting their medical needs taken care of at an affordable price. All of that will go away if this House follows through on its political crusade to wipe away the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.  Mr.Speaker, there are millions of Suzie Claytons in this country, millions of people who will lose their homes, lose their savings, and some will even lose their lives if this Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.  In my home State of Connecticut alone, 180,000 people who have gained coverage since the ACA was implemented stand to lose their health care. That includes 43,000 children.  Think about that for a moment. If Congress repeals the ACA and doesn't replace it with anything, 43,000 children just in my State will lose their health coverage. When those children get sick, too many of their parents will be faced with a heart-wrenching choice: bankrupt the family to pay for their child's medical care or go without the health services their child needs to get better. All of us here who are parents know that that isn't really a choice.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues who are beating the drum for wholesale elimination of the Affordable Care Act: How can you, in good conscience, take away the health care from 43,000 children in my State just to score a political point? How can you throw our healthcare system into chaos just because you are in a political jam?  Let's work together. Let's work together to improve our healthcare system. Let's forge a sensible, bipartisan approach to lower healthcare costs and ensure access to quality care for everyone.  The politics of ObamaCare, no matter how fraught and divisive, should not, must not take priority over the well-being of the American people that we are here to serve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH241.txt,2114,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,10.0,February
12302,topic-id,3003,"Thank you, Mr.I rise in opposition to the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as our Nation's next Attorney  The U.Attorney General has a job like none other. Our Nation's top law enforcement officer doesn't enforce just the laws designed to protect national security and keep the public safe but also the laws designed to protect Americans' civil rights and civil liberties, the laws that guarantee each and every American access to the same opportunities and to participate fully in our democracy.  I know Senator He and I have served on the Judiciary Committee together since I joined the Senate back in 2009, and I have a good relationship with Senator I respect him as a colleague. But as anyone who has observed Senator Sessions or me in a Judiciary Committee hearing could probably tell you, he and I have very different views about many of the issues that he stands to influence as Attorney General, particularly matters of equal justice. So once the President announced his nomination and after Senator Sessions submitted his material to the committee, I reviewed his background carefully, and I paid special attention to how he described his work on civil rights. I noticed some discrepancies in the way he described his involvement in civil rights cases filed during his time as U.attorney. Those discrepancies stood out to me, and they didn't just stand out because civil rights is an issue I care about personally or because it is an issue I know Senator Sessions and I have disagreed about in the past; the discrepancies caught my attention because the information seemed to misrepresent the nominee's record, and that is something Senator Sessions himself promised not to do.  You see, back in 2009 when Senator Sessions became the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, he was interviewed about how he would approach the committee's work in general and nominations in specific. Senator Specter, who was serving as the ranking Republican at the time, had just changed his party affiliation to join the Democrats, and so the gavel passed to Senator Some people, particularly on my side of the aisle, were anxious about how Senator Sessions would lead the committee's Republicans given his more conservative views, but during that interview with the National Review, Senator Sessions indicated that Democrats should expect him to be an honest broker, to be fair to the Democratic nominee.  Senator Sessions cited his experience before the Judiciary Committee back in 1986 when President Reagan nominated him to serve on the Federal bench. The committee rejected his nomination then, and Senator Sessions felt that in doing so, the committee had distorted his record. He said: ``What I learned in that process is that we're not going to misrepresent any nominee's record, and we're not going to lie about it.''  Senator Sessions said, as ranking member, that nominees before the committee would be ``entitled to explain the charges against them. That doesn't mean I'll accept their explanation or agree with it.''  In my view, that seemed like a fair way to conduct the committee's business. When I set about the task of reviewing Senator Sessions' record and the materials that he provided to the committee, I expected that those materials would not misrepresent his record. I took him at his word.  So when I noticed discrepancies regarding the nominee's record, I gave Senator Sessions an opportunity to explain them. I asked him about his claim to have filed 20 or 30 desegregation cases, a claim he made in that same 2009 National Review interview. In response, in the committee hearing Senator Sessions said: ``The records do not show that there were 20 or 30 actually filed cases.'' Of the claim, he said: ``The record does not justify it.''  I then moved on to question him about four cases he had listed on his committee questionnaire, which asked him to list the ``10 most significant litigated matters [he] personally handled.'' Among those 10 cases were three voting rights cases and a desegregation case.  I know Senator Sessions, and I know his record on voting rights. He is no champion of voting rights. He has called the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive'' and complained about States with a history of discrimination being subject to preclearance. But here his questionnaire seemed to tout his personal involvement in three voting rights cases and one desegregation case. It seemed to me that, given his previous experience before this committee and given the concern the civil rights community had expressed about his nomination, perhaps the transition team or others managing Senator Sessions' nomination had attempted to revise some of his history and recast him as a civil rights champion.  I questioned Senator Sessions about the questionnaire's claim of personally handling those four civil rights cases. I mentioned that the Department of Justice attorneys who had worked on three of those four cases wrote an op-ed stating that Senator Sessions had no substantive involvement in those cases. Two of those attorneys also submitted testimony to that effect, explaining that Senator Sessions had no personal involvement in some of the cases that he had listed among the top 10 matters that he had personally listed.  I asked Senator Sessions about this. In my view, he deserved an opportunity to explain himself. I asked him whether these attorneys had distorted his record by stating that with regard to three of those four cases: ``We can state categorically that Sessions had no substantive involvement in any of them.''  Senator Sessions said: Yes, he believed they were distorting his record. He said that he had supported the attorneys, and he had signed the complaints they had brought.  Senator Sessions' reply mirrored answers he provided in a supplement to his initial questionnaire. In that supplement, which he filed 2 weeks after his initial questionnaire, the nominee clarified that his role was to ``provide support for'' DOJ attorneys. He said he ``provided assistance and guidance'' and ``cooperated'' with DOJ lawyers--not quite ``personally handled,'' if you ask me. I suspect that is why he felt the need to file the supplement.  It is also worth noting that all four of the civil rights cases at issue--the ones at issue here--had either concluded or were still active back when Senator Sessions first appeared before the Judiciary Committee in 1986. But 30 years ago, when he submitted his questionnaire, which also asked him to list the ``ten most significant litigated matters which [he] personally handled,'' Senator Sessions did not list a single one of these four cases--not a single one. I wonder what changed between 1986 and now that caused these four civil rights cases to take on new significance for the nominee. Look, the fact of the matter is that Senator Sessions simply did not personally handle the civil rights cases that his questionnaire indicates he personally handled. His questionnaire overstates his involvement in these cases and the supplement he filed makes that perfectly clear. As I said, in the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions would not have tolerated that kind of misrepresentation, and no Member of this body should either. Senator Sessions said in 2009:       We're are not going to misrepresent any nominee's record. .      . . They'll be entitled to[[Page S919]]     explain the charges against them. That doesn't mean I'll      accept their explanation or agree with it.  And neither do  The Senate has an important job to do. It requires that each and every one of us understand the nominee's record accurately. The duties and responsibilities of our Nation's top law enforcement officer demand that the President nominate an individual who puts country before party and who is willing to pursue justice for the most vulnerable among us. But I do not have confidence that a nominee whose submissions to the Judiciary Committee inflate and exaggerate his handling of the critical issues--issues such as protecting the right to vote--is, frankly, capable of pursuing equal justice under the law.  I questioned Senator Sessions about voting rights during his hearing. I asked him about an extraordinary claim by the then President-elect. In late November, President-Elect Trump tweeted: ``In addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.'' Let me repeat that: ``the millions of people who voted illegally.''  Let's be clear. President Trump lost the popular vote by 2.86 million votes--the popular vote for the He is the President of the United States, but he lost the popular vote by 2.86 million votes. When he says, ``I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,'' he is saying that at least 2.86 million people voted illegally.  That is a pretty extraordinary charge. During Senator Sessions' hearing, I asked, do you agree with the President-elect that millions of fraudulent votes had been cast?  He responded: ``I don't know what the President-elect meant or was thinking when he made that comment, or what facts he may have had to justify his statement.''  Senator Sessions didn't say whether he agreed. I asked him whether he had talked to the President-elect about that issue. Senator Sessions said: ``I have not talked to him about that in any depth.''  Under the Attorney General's leadership and direction, the Department of Justice is tasked with protecting the right to vote and with prosecuting fraud. It seems unusual to me that the President-elect would make such an outrageous claim, backed with no evidence, asserting that a fraud of truly epic proportion had occurred and that he wouldn't bother to discuss it with the man nominated to lead the Justice Department nor that the man tasked to head the Justice Department wouldn't ask him about it and ask what his evidence was so that when he became Attorney General, he could prosecute this voter fraud.  But, in my questioning, none of this seemed to bother Senator I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, because another thing that didn't seem to bother Senator Sessions was the speed with which States previously covered by the Voting Rights Act, covered by preclearance, moved to restrict voting rights after the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision. He and I discussed this at his hearing. I pointed out that after Shelby County, States moved quickly to enact new restrictions, but he didn't seem concerned.  We discussed North Carolina, which enacted restrictions that the Fourth Circuit eventually described as targeting African Americans with ``almost surgical precision''--targeting African Americans with almost surgical precision to make it harder for them to vote, to suppress their vote, which suppressed African-American votes in the 2014 election. So this had happened.  But it didn't seem to bother Senator All he said was ``every election needs to be managed closely and we need to ensure that there is integrity in it, and I do believe we regularly have fraudulent activities occur during election cycles.''  Now, let's be clear. Claims of apocryphal voter fraud are used to justify voter suppression. Claims of bogus fraud are exactly what States cite when they enact laws designed to keep certain people from voting.  So understanding Senator Sessions' views on voting rights and understanding how he responded to the President-elect's outrageous claims of fraud--and is there anyone here in this body who doesn't believe that the President's claims are outrageous and, indeed, pernicious? Keeping Senator Sessions' views on voting rights in mind and understanding how he responded to the President's claims is important to helping us assess whether he is capable of filling one of the Attorney General's most important duties, protecting the right to vote.  That is how we all got here. We won elections. That is how the Presiding Officer won an election in Alaska, fair and square. This is so basic. The Fourth Circuit ruled that North Carolina had surgically targeted African Americans, and because of the Shelby decision, the Justice Department couldn't review that, couldn't do preclearance, couldn't prevent African Americans from having their votes suppressed. That should bother us.  That should bother every one of us. It really should. We are here. We had some arguments over the last evening. The ones having the arguments were all elected. Protecting the franchise is the most basic duty in a democracy. And whose job is that? That is the job of the Attorney  Think about how basic and fundamental this is. It is all the words that are said here on the floor, they are said by people who won elections. I won an election by 312 votes. Every vote is important. To suppress votes, to surgically target a race of people, how fundamentally wrong is that? It should make us shiver. It should, I would hope, clarify to my colleagues why there is so much fear in this country, when a man who is President of the United States says there are 3 million to 5 million votes fraudulently cast. I wonder how he got 3 million. Could it possibly have anything to do with the fact that he lost the popular vote by 2.86 million? How did he bring that figure out of the air?  What are the American people supposed to think when the President makes these laughable claims, faced with no facts whatsoever?  He told the story about a German golfer in line in Do my colleagues remember this? He heard this story thirdhand. This is his proof to the congressional leadership. I believe Senator Cornyn was actually there. I think he was part of the group who went there as the leadership of the The President said that part of his evidence was this story that this German golfer in line had three Hispanic people in front of him and three in back. The President then went into conjecture about what Latin American countries they could be from. Then he said that none of them were pulled out of the line; only the German golfer, the famous German golfer. He has won some PGA tournaments. He is a great golfer. He is not registered to vote in the United  The story was apocryphal. Doesn't this send a chill down the spine of every Member of this Senate who cares about the franchise?  Think about it. This is the fundamental building block of our democracy--the franchise.  Now, Senator Sessions said during his hearing that he believes we regularly have fraudulent activities during our election cycles. That might explain why he didn't talk with the President-elect in any depth about the now-President's claim that millions of fraudulent votes were cast. Perhaps Senator Sessions didn't find it alarming because he believes there is a kernel of truth in the claim. There is not. That claim has been fact-checked to death. Nearly 138 million votes were cast in the 2016 election. State officials found virtually no credible reports of fraud and no sign whatsoever of widespread fraud.  In 2014, a comprehensive study examined elections over 14 years, during which more than 1 billion ballots were cast, and they found just 31 incidents of in-person fraud, but that didn't stop President Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. He again claimed that he won the popular vote and continued to claim it and asked for an investigation.  This is so profoundly disturbing. I ask my colleagues, doesn't it bother you?  The President went on to tweet about this ``major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal, and even, those registered to vote who are dead, and then (and many for a long time).''[[Page S920]]  I know on my deathbed, which I hope is many, many years from now, surrounded by my family, my grandchildren, and hopefully my great-grandchildren, if they say: Grandpa, Great-grandpa, any last wishes, I would say: Yes, I want to, before I leave this world, ``slip my mortal coil,'' or whatever Shakespeare said; I want to make sure that I unregistered to vote because I was a U.Senator and I wouldn't want to commit voter fraud, so, please, somebody, call the county clerk. I am too weak to do that.  But I want to unregister because clearly anyone who doesn't unregister to vote before they die is committing some kind of fraud, and clearly anyone who is registered to vote in two States is committing fraud--people like Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, the Press Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary designee, the President's daughter Tiffany, and his son-in-law Jared We really should investigate them.  The President has said the administration would form a commission led by Vice President Pence to investigate this voter fraud.  This raises serious concerns, not the least of which is whether such an order or commission would serve as a pretext for nationwide voter suppression. Before my colleagues vote on Senator Sessions' nomination, we deserve to know whether the President intends for the Attorney General or the Justice Department to lead or participate in these investigations.  When the President of the United States lies about the existence of massive, widespread fraud, it is the job of the Attorney General to call him on it. It is the job of the Attorney General to call him on it. The Attorney General has an obligation to tell it like it is. Senator Sessions may have said it best himself. When Sally Yates was nominated to be the Deputy Attorney General, Senator Sessions questioned her during her confirmation hearing. He said: ``You have to watch out because people will be asking you to do things and you will need to say no.''  Do you think the Attorney General has a responsibility to say no to the President if he asks for something that is improper? A lot of people have defended the Lynch nomination, for example, by saying: Well, he will appoint somebody who is going to execute his views. Well, what is wrong with that? But if the views the President wants to execute are unlawful, should the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General say no?

We need an Attorney General who will defend our civil rights and human rights--with no exceptions. We need an Attorney General who will not be afraid to challenge the President if an order is illegal or unconstitutional.

Already, in just the first weeks of this new administration, President Trump has begun to test the strength and limits of our He has challenged the separation of powers. He has lashed out against the free press. He has singled out individual religions--and even individual judges.  Now, more than ever, we need an Attorney General whose commitment to defending our Constitution goes far beyond the commitment to any one particular President or political party. Would Senator Sessions challenge the President when he needs to be challenged?  During the Presidential campaign, when the tape was revealed of then-Candidate Trump bragging about groping a woman against her will, Senator Sessions said he thought it was a ``stretch'' to call it sexual assault. He said: ``I don't characterize that as sexual assault.''  We need an Attorney General who knows very clearly what sexual assault is, and who cares enough to prosecute it.

He vocally opposed the Matthew Shepard and James      Byrd, Hate Crimes Prevention Act when it was added as an      amendment to the 2008 Defense Authorization Act because it      added sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of      classes protected under federal hate crimes law. In addition,      Senator Sessions joined 21 other senators to vote against the      2012 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which      included new protections for immigrants and LGBTQ people.

12224,topic-id,523,"Mr.President, in 2006, I was successful in enacting much needed updates to the IRS whistleblower program. Up until that time, the program was entirely a voluntary award program. There was also no central office within the IRS for handling whistleblower claims. Given this, there was little incentive for whistleblowers to step forward potentially risking their careers.  My 2006 amendments sought to bolster the IRS whistleblower program by making a special program targeted at going after high-dollar tax cheats, such as corporations. It did this by making awards mandatory in cases where a whistleblower discloses tax fraud totaling $2 million or more. Moreover, the 2006 amendments established the Whistleblower Office within the IRS to formalize and manage the program.  The IRS whistleblower program has turned into one of the most effective programs in addressing tax evasion--leading to the recovery of more than $3 billion in taxes that otherwise would have been lost to fraud. I firmly believe the program has the potential to collect even greater sums going forward. However, for this to occur, the IRS is going to have to completely embrace the program and start to view whistleblowers as their allies.  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued a report on the program in 2015 that expressed concerns that long timelines and poor communication may be discouraging whistleblowers. This is exactly what I have been hearing from whistleblowers for years. Too often whistleblowers are waiting in the dark for years with no communication on where their claim is in the system.  While the IRS has made improvements in this area, I fear that without further improvements some whistleblowers may start to question whether stepping forward is worth their time and effort. My concern is exacerbated by the fact that under current law, IRS whistleblowers have no protections against employer retaliation for good-faith disclosures.  That is why I am pleased to be joined by Senator Wyden today in introducing legislation that seeks to address these issues. The IRS Whistleblower Improvements Act would increase communication between the IRS and whistleblowers, while protecting taxpayer privacy, and provide legal protections to whistleblowers from employers retaliating against them for disclosing tax abuses.  To increase communication, our bill would specifically allow the IRS to exchange information with whistleblowers where doing so would be helpful to an investigation. It would further require the IRS to provide status updates to whistleblowers at significant points in the review process and allows for further updates at the discretion of the It does this while ensuring the confidentiality of this information is maintained.  Moreover, to protect whistleblowers from employer retaliation, our bill extends antiretaliation provisions to IRS whistleblowers that are presently afforded to whistleblowers under other whistleblower laws, such as the False Claims Act and Sarbanes- Too often, whistleblowers are treated like skunks at a picnic. This is unfortunate, as often the only way to discover fraud and abuse is for a whistleblower to step forward. It is time we roll out the welcome mat for IRS whistleblowers. Our bill takes a good step in that direction.  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Wyden and me in supporting this commonsense legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgS2100.txt,457,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,29.0,April
12350,topic-id,849,"Mr.President, there has been a lot of discussion about Senator Sessions' nomination on this floor in the last 24 hours. Before we vote, I want to offer a couple of observations about the unfairness in some of the statements.  First, I was hoping to limit my remarks to all of the reasons why I believe Senator Sessions will make an outstanding Attorney General, but instead I feel very compelled to say a few words about some of the attacks that have been leveled against Senator Sessions here on the floor, where he has served the people of Alabama faithfully for 20 years.  A number of Senators have come to the floor to talk about Senator Sessions' hearing in 1986 when he was nominated to be a Federal judge. Now, it happens that I was in the Senate in 1986, at that time by 6 years. I was on the Judiciary Committee in 1986, by that time for 6 years, and I want you to know I saw what happened. I don't have time to go into all the details here, but I will tell you this: Jeff Sessions' hearing in 1986 was an absolute ambush. In fact, it was a planned ambush. He was unfairly attacked then and he is being unfairly attacked now. I will give just two examples.  First, in the last 24 hours, we have heard Senator Sessions attacked for a voting rights case that he pursued as U.attorney in We have heard a lot about that case. Of course, those who have raised the Perry County trial don't tell you Senator Sessions was actually asked to pursue that case by two African-American candidates who believed that ballots cast by African-American voters had been altered. The bottom line is that he was vindicating the voting rights of African-American voters whose voting rights had been compromised.  Second, we have heard Senator Sessions criticized for testimony in his 1986 Judiciary Committee hearing about the Voting Rights It has been said on this floor and it has been said repeatedly that Jeff Sessions called the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive,'' but those speaking in the last 24 hours don't know what he actually said. He did use the word ``intrusive,'' but then he said the Department of Justice had to do it ``because it would not have happened any other way.''  He said further: ``Federal intervention was essential in the South.'' He said it was an intrusive piece of legislation ``because it was a necessary piece of legislation, I support it.'' That is right. He said the Voting Rights Act ``was a necessary piece of legislation, I support it.'' That is what he said. But if you have been listening the last 24 hours--you wouldn't know any of that by listening to those who have come to the floor and talked all about that case in 1986.  Like I said, I was here way back then. I saw what happened to that man who is going to be our next Attorney General, who would go on to join the Senate for these 20-some years and become our colleague and our friend. So you can understand why it is very frustrating to me to listen to all of those attacks, and it is particularly frustrating to hear it from Members who were not even here in 1986.  With that, let me just say this in closing: Senator Sessions has served with us for 20 years. Every Member of this body knows him to be a man of integrity. Almost all of us have been on the other side of a policy debate with Senator Sessions at one time or another. I know I have. What we know from those debates is that whether Senator Sessions agrees with you or not on any policy question, he handles the debate fairly, he handles the debate respectfully, and he handles the debate honorably.  Senator Sessions answered our questions in the Judiciary Committee for 10 long hours. He gave us his word on the critical issues that should decide our vote on this nomination. Most of that was centered around the fact that he is a man devoted to the law, and he is devoted as the chief law enforcement officer of our country to enforce the law, even if he didn't vote for it and even if he disagreed with it.  We know from the questioning that Senator Sessions will be independent when he said when he has to say no to the President of the United States, he will say no to the President of the United We know Senator Sessions then, as I have said, will enforce the law faithfully, without regard to person, for all  Motivated by those principles, Senator Sessions will make a very fine Attorney General, and most people in this body know that--even those who are going to vote against him.  I am pleased to cast my vote in favor of his nomination, and of course I urge my colleagues to do the same thing.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue). The Senator from Alabama.[[Page S962]]    ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS873-2.txt,457,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,6.0,April
12411,topic-id,839,"Mr.President, the other body spent yesterday and well into the night to vote out bills that would repeal and reform I do not know exactly what is going to[[Page S1712]]happen in the other body on that issue, but I would like to add some thoughts on the issue of repeal and replace.  ObamaCare has been a case of overpromise and underdelivery. People were told that their premiums would go down by $2,500. They have actually gone up by an average of $3,500. They were also promised that if they liked their doctors, they would be able to keep their doctors. Millions of people have had to change doctors. Then they were told that they could keep their healthcare plans, and millions of people have had to change their healthcare plans. In fact, ObamaCare has been a case of overpromise and underdelivery. The reality is much different.  ObamaCare is hurting more people than it is helping. I have heard from many Iowans about the tremendous premium increases and, most importantly, all about high deductibles and high copays that make ObamaCare not worth its consideration.  One farmer said his health insurance premium went from $20,000 to $30,000 in one year. Another family said their ObamaCare premium increased 144 percent over 3 years. The 2017 premium for three people was over $24,000, and families who did manage to purchase ObamaCare insurance found that they could no longer afford to use it because of sky-high deductibles and copays. Another Iowan said that his policy for his family of three increased from $15,000 a year to $23,000 in 1 year, with, more importantly, the policy's value being less because the deductible for that plan is nearly $6,000.  It is quite obvious, as you think of these situations, that very few people can afford some of the prices or afford the deductibles that we hear about. So I think it is a very clear summation to say that ObamaCare is not working.  According to Avalere, one-third of the country will have only one insurance carrier that offers ObamaCare plans next year. Since that analysis by Avalere, another insurance company has pulled out of ObamaCare and has left some parts of the country without any insurance companies whatsoever for the folks to choose from. So many insurance companies have dropped out of ObamaCare that there are places in the country where people have a subsidy, but no insurance plans to buy. That is like having a bus ticket and there is no bus to take you anywhere.  Even those who were strong supporters of the healthcare law, like, as an example, the Democratic Governor of Minnesota, have said--or he said--the ACA ``is no longer affordable to many Americans.''  The problem with ObamaCare is it did nothing to address the underlying causes of the high cost of healthcare; that is, what it costs for a hospital or doctor to purchase and maintain medical equipment, to purchase medicines, to carry malpractice insurance, and things like that. Rather than address the actual cost of care, President Obama chose to bypass real healthcare reform for an unsustainable entitlement and, of course, bureaucratic mandates, which have priced people out of the healthcare insurance market, rather than provide them with affordable and quality coverage.  It is time, then, as the House was working throughout the night, to deliver more accessible, more affordable healthcare to even more ObamaCare has failed on both of these points, with, I believe, 29 million people still not having health insurance.  It is time to reduce the role of the Federal Government in the healthcare system because I think that expanded role is one of the very basic problems we have with It is time to spend less and get better quality care.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work across the aisle in a bipartisan way. They know the Affordable Care Act is not serving the purposes that it was intended to serve and is falling apart and, in a short period of time, it may collapse. I think the other side is trying to distract attention from the Affordable Care Act collapse, and they are doing it by using the usual scare tactics. It used to be those scare tactics were applied just to Medicare improvements, but now they are applied across the board of healthcare delivery in  It is time for the other party to step up instead of doubling down because it was their plan passed in March of 2010 that put us in this spiral we are in. It is time for statesmanship, not gamesmanship. It is time for the people who are responsible for ObamaCare to stop defending the un-Affordable Care Act and deliver Americans what was promised.  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues and, of course, our new President to deliver affordable healthcare to more  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander control 10 minutes of the remaining debate time on H.57.

12335,topic-id,1789,"Mr.President, my parents met when they were graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1960s when they were active in the civil rights movement. In fact, my sister and I joke that we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent their full time marching and shouting for this thing called justice.  I was part of only the second class to integrate Berkeley, CA, public schools almost two decades after the U.Supreme Court declared that separate was inherently unequal in the great case of Brown v. Board of Education--a case, I might add, that was supported by an amicus brief from the then U.Attorney  In fact, it was the lawyers in Brown v. Board of Education--Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, and Constance Baker Motley--who inspired me at a young age to become a lawyer.  Simply put, it is likely that had the U.Supreme Court not decided the[[Page S944]]way it did in Brown v. Board of Education, I would not be standing here as a Member of the U. So then, as a direct beneficiary of landmark rulings by the U.judicial system and the American judicial system, I am acutely aware of the lasting and profound impact our courts can have on the everyday lives of It is with a deep sense of respect and admiration for the role of our justice system that I rise to oppose the nomination of Senator Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United  The mission of the Department of Justice is clear: ``To enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats, foreign and domestic; to provide Federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.''  It is those words--``justice for all''--that best articulate the spirit behind our judicial system.  I am a career prosecutor. In fact, I started my work as a young deputy district attorney in the Alameda County District Attorney's That office was once led by U.Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Every time I filed a case, it would never read with the name of the victim versus the name of the defendant. It always read ``the people'' versus the defendant because in our democracy, in our great judicial system, we have rightly said a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us, especially because we know that harm is most often directed at some of the most vulnerable and voiceless among us. So we rightly have declared that as a civil society, we will not require them to fight alone. We will stand with them. Justice for all.  This point is what raises my question of whether this nominee can fulfill the role and responsibility of this job. Let's be clear. This is not a debate about a President's nominee. It is not simply a debate about a President's nominee. This is a debate about the fundamental ideals of our country--ideals that date back to the founding of our country and those great words we spoke in 1776: ``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.''  All men are created equal, with unalienable rights. In other words, President Lincoln was fulfilling the promise first made in the Declaration of Independence, a promise that made clear the basis for legal equality derives not through a right that is given but from natural rights--rights that have been endowed upon us by our Creator; rights that cannot and should not be taken away or given up.  So let us recognize that civil rights are not given through the enactment of a law or the publication of a court decision. Rather, our inherent civil rights are fulfilled when we guarantee them through the implementation and enforcement of the law.  Well-meaning people indeed can argue over the best means to ensure our fundamental rights, but it is crucial that we do not allow ourselves to be drawn into a suggestion that enforcing civil rights is favoring one group over another. Protecting civil rights is not about taking care of someone else. It is in our common interests. It is in each of our self-interests.  Liberty for each of us depends on liberty for all of us. It is just like the Department of Justice's mission, which articulates in those three words, ``justice for all.''  This is the Department's charge. It is its mission, and the next Attorney General of the United States must use his powers as a prosecutor to uphold it.  This brings me to the troubling and, frankly, unacceptable record of the nominee for this office. It is the U.Department of Justice that is charged with enforcing the rights of those trying to cast a ballot, but Senator Sessions cheered the Supreme Court's decision to gut the Voting Rights Act, used his power as a U.attorney to prosecute three African-American Civil Rights activists in Alabama, and then called the NAACP ``un-American.''  It is the U.Department of Justice that addresses systemic inequalities that we know, unfortunately, still exist in our criminal justice system and have led to mass incarceration--but Senator Sessions led the opposition to bipartisan sentencing reform.  It is the U.Department of Justice that investigates and prosecutes crimes motivated by hate based on race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation of its victim--but in the 1990s, when lawmakers worked to pass hate crime legislation after the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard, Senator Sessions was a vocal opponent.  It is the U.Department of Justice that uses the power of the prosecutor to protect women who have been victims of crime--but Senator Sessions voted no when both Democrats and Republicans came together to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which gives support and assistance to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, including members of our LGBT community.  It is the U.Department of Justice that defends that most fundamental right of freedom to worship--but it was Senator Sessions who was one of the most outspoken defenders of then-candidate and now-President Donald Trump's unconstitutional Muslim travel ban which, by the way, was roundly denounced by many of his fellow  It is the U.Department of Justice that enforces Federal laws prohibiting employment practices that discriminate on the grounds of race, sex, religion, and national origin. But Senator Sessions has opposed the Paycheck Fairness Act, Lilly Ledbetter Act, and the Employee Non-Discrimination  It is the U.Department of Justice that implements the Americans with Disabilities But when both Democrats and Republicans worked to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which provides resources to children with special needs, Senator Sessions said that providing educational services for these children ``may be the single most irritating problem for teachers throughout America today.''  Whether you are the father of a special needs child in a classroom, a woman trying to earn fair pay, an African-American man in a voting booth, or a victim at a police station trying to report a crime, Senator Sessions has not been your advocate.  As a former U.Attorney General, the great Bobby Kennedy once said:       We must recognize the full human equality of all our people      before God, before the law, and in the councils of      government. We must do this, not because it is economically      advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of God and      man command it, although they do; not because people in other      lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and      fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.  The right thing to do. That is what makes us special as a country. That is what makes us right. That is what makes us great--our values and our ideas. It is the belief that no matter who you are, whether young or old, rich or poor, gay or straight; whether you are a child from Oakland or a child from Birmingham; whether you came here by plane to escape the hardships of war and torture or by foot to build a better life; whether you have been the victim of gun violence or opioid addiction; whether you are paid less than others doing the same work or stopped at a red light because of the color of your skin, you deserve an Attorney General who recognizes the full human quality of all people.  It is what led Attorney General Herbert Brownell, when there was rampant voter discrimination and intimidation here in the United States, to create in the United States Department of Justice the Civil Rights Division, whose mission is to ``uphold the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans, particularly some of the most vulnerable members of our society.''  It is what led Attorney General William Rogers to forcefully demand the integration of an elementary school at the Redstone missile center in Alabama when the children of Black servicemembers were being denied entry.  It is that commitment that led Bobby Kennedy to send 500 U.marshals to Oxford, MS, to escort a young Black man, James Meredith, to enroll at Ole It is what led U.Attorney General Elliott Richardson to resign rather than do the bidding of a corrupt President during  It is what led my friend, Attorney General Eric Holder, to sue the State[[Page S945]]of Arizona over SB 1070, a law that led to the unjust racial profiling of immigrants and to say that the U.Government would no longer defend a law that prevented LGBT Americans from expressing their love for one another.  It is what led Attorney General Sally Yates, on a Monday evening this month, to stand up and refuse to defend a Muslim ban.  More than most Cabinet positions, the U.Attorney General enforces the principles that are the founding of our country, but I have seen no evidence in his record or testimony that Senator Sessions will approach this office in furtherance of these noble ideals. The gains our country has made are not permanent, and it is incumbent on the Attorney General of the United States to fight for the civil rights of all people.  No one said it better than Coretta Scott King:       Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in      every generation.  If Senator Sessions won't, then it is incumbent upon the rest of us to persist.  I urge my colleagues to vote no.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

12277,topic-id,2247,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my colleagues in opposing the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General of the United  Now more than ever, it is critical to have an Attorney General who is an independent defender of our Constitution, who puts the rule of law before all else, and who is committed to ensuring that all Americans have equal access to justice. Unfortunately, I do not believe that Senator Sessions is fully committed to enacting those principles, and every American should be concerned that he will not independently stand up to President  Senator Sessions was one of Trump's earliest supporters and has been a key source of influence for the President's actions. White House Strategist Stephen Bannon recently wrote to the Washington Post: ``Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda.''  In the wake of President Trump's first few weeks in office, in which he signed dozens of Executive orders--including the un-American backdoor Muslim ban--it was reported that Senator Sessions played a role in influencing the President's policy and strategy.  My office has heard from thousands in New Hampshire who have had serious legitimate concerns about the President's actions in his first few weeks. I am concerned by reports that Senator Sessions pushed for an even more aggressive approach.  The Washington Post reported: ``The Senator lobbied for a `shock-and-awe' period of executive action that would rattle Congress, impress Trump's base, and catch his critics unaware. . . . `'  Senator Sessions' record in Congress and his history of standing against the constitutionally protected rights of millions of Americans is deeply troubling. These are issues that my office has heard from constituents across New As a resident from Merrimack wrote: ``Pick a current civil rights issue and Sessions is on the wrong side of history.''  I do not have confidence that Senator Sessions would be an independent Attorney General who would put the rights of all Americans before the whims of this President, and that is why I oppose this nomination.  I am incredibly proud that my home State of New Hampshire understands that the values of inclusion and equality are at the very core of what makes us American and at the core of our constitutional system. We believe in freedom and the value of every person, and that is our duty and our destiny--to extend the same freedoms we enjoy to all of our people. We value human rights and we see inclusion and equality as core principles in our laws. These values have helped our State become a leader in advancing the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community, recognizing that all people deserve the legal right to fully participate in the social, civic, and economic life of our communities.  Years ago, New Hampshire led the way in becoming one of the first States in the Nation to pass marriage equality, and I took great pride in casting my vote for that legislation as a State senator. When we passed that legislation, we made clear once again that when we as a State or a country bring people in from the margins into the heart and soul of our democracy, we all get stronger.  About a year after we took that step in New Hampshire to enact marriage equality, I was sitting on a plane in the window seat, and the man next to me noticed my name on the notebook I was reading and said: Aren't you elected in New Hampshire? What do you do there?  I told him I had been a State senator.  He looked at me and said: Did you have anything to do with marriage equality passing?  Now, I wasn't sure what this man's point of view was as I sat next to him on this plane ride. I said: Well, yes, I was in the New Hampshire Senate, and I voted to pass marriage equality.  He said: I want to thank you for it. I am a recruiter for one of our State's largest employers, and marriage equality is one of the best recruitment tools we have.  I asked him to expand a little bit on that. He said: It isn't that we have any particular percentage of LGBTQ applicants or employees that is unusual, but the fact that New Hampshire passed marriage equality signals to people we are trying to recruit that we are an open and inclusive State, where everybody is welcome if they are willing to work hard and do their part to move us forward.  During my time as Governor, we continued to fight for progress for the LGBTQ community, including issuing an executive order to prohibit discrimination in our State government on the basis of gender identity or gender expression.  Unfortunately, Senator Sessions' record and previous comments call into question whether he will enforce the Federal laws designed to promote equality and protect the LGBTQ community. Senator Sessions has been a vocal opponent of marriage equality, going as far as to label same-sex marriages as dangerous.[[Page S902]]  In 2004, he stated: ``But I do believe that it is not disputable that adopting a same-sex marriage culture undermines and weakens marriage.''  Following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision that guaranteed marriage equality in all 50 States, Senator Sessions said: ``The marriage case goes beyond what I consider to be the realm of reality.''  As Attorney General, it would be Senator Sessions' job to implement and defend this ruling. I am extremely concerned that he would not follow through with that responsibility.  Senator Sessions has also worked to undermine the Federal hate crimes law designed to protect LGBTQ In explaining his vote against the 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Sessions argued that Federal protections for LGBTQ Americans were not necessary. When debating the law, Sessions said: ``I am not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination.''  Following Senator Sessions' nomination as Attorney General, Judy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, for whom that law was named, wrote a letter for the Human Rights Campaign opposing Sessions' nomination. Shepard wrote:       In 1998 my son, Matthew, was murdered because he was gay, a      brutal hate crime that continues to resonate around the world      even now.       Following Matt's death, my husband, Dennis, and I worked      for the next 11 years to garner support for the federal Hate      Crimes Prevention We were fortunate to work alongside      members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, who      championed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate      Crimes Prevention Act with the determination, compassion, and      vision to match ours as the parents of a child targeted for      simply wanting to be himself. Senator Jeff Sessions was not      one of these members. In fact, Senator Sessions strongly      opposed the hate crimes bill--characterizing hate crimes as      mere ``thought crimes.''       My son was not killed by ``thoughts'' or because his      murderers said hateful things. My son was brutally beaten      with the butt of a .357 magnum pistol. [They] tied him to a      fence, and left him to die in freezing temperatures because      he was gay. Senator Sessions' repeated efforts to diminish      the life-changing acts of violence covered by the Hate Crimes      Prevention Act horrified me then, as a parent who knows the      true cost of hate, and it terrifies me today to see that this      same person is now being nominated as the country's highest      authority to represent justice and equal protection under the      law for all       As Attorney General, Senator Sessions would be responsible      for not only enforcing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, but a      myriad of other Civil Rights laws including the Violence      Against Women Act, which includes explicit protections for      LGBTQ people. Senator Sessions' very public record of      hostility towards the LGBTQ community and federal legislation      designed to protect vulnerable Americans, including the      Voting Rights Act, makes it nearly impossible to believe that      he will vigorously enforce statutes and ideas that he worked      so hard to defeat.  I agree with Judy Shepherd, and it is clear that Senator Sessions' record shows that he will not stand up for the rights of LGBTQ Granite Staters and Americans if he becomes Attorney  There are other issues of concern as well. I have always fought to protect a woman's constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions and control her own destiny, and I always will. Roe v. Wade is a landmark decision that protects women and their access to abortion. It guarantees a fundamental right for women, and it affirms that a woman has the right to decide whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy without government interference.  Sessions' record leaves questions on whether he will enforce the law in this area. During his time in the Senate, Sessions has been dedicated to opposing a woman's constitutional right to safe and legal abortion. He voted to grant legal status to an embryo. He has repeatedly voted to deny women in the military the right to use their own private funds for abortion care at military hospitals. He has said that he would like to see a woman's constitutional right to make her own health care decisions overturned.  This is unacceptable for a nominee to lead the Department of Justice whose role would be to uphold the very law that he seeks to overturn. We also know that a woman's right to make her own health decisions isn't just a matter of freedom. It is a matter of health. It is also a matter of economics and finances.  When women have to pay more for their health care, and it puts them in an economic disadvantage. As Governor, I restored family planning funds and pushed to restore State funding to Planned Parenthood because I know how critical access to these services are for the women and families of my  Planned Parenthood provides critical primary and preventive health care services to thousands of New Hampshire women, including preventive care, birth control, and cancer screenings. There are countless stories of women whose lives have been changed as a result of access to Planned Parenthood in my  A young woman named Alyssa in my State lost her health insurance. She was on her father's health insurance. She was younger than age 26. Suddenly her father passed away, and then she had a medical emergency. She didn't know where to go. Grieving for her father, she was also without health insurance. She turned to Planned Parenthood, and they were able to provide her the care that she needed.  Alyssa's story and the stories of thousands of others across our State make it clear why it is essential that we have an Attorney General who will protect a woman's constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions.  Senator Sessions has voted six times to block patients from accessing health care at Planned Parenthood health centers. Senator Sessions has stated that Planned Parenthood should not receive Federal funds for any services because, among the other health care services it provides, it provides the constitutionally protected care--abortion--that a woman needs when she decides she must terminate a pregnancy.  Senator Sessions has opposed women's access to no-cost birth control that is now provided through the Affordable Care Sessions even refused to condemn President Trump's remarks in the ``Access Hollywood'' tapes released last year, saying that he did not characterize the behavior President Trump described as sexual assault.  He voted against the 2014 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which is critical for the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women. The Violence Against Women Act was signed into law by President Clinton in 1994 and has been reauthorized by bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2000 and 2005 and signed by President George  The idea that the Attorney General of the United States would not support his commonsense legislation to protect women from violence is unacceptable. As Governor, I also fought to expand economic opportunity for women and families.  We passed the New Hampshire Paycheck Fairness Act in New Hampshire, making sure that an equal day's work gets an equal day's pay.  I also strongly support efforts to expand paid family leave to ensure that workers are able to support their families during times of need at home.  I am troubled that Senator Sessions has worked to roll back the progress of equal pay. Senator Sessions voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and has consistently voted against the Paycheck Fairness  I am far from the only one in New Hampshire who opposes the idea of Senator Sessions as our Nation's top law enforcement officer. I have heard from many of my constituents regarding the impact of Senator Sessions' nomination on women's right.  One constituent wrote:       I truly fear for the future of women's rights and my      daughter's right to an autonomous life if Jeff Sessions is      confirmed. The bottom line, Senator Sessions has a record of      undermining the civil and constitutional rights of women in      this country.  On another topic, in recent weeks there has been much discussion about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, otherwise known as IDEA, and the fact that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos seemed confused about the fact that IDEA is Federal law and also declined to commit to enforcing it.

12309,topic-id,1012,"Madam President, I want to take a few moments to discuss an issue, one that is on everybody's mind; that is, the status of Congress has taken the first step to repeal I was in the House of Representatives when ObamaCare was passed into law. I opposed the law five times while I was in the House before it was passed with zero bipartisan, zero Republican support and was signed into law by the  I opposed ObamaCare because I feared that this law would increase costs, make it harder for patients to see a doctor, increase taxes on the middle class, increase taxes on seniors, and hurt the economy.  Over the last 7 years, all of these fears have become a reality. A new Congress and a new administration have heard the people's response loud and clear, and that response is that we must repeal Repealing ObamaCare means repealing all of the taxes that go with it--not part of them, not some of them, but all of them.  ObamaCare increased taxes on hard-working Americans by $1.1 trillion. Higher taxes lead to more money being taken out of the pockets of hard-working families. Health care costs have increased to a degree where I have heard from Nevadans across the State, of all ages and backgrounds, all with similar concerns.  What I wish to do is take a moment to read an email that I received just last week from a 13-year-old boy who lives in Las He said:       I wanted to write an email to express my concerns about      Obamacare and hopefully persuade you in making a change.       My family used to have health insurance until ObamaCare      kicked in and forced my family to drop our insurance since it      tripled the cost and wasn't affordable. We are getting      penalized now for not having insurance.  Think about that. ObamaCare kicked their family off their insurance by tripling the costs, making it unaffordable, and then ObamaCare penalized that family for not having insurance.  Going back to the young boy, he said:       Since then we have had medical bills piling up. This is an      issue with a lot of people and I don't know a lot about      policies but I do know that something needs to change for the      good of the people.       I've heard President Donald Trump will be addressing this      issue. I just hope you will represent Nevada in favor of      getting rid of  I can assure my constituents back home in Nevada, and especially this young man who is advocating for his family, that I am committed to repealing This young man's parents had employer-sponsored health care coverage that took care of their family when they needed medical care. And as a result of ObamaCare, the costs were too high to afford the health insurance they had.  One of the biggest drivers of cost increases on the middle class is the 40-percent excise tax on employee health benefits, better known as the Cadillac tax. In Nevada, 1.3 million workers who have employer-sponsored health insurance plans will be hit by this Cadillac tax. These are public employees in Carson These are service industry workers on the Strip in Las These are small business owners and retirees across the  We are talking about reduced benefits, increased premiums, and higher deductibles. When I first started working on this issue, I knew the devastating impact this tax would have on Nevadans, but also in order to get anything done, we needed a bipartisan effort to reduce this tax and to eliminate it.  I recruited a good friend by the name of Senator Martin Heinrich from New[[Page S922]]Mexico, and together we were able to gain huge support on both sides of the aisle. During the highly partisan reconciliation debate in 2015, where Congress successfully delivered an ObamaCare repeal bill to President Obama's desk, Senator Heinrich and I pushed our colleagues to include our legislation to fully repeal the Cadillac tax as an amendment.  Our amendment passed with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 90 to 10. With this nearly unanimous vote, we were are able to delay the Cadillac tax until 2020.  This Congress, Senator Heinrich and I have reintroduced Senate bill 58, the Middle Class Health Benefits Repeal Tax Act, which fully repeals this bad tax. I hope that my Senate colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join Senator Heinrich on this bipartisan piece of legislation and on this issue to support our bill and get rid of this Cadillac tax once and for all.  I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will have a lot of differing opinions on the Affordable Care Act, but one thing we can agree on is that the Cadillac tax should be fully repealed.  Now that we have passed an ObamaCare repeal resolution, we will move to the next phase of the repeal process. The budget we just passed included reconciliation instructions for the Senate Finance Committee and the HELP Committee to repeal  We made a promise to repeal ObamaCare, and now it is time to keep that promise. This includes my legislation to fully repeal the Cadillac tax. The goal of health reform should be to lower costs for those who already have health benefits and to expand access to those who do not currently have coverage. ObamaCare did not achieve either of those two goals.  I am committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to high-quality, affordable health care. We must start by repealing the Cadillac tax.  I thank Senator Heinrich for his continued leadership on this issue. I want to thank him, and I want to say that Senator Heinrich continues to put his constituents above politics. I know that he shares my commitment to repeal this bad tax.  I also want to thank Congressman Kelly and Congressman Courtney for their leadership on the House side. I know that we are all eager to work together to get this bill to the finish line.  Madam President, I yield to the senior Senator from  The PRESIDING The majority whip.

12294,topic-id,1638,"Mr.President, I have served with Jeff Sessions throughout my time in the Senate and respect him very much as a colleague. I come to the floor of the Senate today not to decide whether Jeff Sessions is doing a good job as the Senator from Alabama, for, of course, that is for his constituents to decide; I come to the floor today to vote on whether to support Jeff Sessions for Attorney General of all the people of America, not just the people of That is an awesomely different role and responsibility.  I have deep concerns about Jeff Sessions' independence from the President and how he would use his prosecutorial discretion to address a number of critical issues confronting our country.  The Attorney General is the American people's lawyer, not the President's, and the job requires the Attorney General to stand up to the President as the people's lawyer.  In his first 2 weeks in office, President Trump has demonstrated his intolerance of dissent and independent thinking. He fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates because she did what an Attorney General is supposed to do: She stood up and refused to defend President Trump's Executive order effectively restricting Muslims from coming to or returning to our country. Would Jeff Sessions have stood up to the President as Sally Yates did?  During his confirmation hearing, I asked Senator Sessions if he would honor the historical role of the Attorney General and maintain strict independence from the White I did not receive a satisfactory answer. This is deeply troubling in light of the ongoing litigation in Federal court challenging the President's Muslim ban as overreaching and unconstitutional.  Since the President announced the ban just over a week ago, hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to oppose it. Lawyers have been camping out in arrivals terminals in airports across the country to help those who are trying to come back or come to our country with legal visas. State attorneys general have been speaking out and filing lawsuits to block this ban.  Last week, Hawaii attorney general Doug Chin filed a lawsuit to block the Executive order. I wish to read a section from the State's brief outlining the State's case.       Hawaii joins the many voices that have condemned the      But this pleading is not about politics or rhetoric--it is      about the law. The simple fact is that the Order is unlawful.      By banning Muslims and creating a preference for Christian      refugees, the Order violates the Establishment Clause of the      United States By those same acts, it violates      the equal protection guarantee of the fifth amendment. By      failing utterly to provide procedures or protections of any      kind for people detained or turned away at our airports, it      violates the Due Process And by enshrining rank      discrimination on the basis of nationality and religion, it      flies in the face of statutes enacted by  Attorney General Chin is standing up for the people of The people of the United States deserve the same from our Attorney  To understand how an Attorney General should discharge his or her responsibility, we need only turn to Senator Sessions' own words in an exchange between Sally Yates and Senator Sessions during her confirmation hearing in 2015.  I wish to read the exchange. Senator Sessions said at her confirmation hearing:       Do you understand that in this political world, there will      be people calling, demanding, pushing, insisting on things      that they do not know what they're asking for and could      indeed be corrosive of the rule of law, could diminish the      respect the Department of Justice has, could diminish the      rule of law in the United States? Are you aware of that?      You've already learned that the time you've been there.  Nominee Yates said:       Well, you're right, Senator, I'm not from here. I've only      been here for a couple of months, but I can tell you I'm      committed to the Department of       I love our department. I care deeply about our mission, and      I would do everything in my power to protect the integrity      that is the Department of Justice.''  Senator Sessions said:       You have to watch out, because people will be asking you to      do things you just need to say no about. Do you think the      Attorney General has the responsibility to say ``no'' to[[Page S914]]     the President if he asks for something that is improper? If      the views of the President are unlawful, should the Attorney      General or the Deputy Attorney General say no?  Yates' response:       Senator, I believe the AG or deputy AG has an obligation to      follow the law and the Constitution and to give their      independent legal advice to the  The people of the United States need an Attorney General who will stand up to the President to defend the Constitution--especially, as Senator Sessions pointed out in his questions of Nominee Yates, when the President is wrong.  Based on Nominee Sessions' long-held restrictive views on immigration, I do not think he would stand up to the President as Sally Yates did. I am also deeply concerned about how Senator Sessions would use his prosecutorial discretion to address a number of critical issues.  During his confirmation hearing, I pressed Senator Sessions for a commitment to vigorously protect every citizens' right to vote, particularly with regard to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which safeguards Americans from discriminatory voting laws.  At a time when our President is making unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud, we need an Attorney General who will vigorously protect the right to vote and not give in to these kinds of alternative facts to justify voter suppression laws.  Senator Sessions did not provide me with a satisfactory answer that he would affirmatively scrutinize voting laws for impermissible discriminatory impact. If the Attorney General does not weigh in on these kinds of situations, this means that challenging these kinds of voting laws, these kinds of impermissible discriminatory voting laws, will be left to individuals and groups with limited resources, such as the  I also asked Senator Sessions whether he would honor the Department of Justice's consent decrees, some 20 of them, that address police misconduct and enhance accountability. Senator Sessions did not adequately assure me that as Attorney General, he would uphold these amendments. In fact, he left the door open for renegotiating these agreements. I pressed Senator Sessions for a commitment to defend Roe v. Wade in Federal court and to enforce laws that guarantee the constitutionally protected women's right to choose. Senator Sessions refused to disavow his past comments that Roe v. Wade was one of the worst Supreme Court cases ever decided and, in his view, not based on the Constitution, when, in fact, the majority decision had a constitutional basis.  Should the Supreme Court be presented with a case that provides them the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, I asked Senator Sessions, would he instruct the Solicitor General to argue for the overturning of Roe v. Wade? He said that was a hypothetical and did not respond. Senator Sessions' view on Roe v. Wade is clear. Would anyone be surprised if, as Attorney General, he would support overturning Roe v. Wade given that opportunity?  In addition, in one of his first actions, the President reinstated a ban on foreign aid to health providers abroad who discussed abortion. This vow would compromise the health care of millions of women in places where the need is greatest. Taking the President's lead, I seriously question whether his Cabinet nominees, including the Attorney General nominee, will protect a woman's right to choose.  I want to turn again to the topics of President Trump's Executive order, basically banning Muslim immigration, because our next Attorney General will likely weigh in on this, as well as other immigration cases. In fact, the Justice Department is already in Federal courts right now defending President Trump's Muslim ban. So while there is an argument being made that this really is not a Muslim ban, I say, you can call a duck a chicken, but if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it is a duck. That is what this Executive order is, a Muslim ban.  Sadly, stoking fears in minorities and immigrants is a tragic but undeniable part of our Nation's history, and this fear has been used to justify the terrible treatment of minorities from Native peoples to slaves, to immigrants who helped build our country. In 1882, decades of incitement against Chinese immigrants resulted in the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, an immoral law that banned all Chinese immigration. This law, and others that followed, created a culture of fear that culminated in the mass internment of Japanese Americans during World War  This was one of the darkest periods of American history, and it took decades for our country to acknowledge our error.  Last week, we commemorated what would have been civil rights icon Fred Korematsu's 98th birthday. As Japanese Americans were rounded up for incarceration, Mr.Korematsu, who was only 23 at the time, bravely resisted internment all the way to the Supreme Court, which upheld Mr.Korematsu's conviction as being justified by the exigencies of war. Forty years later, documents kept from the Supreme Court showed that the Americans of Japanese ancestry were not involved in seditious actions justifying mass incarceration. Mr.Korematsu waited more than 40 years for a court in California to overturn his conviction.  During the Judiciary Committee's markup on this nomination, I read the full text of President Ronald Reagan's remarks in 1988, apologizing for the internment. I would like to read some of the excerpts.  I do see the majority leader here. Would you like me to yield?

12297,topic-id,980,"I would like to resume my remarks.  Mr.President, I want to read some excerpts from President Ronald Reagan's remarks in 1988, apologizing for the internment of Japanese       More than 40 years ago, shortly after the bombing of Pearl      Harbor, 120,000 persons of Japanese ancestry living in the      United States were forcibly removed from their homes and      placed in makeshift internment camps. This action was taken      without trial, without jury. It was based solely on race, for      these 120,000 were Americans of Japanese descent.[[Page S915]]       Yet we must recognize that the internment of Japanese      Americans was just that: a mistake. For throughout the war,      Japanese Americans in the tens of thousands remained utterly      loyal to the United Indeed, scores of Japanese      Americans volunteered for our Armed Forces, many stepping      forward in the internment camps themselves.       The 442nd Regimental Combat Team, made up entirely of      Japanese Americans, served with immense distinction to defend      this Nation, their Yet back at home, the soldiers'      families were being denied the very freedom for which so many      of the soldiers themselves were laying down their lives.       The legislation that I am about to sign provides for a      restitution payment to each of the 60,000 surviving Japanese      Americans of the 120,000 who were relocated or detained. Yet      no payment can make up for those lost years. So, what is most      important in this bill has less to do with property than with      honor. For here we admit a wrong; here, we reaffirm our      commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.  President Reagan's words powerfully demonstrated the wrongness of the internment, but just after this Presidential election, a top Trump surrogate said that the Japanese internment should be used as ``precedent'' for a Muslim registry. And a Supreme Court Justice, Justice Scalia, in 2014, warned that a civil rights atrocity similar to the internment of Japanese Americans could happen again. Justice Scalia explained his thinking with the Latin phrase that means: ``In times of war, the laws fall silent.'' Justice Scalia in 2014, went on to say:       That is what was going on--the panic about the war, and the      invasion of the Pacific and whatnot. That's what happens. It      was wrong, but I would not be surprised to see it happen      again--in times of war. It's no justification, but it is the      reality.  The internment of Japanese Americans is yet another example of how, when we do not stand up against unconstitutional actions like President Trump's Muslim ban, we will be complicit in what follows. Time and again, when our country targets minorities for discriminatory treatment, history proves us to have been deeply wrong. I commend my Republican colleagues, Senators Graham, McCain, Hatch, Flake, Sasse, and others, for their statements questioning President Trump's immigration Executive order.  Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain issued a joint statement, which I would like to read in whole because I very much admire the position they took. In their joint statement they said:       Our government has the responsibility to defend our      borders, but we must do so in a way that makes us safer and      upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our       It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the      nation that President Trump's Executive order was not      properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports      that this order went into effect with little to no      consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice,      and Homeland       We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the      country they call home. We should not stop those who have      served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from      seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to      help.       And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have      been shown, through extensive vetting, to pose no      demonstrable threat to our Nation, and who have suffered      unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.       Ultimately, we fear this Executive order will become a      self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this      very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with      our Iraqi partners to defeat       But this Executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to      military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies.       Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the      vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology      of hatred.       This Executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that      America does not want Muslims coming into our country.       That is why we fear this Executive order may do more to      help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.  That is the end of the joint statement by Senators McCain and I read the statement and I cannot but admire our two Senators for making the statements. I cannot overstate the fearful message that President Trump is sending by pursuing this ban on  Last night, our colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, was silenced for sharing a letter from Coretta Scott If we cannot make a distinction between talking about a fellow Senator from a person who is a nominee that we must confirm, then the rule that shuts down debate should be called a gag rule.  Over the last 2 months, I have heard from thousands of my constituents and a number of prominent civil rights organizations, including a number who testified at Jeff Sessions' hearing questioning his nomination. So I will vote against the nomination of Jeff Sessions to serve as Attorney General because I am deeply concerned about how he would use his prosecutorial discretion to uphold voting rights, protect civil rights, and safeguard a woman's right to choose. I am seriously concerned about Jeff Sessions' willingness to say no to the President when he needs to.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

12196,topic-id,1631,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Maryland (Mr.[[Page H2742]]Raskin). It has been such a pleasure since coming to Congress--and it seems difficult to believe that it has been almost 3 months--but it has been such a pleasure to co-lead this Special Order hour with the gentleman and to really bring to the public all of the issues that we feel are so important in the Progressive Caucus, issues that have ranged from the issue we are talking about now with the Supreme Court nomination, to issues around health care, immigration, the Muslim ban, and many others.  I think that the vision that we are trying to make sure people understand for the Progressive Caucus and certainly for Democrats is a vision of inclusion, a vision that respects the rights of everybody, regardless of what gender you are, regardless of what race or religion you might be.  This moment is, in fact, very important. Tomorrow, Senate Republicans will attempt to push through President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil I stand with my colleague, Mr.Raskin, and with our other Democratic colleagues in the Senate who are opposing this nomination because I truly believe that confirming Neil Gorsuch to this position would be a devastating backslide for numerous communities.  I want to go through some of the communities that would be affected and how. Women, people of color, people living with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ community will have to wonder if the conservative majority on the Supreme Court is going to systematically remove their protections and strip them of their rights.  Unfortunately, Neil Gorsuch, though an accomplished justice in his own right, does have a track record of doing that throughout his judicial career. So this isn't as simple as saying: Well, you blocked our nominee; therefore, we are going to block your nominee.  This is about the issues and the refusal he has had to answer some of the questions before the committee.  I did want to reflect briefly on the fact that yesterday was Equal Pay Ninety-four days into the year, Equal Pay Day symbolizes the amount of extra time that it takes for a woman to earn the same amount as a man. We have got to work--I see the heads nodding up there in the Chamber--extra hard for an additional 3 months and some days in order to earn the same wages as a man.  When you break it down by race, the gap widens even further. Black women working full time year round only earn 63 cents to the dollar. For them, Equal Pay Day comes on July 31. Latina women earn a mere 54 cents, which means that their Equal Pay Day--get this--is November 2.  Over a lifetime, the financial losses that women face due to this gap are immense. On average, a 20-year-old woman will lose $418,000 over the course of her 40-year career. For Black women, they will lose $840,000. Latinas will lose more than $1 million.  Now, why do I bring this up in the context of Judge Gorsuch?  Because I believe that as we mark Equal Pay Day, we need to know that we will have a Supreme Court Justice who will, in fact, crack down on the gender pay gap and enforce the law.  Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch has a history of prioritizing big business over people. In fact, he has ruled in favor of employers in two-thirds of the employment and labor disputes that have been brought before him on the basis of discrimination. Let's be clear: Equal Pay Day and the situation that women face is about discrimination.  Gorsuch ruled against an African-American man who claimed that he was fired because of racial discrimination in Johnson v. Oklahoma Department of  In Poindexter v. Board of County Commissioners of the County of Sequoyah, he ruled against a man who argued that he was demoted because of his political views.  His opinion in Strickland v. UPS was particularly troubling. The court ruled in favor of a female employee who had been discriminated against based on sex. Judge Gorsuch, though, wrote a dissenting opinion, despite the fact that the woman's male colleagues testified that she was required to attend counseling sessions while they were not, even though she was out performing them.  The court ruled in her favor, but, again, Judge Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States of America, went out of his way to undermine her.  Perhaps the clearest example of Gorsuch's affinity for big business was his ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, which many people across the country may know about. He ruled that private corporations should enjoy the same constitutional protections as people.  Not only are people being told that the money of corporations represents protected speech, but women across this country are being told that those corporations can make decisions about women's health care and their rights to make decisions about their own body. This case sent a clear signal that Judge Gorsuch is no friend of women's reproductive rights.  It isn't a surprise, frankly, that this President chose him, because he does fit right into this administration's all-out assault that we have seen since the beginning of this Congress on women's rights to make decisions about their bodies and their health care.  Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion arguing that the Affordable Care Act forced employers to violate their religious beliefs by providing birth control. It is our right to choose whether and when we want to have families. But rather than coming to the conclusion that corporations should be required to allow women to make their own healthcare decisions, Judge Gorsuch made it very clear that he stands with big business and against women's rights.  His appointment is a deep threat to something that I have appreciated my whole life and that women before me have fought for so hard. His appointment is a threat to Roe v. Wade, which has protected women's rights to abortion access.  Trump has said many times that he intended to appoint a Justice who would overturn Roe v. While being questioned in his confirmation hearing, Judge Gorsuch sidestepped all of the questions on this issue, but his views are obvious. He has questioned and argued against the legal foundation of a woman's right to choose, and he has been critical of the decisions of Roe v. Wade's and its reliance on the right to privacy and the substantive due process rationale.  That is unacceptable. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and it has helped save the lives of millions of women across our country. We need to make sure that we protect that right to choose and continue to allow abortion access in this country.  Judge Gorsuch has also taken actions that signal his support for the defunding of Planned Of course, we remember the doctored videos that came out to destroy Planned Parenthood's image. Utah Governor Gary Herbert attempted to defund the organization, but the tenth circuit issued an injunction. Gorsuch stood with the He even went so far as to push for a rehearing by the full court, without being asked by the The court refused. Gorsuch issued then a dissenting opinion that relied on the very fallacies that the Governor was pushing.  We cannot afford to have this critical vote on the Supreme Court go to someone who so clearly intends to undermine women's fundamental and constitutional rights.  Judge Gorsuch has also shown that he presents a threat to the LGBT community. In 2005, he wrote that people should rely on the ballot box to achieve marriage equality.  During his confirmation hearing, he was asked about cases that involve LGBT people as a class. This qualification is important because it adds heightened scrutiny. Apparently, Gorsuch was not comfortable with this, because he dodged the question. That is alarming. Our LGBT community does face discrimination at extremely high rates. This is not a speculation; it is fact.  Gorsuch could not even give a straight answer when Senator Dianne Feinstein asked if he agreed with Justice Scalia that there is ``no protection for women or gays or lesbians under the equal protection law.''  With States around the country attempting to pass discriminatory bills, it is crucial that we have a Supreme Court Justice who will apply that heightened scrutiny.  Finally, people living with disabilities are also fearful of this appointment and the possibility that Judge[[Page H2743]]Gorsuch might be our next Supreme Court  In Luke P., a case involving a severely autistic student, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a State can provide an education offering minimal educational progress to students with disabilities.  Rather than requiring States to fulfill their responsibilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Judge Gorsuch was satisfied with putting a student's learning potential at severe risk. In the middle of his confirmation hearing, the current Supreme Court unanimously overruled his decision.  What does that say about his judgment? Do we want a Supreme Court who gets it wrong on so many issues?  Judge Gorsuch should not be appointed to the Supreme The fact that Senate Republicans are threatening the nuclear option if Democrats filibuster his appointment is just terrifying. It would have long-lasting consequences, and it is inappropriate to select a man for this key position to the United States Supreme Court who makes decisions about so many issues that affect all Americans across our country.  It is not right that they would make that on a purely partisan ideological basis. There should be a 60-vote threshold. We should make sure that they understand that, if they do this and they go to the nuclear option, it will have long-lasting consequences for them in their districts, in their offices, and also for the entire country.                              {time}  1730  ",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2741-2.txt,99999999999999,TWENTY-FIFTH AMENDMENT,2017.0,5.0,February
12346,topic-id,1210,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be Attorney I thought very carefully about this matter and about what it means to oppose a colleague. We had an unusual night last night, where one of our Members was ordered to stop speaking as she explained her opposition. Comments that[[Page S957]]would have been allowed regarding any other Cabinet nominee were ruled unacceptable because this nominee also sits in this body. I voted to overturn that ruling and restore my colleague's speaking privileges because I was of the opinion that the constitutional duty to advise and consent on nominations should allow for debate.  But whatever my opinions about the ruling, I do have to acknowledge that standing on the floor to speak in opposition to a colleague is not an everyday occurrence. We do disagree every day, all of us, even within our own caucuses on matters of policy, but there is something more personal about taking the floor to take a position regarding a sitting Senator who has been nominated for a Senate-confirmable position.  I know Senator Sessions well. We served together on the Armed Services We attend a weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast together. We have taken codel trips together. I consider Senator Sessions a friend, and I respect that he has been repeatedly sent to this body by the voters of his State, but while we can and should be friends, strive to be friends, in this Chamber, we are not ultimately here about friendship. We are here to do people's business. And significant differences in our opinions and convictions are not to be papered over, even when we find ourselves in different positions than our friends.  Some Members of this body ran for President, and I did not support them, even though they were my friends. And some people in this Chamber did not support me to be Vice President, even though we are friends. There is nothing unusual about that. We all understand it. We must treat each other with respect and civility. We are still called to, in the words of Lincoln, ``be firm in the right as God gives us to see what is right.''  So based upon how I see the right and on my convictions, I cannot support my colleague for the position because I do not have confidence in his ability to be a champion for civil rights, to wisely advise the administration on matters involving immigration, and to be resolute as the Nation's chief law enforcement official that torture is contrary to American values.  This one matters to me a lot. This appointment is very critical. The Attorney General is one of the four Cabinet appointees who are not allowed to be engaged in political activity: Secretary of Treasury, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Secretary of They are beyond politics and supposed to be above politics. They must have an independent gravitas and even be willing to challenge the The mission of the Department of Justice cannot be more important. For 17 years, before I got into State politics, I was a civil rights lawyer. I read a book, ``Simple Justice,'' when I was in law school, about the lawyers who battled to end segregated education in this country. Even though I really didn't know any lawyers and certainly didn't know any civil rights lawyers--and was living in kind of an Irish Catholic neighborhood in the suburbs of Kansas City--I decided I wanted to devote my life to this.  So I moved to Virginia in 1984 and started practicing civil rights law, and I did it for 17 years. I will always remember--and I bet you will too--my first client, the first case that I had that was really mine. A young woman who walked into my office and told me she had been turned away from an apartment, and she thought it was because of the color of her skin. I was able to prove that was the case, and so we were able to win, but what I remember about Lorraine was how it made her feel. She was my age. She had just finished school. She was looking for an apartment, her first apartment away from home, just like I had done. While my experience getting a job, finding an apartment, getting out on my own had been a positive, her experience had been a negative. And she was going to have that feeling and carry it with her every time she looked for a house for the rest of her life: Am I going to be treated differently because of the color of my skin? What had been a happy occasion for me, as a young man venturing out into the world, had been a sad one and a difficult one for her. That started 17 years of fighting in State and Federal courthouses for people who had been turned away from housing or fired or slander or otherwise treated poorly, either because of their race or their disability or because of their advocacy about important public policy issues.  The civil rights laws of this country protect the liberty of minorities of all kinds who otherwise could be tyrannized by the majority view in their community. The promise of equal justice under the law is sacrosanct and fundamental. And in this battle, the Attorney General is the guardian of liberty, or in a wise Biblical phrase, the ``Watcher on the Wall.''  Judges sit in their courts and they wait for cases to come to them, but an Attorney General is charged with going out and finding wrongdoing and making sure it stopped. None of the advances that our country has made in the civil rights field has happened without a supportive Department of Justice and Attorney And those of us out in the field, lawyers who were taking cases, but especially the clients who simply seek equal justice under law, they have to view the Attorney General as their champion.  In 1963, a married couple in Northeast DC sat down at their kitchen table not far from here, and they wrote a letter to a lawyer in town. I want to read the letter to you.

12340,topic-id,707,"Mr.President, I rise to support the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United States of America, and I would like to explain why.  It seems to me that most Americans don't care about the politics on Capitol They don't particularly care about the politics in the Senate, and they don't especially care about the politics in Washington, Most Americans are too busy earning a living. These are the Americans who get up every day, they go to work, they work hard, they obey the law, they try to do the right thing by their kids, and they try to save a little money for retirement.  Most Americans I think are fairminded, and most Americans are commonsensical. They understand that when they elect a President, the President can't do the job alone. He gets help, and he starts with appointing members of his Of course, the Senate has to provide advice and consent and confirm those appointees.  Most Americans understand that a President--whoever the President--is not going to pick his enemies to do that. He is not going to pick somebody he doesn't trust. He is not going to pick someone to advise him if he is not qualified. He is going to pick someone he is on friendly terms with. He is going to pick somebody who is competent. He is going to pick somebody who is experienced. That is what President Trump has done. That is what President Obama did. That is what Secretary Hillary Clinton would have done, had she been elected  Now, President Trump has nominated Senator Jeff I recognize that not all Americans and not all Members of the Senate agree with his political positions. Some folks don't agree with his political party. Some folks don't like him because they don't like the person who appointed him. I[[Page S949]]get that. Some folks may not even like the part of the country he is from. That is This is In America, you can believe anything you want to believe, and as long as you don't hurt anybody, you can say it.  But it seems to me that no reasonable person, if they look at Senator Jeff Sessions' record, can argue that he is not qualified, if by qualified you mean that he has any potential to be a great Attorney  This is a man who has served as a State attorney general. This is a man who was a U.attorney not for 1 year or 5 years or 6 years. For 12 years he served as a U.attorney. This is a gentleman who has been a U.Senator for 20 years, three terms, and three times the good people of Alabama have sent Jeff Sessions to this body.  Most people here know him. They have had lunch with him. They have met his family. They have worked with him on bills. They have worked against him on bills. They know him, and they know he is qualified.  There has been a lot of discussion about whether Senator Sessions will respect the rule of law. He will. He understands the difference between making policy, as Congress does, and executing policy. I have no doubt whatsoever that Senator Sessions, as the next Attorney General, will be more than willing to enforce laws that he might not necessarily agree with.  There has been some discussion about Senator Sessions and the Bill of Senator Sessions understands the importance of personal liberty. I listened very attentively in the Judiciary He was asked a lot of questions about our It is clear to me that Senator Sessions understands that the Bill of Rights is not for the high school quarterback. The Bill of Rights is not for the prom queen. The Bill of Rights is there to protect the unprotected, the man or woman in America who might want to do things a little differently. He understands that very, very clearly.  At some point, we all have to stop regretting yesterday, and we have to start creating tomorrow, and that is the point we are at.

12467,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern with the recent FCC decision that strips Charter Communications of the requirement to provide broadband in a competitive manner.  When Charter merged with Time Warner, there was a regulatory review, and the requirement was that Charter would actually provide broadband in areas that would improve competition. Just yesterday, the Chairman revoked that regulatory decision and said that Charter doesn't have to provide broadband in an area where some other competitor is providing broadband.  Now, why does this matter? Americans already pay three to four times more for access to the internet than our European counterparts, and that is absurd. We invented the internet. We built the technology that fuels the internet. We should have the cheapest prices.  So why don't we have cheaper prices? It is because four or five monopolies basically provide the internet service for everyone. You have Verizon, AT&T,  What is the solution? We need more competition.  But what is this FCC Chairman doing? He is having policies that are going to lead to less competition, basically carving up the map of this country and saying: You can only provide service here. Don't compete with anyone else.  Let's just carve up the map so every ISP provides service in a particular area and you don't have competition. And who suffers? The consumers.  And, by the way, it is not just the consumers in my district in Silicon It is consumers in rural America who are paying the highest prices for internet service.  Mr.Speaker, we need an FCC that is going to promote competition, that is going to go after monopolies, that is going to put American citizens ahead of corporate profits. If anything, we need a country that is going to have universal broadband, universal internet access.  Just like we talk about having a universal right to health care, just like we talk about a universal right to college, we can't live in a society where everyone can't have access to the internet. The jobs of the future are going to require it, and it ought to be a bipartisan issue to have universal access to the internet at the cheapest prices, cheaper than any other country, not five or six times more expensive than other countries, given that all of the technology was developed here in the United  And one final point. Noah Smith and Heather Boushey and others have talked about what really will create the jobs of the future, and they have written about having universities and colleges spread out across this country. Abraham Lincoln did it with the land grants in the 1860s.  We need college towns across America, and if we did that, if we expanded our universities, if we expanded research, if we expanded broadband in a competitive place, we could create the jobs of the future all across this great country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2702.txt,99999999999999,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,5.0,February
12458,topic-id,3106,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to join my colleagues in speaking on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme As you know, Senators have a solemn obligation to advise and consent on a President's nominee for the Supreme Court, and I take that obligation very seriously.  My goal during the hearing as a member of the committee was to understand the judge's view on the law, his judicial record, and his philosophy. We needed to know what kind of Justice he would be and what that would mean for  Although many cases decided by the lower courts are less complicated, even though some of them are complicated, many of them are more straightforward than the ones that come before the Supreme The cases that go before the Supreme Court are the hardest cases. They involve the most complicated legal gray areas.  I have heard my colleagues many times talk about some of the unanimous decisions that the judge was involved in. I know that. But when I look at the kinds of cases that come before the Supreme Court, those are different kinds of cases. As I looked over the judge's record, I tried to focus on situations where he faced hard cases like those he might decide as a Supreme Court In my mind, the question was this: What would Judge Gorsuch do if he were appointed to the Supreme Court? What kind of philosophy would he have?  In difficult cases, one judicial approach is to try to find consensus by ruling on the narrowest possible grounds. Judge Merrick Garland, who was nominated last year, was known and praised for that approach by Senators on both sides of the aisle.  Congress actually provides a helpful analogy. When Democrats and Republicans pass legislation, we try to find common ground. We often have different views, but we do find areas of consensus. Sometimes that ground is narrow, but we can find agreement and then come together.[[Page S2356]]  In reviewing the judge's record, I saw that he often took a different approach, one where he often tried to go a step further than the consensus opinion, sometimes really further than the consensus opinion by suggesting a provocative change in the law or by making a broader ideological leap, which I felt was not consistent with the precedent and was not consistent with the kind of philosophy of a judge that, regardless of their political beliefs--I did not expect to agree with everything he said or how he answered the questions, but what I saw was a strikingly different philosophy.  Many of the judge's opinions presented opportunities for narrow judicial consensus, but the judge decided more than the case in front of him. That is what concerns me if he were to be confirmed to the Supreme Court, where he would have to decide the toughest cases and hardest legal questions facing our country.  So after thorough examination and consideration of his answers and the record, I have decided not to vote in favor of the judge's nomination. His judicial approach and his record on critical cases, including the rights of children with disabilities, campaign finance, and preserving health and safety protections, have led me to conclude that I cannot support his nomination to the Supreme  Let me make this clear. Again, I did not expect to agree with every opinion he wrote or everything he said. I certainly did appreciate the introductions of the Presiding Officer, as well as Senator Bennet, and the support he had from That meant something to me. But then when I looked at the record, what I saw time and time again was a judge who clearly demonstrated the contrast between a narrow consensus-based approach and a more far-reaching one.  One area where the judge has gone further to issue broad rulings that would have profound consequences on people's lives is in the case he decided on children with disabilities. During the hearing, because this case had been decided by the Supreme Court right before I got to ask questions, I asked a lot of questions about this case on the IDEA, also known as the Individuals With Disabilities Education  The IDEA was passed to ensure that students with the disabilities are supported in school. In my State, 124,000 children rely on this critical protection. I occupy the Senate seat once held by Minnesota's own Hubert Humphrey--someone who, of course, was never at a loss for words. In fact, this very desk that I am standing behind was the desk Hubert Humphrey signed and used. He delivered a speech 40 years ago, and one line of that speech is just as appropriate today as it was back then.  He said: ``The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life: the children; those who are in the twilight of life: the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life: the needy, the sick, and the disabled.''  The Supreme Court has honored that principle. On the day of the judge's hearing, the Supreme Court, in an 8-to-0 unanimous decision, ruled against the narrow interpretation of the IDEA embraced by Judge Gorsuch--an interpretation that limited the educational opportunities of children with disabilities. I could not agree with the 8-to-0 decision more.  All children, particularly those with disabilities, deserve the tools they need to succeed in life, and every Justice on the Supreme Court has a duty to protect these kids. So when the Supreme Court ruled that morning and overturned the standard that the judge had embraced in this Tenth Circuit case, I asked him about his ``merely more than de minimus'' standard that he wrote into that opinion back in 2006.  In explaining his ruling, the judge said that he was bound by precedent to use the narrow standard that he used in that case. He cited a 1996 case from the Tenth Circuit--his circuit--that he said he was bound to follow. Now, he was not on the court back in 1996, but when he did the case in 2006, he used that 1996 case. So I looked at that case.  During the hearing and at the Judiciary Committee business meeting earlier this week, my Republican colleagues repeated those words. They said that the judge was bound by precedent to use his narrow, ``merely more than de minimus'' standard that had, in fact, been rejected by the Supreme Court just this past month. So I looked to see if, in fact, that was true. Was he truly bound by precedent? That is pretty important to me. There have been a number of decisions where he has gone much further than he needed to, where he, in my mind, has abandoned precedent.  I thought, well, here we have a case that is fresh, right before us, and he has said that he was simply following the precedent, that he had no choice at all. Here is what I found: While the 1996 case made a number of findings and concluded that the school district satisfied the requirement in the IDEA statute of providing an appropriate education, the case never actually turned on the standard that the judge said he was bound by, that the judge said was precedent. Here is why: The 1996 case only mentioned the de minimus standard once. It was a passing reference. Even in that mention, the de minimus language is from a different circuit; it was from the Third  In that 1996 case that he claimed he was bound by and that my Republican colleagues keep mentioning that he was bound by, there is no discussion about whether the benefits provided to the high school student satisfied that standard. The case simply did not turn on the de minimus language. I know this seems in the weeds, but the court in 1996 never relied on the de minimus standard to reach the result that it did.  Was that enough? In the one passing mention in the 1996 case, which was not binding, the language actually says ``more than de minimus,'' but the judge went out of his way to add the word ``merely'' to that standard, which had never even been in the case that was not binding on him to begin with. So he changed it and said ``merely more than de minimus,'' that that is all the kind of education a kid with disabilities in that school district in Colorado would have to get. This is like if you say more than empty--the gas tank is more than empty, which means it could be a lot more than empty. Adding ``merely'' puts it closer to empty. You just say it is merely more than empty. The addition of a single word made it more difficult for children with disabilities to get help at school.  That is why it is hard for me to understand why the judge said that the ``merely more than de minimus'' standard was binding on him when he wrote that opinion in 2006. It was not. He added the word ``merely,'' and then he used a standard that did not even decide that 1996 case; that was from a different circuit.  When interpreting the IDEA, the judge once again went a step further instead of deciding the case on a narrow ground. That matters because decisions like this have a dramatic impact on the lives of children and families, which is exactly what Justice Roberts noted when he wrote the opinion 8-to-0 rejecting the standard that Judge Gorsuch had used.  I have heard from families in my State, and so many of them tell me how IDEA has made a real difference for them.  My mom taught second grade in the Minnesota Public Schools until she was 70 years old. I know from her how much she worked with those kids with disabilities and how much she cared about them.  Here is an example I just learned about from my A mom from Watertown, MN, told me about her son, who was born with Down syndrome. She is so thankful for IDEA because its protections ensures that he can have everyday life experiences. IDEA allows her son to be fully integrated with the rest of the students in his school. As a result, he has made many friends and built a strong social network. When she asks her son whether he likes school, he always says, in a resounding voice: Those are the stakes of this legal debate.  Second, I wanted to focus on campaign finance. In my view, one of the most troubling court decisions in recent years is Citizens Since Citizens United, dark money has been spent in extraordinary sums, adding up to an estimated $800 million in just the past 6 years. This continues to have an outsized influence on our politics, distorting our representative democracy and hurting, in my mind, campaigns on both sides of the aisle.[[Page S2357]]  How does this apply to the judge? It applies to the judge because of an opinion he wrote that is very relevant to this area of the law. That case, which is called Riddle v. Hickenlooper, is a narrow case about how campaign finance laws apply to certain kinds of contributions in Colorado, about if they are a major party or not major party.  The judge again decided that a narrow consensus decision was not enough. It was part of that decision, but then he went out of his way to write a separate concurring opinion to suggest that the court should, in fact, apply strict scrutiny to laws restricting campaign contributions. If the Supreme Court adopted the approach in the judge's opinion, it would compromise the few remaining campaign finance protections that are still on the books, and it would make it even more difficult for Congress to pass future reforms.  The notion that Congress has little or no role in setting reasonable campaign finance is in direct contradiction with where the American people are. In recent polls, over three-quarters of Americans have said that we need sweeping new laws to reduce the influence of money in politics. While polls may not be a judge's problem and should not be a judge's problem, democracy is. When unlimited, undisclosed money floods our campaigns, it drowns out the people's voices, and it undermines our elections and shakes the public's trust in the process.  My colleagues and I repeatedly asked the judge about his views on campaign finance laws and public disclosure requirements. He declined to tell us what the proper legal standard would be for evaluating campaign finance laws. He also would not give us a real sense of his views on public disclosure of campaign contributions, although a majority of current Justices support this.  During our exchange on campaign finance, I was reminded of Justice Scalia's support for greater public disclosure and his comments on that topic. Justice Scalia said:       Requiring people to stand up in public for their political      acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is      doomed. For my part, I do not look forward to a society      which, thanks to the Supreme Court, campaigns anonymously and      even exercises the direct democracy of initiative and      referendum hidden from public scrutiny and protected from the      accountability of criticism. This does not resemble the Home      of the  The most striking example of a judge choosing not to decide a case narrowly based on the facts was the one last year in which he wrote the opinion and then wrote a concurrence to his own opinion. As I noted at the Judiciary hearing, it is better to write a concurrence to your own opinion than write a dissent to our own opinion. But still he felt compelled to write a concurrence to what was an opinion that he wrote. Mostly, judges are happy when they get their peers to agree to a decision, but in this case, he went a step further.  In Gutierrez--the name of the case--the judge went beyond the facts to suggest overturning the long-established precedent of  Chevron is a 33-year-old Supreme Court case that ensures that the most complex regulatory decisions are made by the experts who are best equipped to handle them, not by judges or lawyers without any relevant technical knowledge.  Justice Scalia again embraced the Chevron doctrine, and it has been used in more than 13,500 decisions. Chevron ensures that Federal health, safety, and education rules stay on the books. These rules protect everyone, from the hard-earned pension of an hourly Minnesota grocery store worker, to the clean water in our Great Lakes, to the difference between life and death for Minnesota iron ore workers.  The judge's approach would have titanic, real-world implications on the daily lives of When the judge wrote an opinion that suggested it might be time to ``face the behemoth,'' he suggested a change in the law that would jeopardize countless rules, compromise important protections, and create widespread uncertainty in our laws.  I asked the judge about the uncertainty that would result from overturning I asked what he would replace it with. I didn't get a direct response. The judge even said that he ``didn't know what all the consequences would be'' and that he ``wasn't thinking about being a Supreme Court justice'' when he was writing the decision.  So what does all of this mean? It means that the judge has repeatedly gone beyond the facts of the case, issuing separate concurrences with far-reaching effects or, as in the disability decision, writing opinions with profound consequences.  When I read these opinions, I am reminded of Justice Byron White, who I know Judge Gorsuch clerked for and greatly admired. Justice White has been described by many as a Justice who was focused on deciding only the case in front of him. Here is a quote: ``Time and again, Justice White avoided broad, theoretical bases for a decision, when a narrow, fact-specific rationale would suffice.''  There is a reason we have judges to apply the law to the facts of a case. It is because answers aren't always as clear as we would like them to be, and sometimes there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the law. The cases that get to the Supreme Court are not the ones where everyone agreed at the lower court level. They are the really hard cases.  It is that discretion in making those decisions that makes it so critical that Justices interpret the law evenly, without fear or favor and with the humility to recognize the gravity of the office, to respect the role of the judiciary, and to understand the impact of their decisions on people's lives.  As I look back at the judge's record and his answers in the hearing, I am again reminded that it wasn't a law professor or a Federal jurist who was helped by a court's reliance on Chevron in interpreting a Labor Department rule. It was an hourly Minnesota grocery store worker who got to keep his hard-earned pension after the Eighth Circuit Court relied on  When the Supreme Court stripped away the rules in the Citizens United case that opened the door to unlimited super PAC spending, it was not the campaign financiers or the ad men who get paid to write these ads who were hurt. It was the grandma in Lanesboro, MN, who actually thought it mattered when she sent her Senator a $10 campaign contribution.  When Chief Justice Roberts wrote the unanimous opinion just this past month, rejecting the ``merely more than de minimis'' standard that Judge Gorsuch had used to limit the help kids with disabilities can get at school, the Justice said: ``When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing `merely more than de minimis' progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.'' That is what the Supreme Court said about how the standard that Judge Gorsuch wrote in his opinion in the Tenth Circuit affected students with disabilities.  In the end, I believe we need Justices who understand that the law is more than a set of dusty books in the basement stacks of a law library. It is the bedrock of our society. Above all, we need Justices who understand and will uphold the motto on the Supreme Court building, to ensure all Americans achieve ``Equal Justice Under Law.''  That is why I won't be supporting the judge's nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme  I yield the floor.

I have the honor of serving as the Republican chair of the House of Representatives Rare Disease I consider it one of the greatest responsibilities of my service to work for innovative treatment and new technologies and to build an atmosphere of appreciation and understanding in Congress for the hard work of all of the patient advocates. Their passion is often driven by the care of loved ones, and their personal stories are profiles in courage.  Hearing from thousands of advocates, many of whom are here in Washington this week, gives the members of the caucus renewed energy and purpose. Events held during Rare Disease Week here on Capitol Hill and at the NIH in Bethesda highlight what has been accomplished and what still needs to be done.  One of those champions joined us in the House Chamber just last evening. I was very proud that President Trump invited New Jersey resident Megan Crowley to his joint session address. Megan's story of combating a terrible rare disease is a testament to the American spirit. Megan is now a student at Notre I salute her, her parents, and her family for their courage.  Passage of the 21st Century Cures Act was a major accomplishment in the last Congress--indeed, in my opinion, it was the most important piece of legislation passed during the 114th We worked in a bicameral, bipartisan way. We worked with the White House and with the Department of Health and Human It passed overwhelmingly in the House and in the Senate, and now it is the law of the land.  I am encouraged that the Trump administration will carefully implement its provisions to our healthcare system, improving the healthcare system and to help spur the next great medical innovations.  Congress will join and help direct that effort and proceed through the appropriations process to match progress and research funds.                              {time}  1015  Right now it takes 15 years for a new drug to move from the lab to the local pharmacy. The CURES Act modernizes clinical trials to expedite the development of new drugs and devices, removes regulatory uncertainty in the development of new medical apps, and breaks down barriers to facilitate increased research collaboration.  Patients with degenerative conditions, cancers, and rare diseases await the genius of these new solutions. We need to do everything we can to help find these cures.  I have met with many rare disease patients, advocates, and their loved ones. Their work is inspiring, and it gives our caucus a mission and a purpose.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join the Rare Disease Caucus and help us in this great cause. In this, the week that we recognize the work of the tireless advocates across the Nation, I salute all of them for what they are doing for the American Nation.[[Page H1397]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1396-2.txt,1936,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,1.0,March

12328,topic-id,3544,"Mr.President, yesterday I spoke at length about my fear that Senator Sessions' would not have the ability to act as an independent Attorney The Attorney General is not the President's lawyer. He or she is the chief law enforcement officer of the United And he or she must faithfully serve all Even if Senator Sessions could demonstrate independence from President Trump, my review of his extensive record leaves me unconvinced that he is capable of serving and protecting all  In 1986, Senator Ted Kennedy called Jeff Sessions a ``throwback'' because of his conduct on civil rights issues. I regret to say that, since the Judiciary[[Page S938]]Committee's bipartisan rejection of Senator Sessions' nomination to be a district court judge in 1986, Senator Sessions has not allayed our concerns. In his 20 years in the Senate, he has not shown a commitment to protecting the most vulnerable in our communities. Time and again, when the rights of women, LGBT individuals, and disenfranchised communities have been debated here in the Senate, Senator Sessions has not sought to protect their civil and human rights. Too often, he has been the one standing in the way.  That is why National Nurses United has written to me to express their opposition to Senator They wrote: ``We provide the best care we possibly can, without regard to race, gender, national origin, religion, socio economic circumstances, or other identifying characteristic. That is what caring professionals do. Unfortunately, that is not what Jeff Sessions has done in his role as a public servant.'' I ask unanimous consent that their full letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. That is why my friend John Lewis testified before the Judiciary Committee in opposition to Senator Congressman Lewis stated that, ``When faced with a challenge, Senator Sessions has frequently chosen to stand on the wrong side of history.'' Senate Republicans should be listening to these concerns and those of protesters in our streets and airports standing up for our We should not subject those concerns to a gag rule.  Yet Senator Sessions and his supporters have painted a different picture of his record. They have argued that he has a strong record on civil rights. So I asked Senator Sessions in written questions to identify areas in which racial inequalities persist. He could have talked about sentencing or about areas where the Civil Rights Division has found patterns and practices of police departments violating people's rights or about the kind of voter suppression efforts that an appeals court found ``target[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' Senator Sessions did not identify a single example of racial inequality in modern That is astonishing. No one can uphold the rights of all Americans if he is unwilling to pay attention when those rights are being violated.  Some have suggested that Senator Sessions' record on civil rights has been criticized unfairly and he is held to a different standard because he is a conservative from the I disagree. When the Judiciary Committee rejected Senator Sessions' district court nomination in 1986, one of the votes against him came from Senator Heflin, who was a conservative from Moreover, I and most other Democrats just voted to confirm as U.Ambassador another conservative Southerner: Nikki In 2015, then-Governor Haley made the decision to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds. She said, ``[I]t should never have been there'' and that she ``couldn't look my children in the face and justify it staying there.'' When Senator Sessions was asked about this and other efforts to remove the Confederate flag from public buildings, he argued that such efforts ``seek to delegitimize the fabulous accomplishments of our country.'' It can come as no surprise that the civil rights community is concerned by his nomination.  But I will speak to my own experiences with Senator Sessions' views on civil rights laws. In 2009, Senator Sessions opposed expanding hate crime protections to women and LGBT individuals, groups that have historically been targeted based merely on who they are. He stated, ``I am not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just don't see it.'' Thankfully, a bipartisan majority of Senators saw it, and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crimes Prevention Act is now law. These protections are needed now more than ever. According to recent FBI statistics, LGBT individuals are more likely to be targeted for hate crimes than any other minority group in the country.  Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, wrote a letter last month opposing Senator Sessions' nomination. She was concerned not just by Senator Sessions' opposition to the law that bears her son's name, but by how Senator Sessions viewed such hate crimes. She wrote:       ``Senator Sessions strongly opposed the hate crimes bill--     characterizing hate crimes as mere `thought crimes.'      Unfortunately, Senator Sessions believes that hate crimps      are, what he describes as, mere `thought crimes.'       ``My son was not killed by 'thoughts' or because his      murderers said hateful things. My son was brutally beaten      with the butt of a .357 magnum pistol, tied him to a fence,      and left him to die in freezing temperatures because he was      gay. Senator Sessions' repeated efforts to diminish the life-     changing acts of violence covered by the Hate Crimes      Prevention Act horrified me then, as a parent who knows the      true cost of hate, and it terrifies me today to see that this      same person is now being nominated as the country's highest      authority to represent justice and equal protection under the      law for all Americans.''  But that was not all. Senator Sessions also said that ``the hate crimes amendment . . . has been said to cheapen the civil rights movement.'' I asked him about this comment and whether he still felt that way at his hearing, but he did not respond to the question. I asked him a second time, in a written follow-up, what he meant by that comment. He replied that ``Those were not my words,'' but again did not explain what he had meant by that remark. So I asked him a third time. The third time, he finally conceded. He wrote to me that ``it is not correct to say it cheapens our commitment to civil rights.'' If it is not correct to say that, then why did Senator Sessions quote it in the first place--and why did it take him three tries to acknowledge the error?  Senator Sessions also opposed the 2013 Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which overwhelmingly passed the Senate with support from a majority of Republican During his hearing, and again in written questions, Senator Sessions refused to commit to defend this important law's constitutionality. He said only that he ``will carefully study'' it to discern whether it is ``reasonably defensible.'' His refusal to voice support for VAWA is all the more troubling in light of reports that the Heritage Foundation's budget blueprint, which is reportedly being relied on by the new administration, calls for eliminating all VAWA grants. I asked Senator Sessions to commit to stand up for victims and preserve these critical programs. Again, he refused.  Amita Swadhin, who appeared before the Judiciary Committee and bravely shared her story of being raped as a child, explained why this issue is so important: ``We need an Attorney General who will continue the progress we have made since the initial passage of VAWA, someone committed to improving and enforcing our laws to ensure the most vulnerable victims of crime can come forward to seek accountability and to access healing.'' This law and these grants are a matter of life and death to many people across the country. We need an Attorney General who understands that. The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, which has never before taken a position on an Attorney General nomination, wrote to the Judiciary Committee because they do not believe Senator Sessions understands that. The letter states:       ``Senator Sessions' senate record of strenuous objection to      protections for historically marginalized populations,      coupled with his record of selective prosecutions,      demonstrate his unwillingness to protect marginalized      victims' access to justice and disqualify him from holding      the position of Attorney General of the United States, a      position charged with the responsibility of securing justice      for all.''  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Senator Sessions and his supporters have tried to minimize his opposition to the Leahy-Crapo VAWA bill by pointing out that he did vote in committee for the Republican substitute amendment. Let me explain what that amendment would have done. It would have cut authorization levels by 40 percent, hampering efforts to prevent violence and provide services to victims in need. It would have removed all provisions intended to ensure that victims can receive services, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. It would have removed important provisions to let tribal justice systems reach the many criminal and civil cases that fell through the cracks. That amendment would have gutted core elements[[Page S939]]of the VAWA reauthorization that go to the heart of what VAWA does. A vote for that amendment hardly demonstrates a commitment to victims.  Another issue that concerns me is criminal justice reform. For years, I have worked with a bipartisan group of Senators to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. These sentences have created perverse disparities within our justice system. Racial minorities still receive nearly 80 percent of them. Our bipartisan effort has had the strong support of the Justice Department and many others in law enforcement, but not Senator In recent years, no one in the Senate has fought harder against even modest sentencing reform than he has.  I am also concerned about Senator Sessions' commitment to ongoing civil rights litigation. I asked whether he would maintain the Justice Department's position in certain important cases. He would not commit to maintaining the Department's position, even in voting rights cases where courts have already found that certain voter ID laws are discriminatory.  Senator Sessions would not commit to even maintaining cases that are already at the Supreme Last month, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in Endrew v. Douglas County School The Justice Department filed an amicus brief in support of the petitioner, arguing that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires states to provide more than de minimis educational benefits and in fact ``give eligible children with disabilities an opportunity to make significant educational progress.'' Even though it would be extraordinary for the Justice Department to take a new position after oral argument has already been heard, Senator Sessions would not commit to maintaining the Department's position in this case.  I pointed to a lawsuit the Justice Department filed last year in Georgia alleging that Georgia's treatment of students with disabilities violated the Americans with Disabilities In this lawsuit, the Justice Department noted that some of the facilities used by students with disabilities ``are located in poor-quality buildings that formerly served as schools for black students during de jure segregation.'' I asked Senator Sessions whether he would continue to pursue this case, and bring others like it where States are in violation of the He refused to commit to continuing this case. The ADA also contains a waiver of State sovereign immunity, which is a critical tool for enforcing that landmark law. Twice during the Bush administration, the Justice Department argued, and the Supreme Court agreed, that the waiver was a valid exercise of Congressional power under section V of the 14th Amendment, but Senator Sessions would not commit to defending the constitutionality of that provision.  Senator Sessions' record on disability rights is also of concern because of the way he spoke about students with disabilities. He once argued that mainstreaming causes a ``decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all over America.'' As with my hate crimes amendment and VAWA, the problem is not just that Senator Sessions has opposed protections for the most vulnerable, it is also the language that he uses when opposing them, which denigrate those the laws seek to protect. That is why a group of 18 disability rights organizations have written to Senate leadership expressing their strong opposition to Senator Sessions' nomination.  Senator Sessions has also demonstrated a shockingly brazen attitude when I asked him about the offensive rhetoric used by some of his political associates. I asked him whether he would condemn certain remarks by David Horowitz, Frank Gaffney, and others. Senator Sessions received awards from these individuals. He regularly attended their conferences. He has given media statements in support of their organizations and the views they put forth. Yet, when Senator Sessions was directly asked to respond to some of their statements, he effectively shrugged his shoulders. These included comments: referring to Muslims as ``Islamic Nazis'' who ``want to kill Jews, that's their agenda''; alleging that President Obama ``is an anti-American radical and I'm actually sure he's a Muslim, he certainly isn't a . . . He's a pretend Christian in the same way he's a pretend American''; alleging that two Muslims members of Congress have ``longstanding Muslim Brotherhood ties''; arguing that a Muslim member of Congress should not be allowed to serve on the House Intelligence Committee because of his ``extensive personal and political associations with . . . jihadist infrastructure in America''; claiming that married women by definition cannot be raped by their husbands; calling for ``railroad cars full of illegals going south; and calling President Obama a traitor.  Senator Sessions responded that he does not hold those views. That is fair enough. But he did not explain why he chose to associate with such individuals. When someone accuses President Obama of treason, it is not at all enough to say, ``I do not hold that view.'' That is why, last month, Muslim advocates and 36 other civil rights organizations, including the Leadership Conference on Civic and Human Rights and the NAACP, wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee expressing strong concern that ``Senator Sessions has closely aligned with anti-Muslim hate groups, accepted their awards and accolades, and publicly praised their leadership. Senator Sessions' appointment will only embolden these groups and activists and serve to further fan the flames of anti-Muslim bigotry already burning in this country.'' If Senator Sessions cannot condemn David Horowitz and Frank Gaffney, who the Southern Poverty Law Center has repeatedly called ``extremists'' who run hate groups, for calling President Obama a traitor, it is fair to ask whether he will have the courage to stand up to the President of the United States, as Sally Yates did.  The Attorney General is charged with enforcing the laws that protect all No one can fulfill that obligation who is not clear-eyed about the threats facing the most vulnerable in our communities. We need an Attorney General who will aggressively confront those who appeal to hate and fear. I do not believe that person is Senator The Senate and the Judiciary Committee have heard from a multitude of civil rights, civil liberties, and domestic violence organizations, as well as nurses and numerous faith leaders, who oppose this nomination. This Senator stands with them.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       National Nurses United,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.     Patrick Leahy,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senator Leahy: We write on behalf of the more than      150,000 registered nurse members of National Nurses United to      urge you to vote against the confirmation of Senator Jeff      Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Attorney      Much has been said by many others against      confirmation of this nominee, so we will be brief.       Our members work as bedside healthcare professionals in      almost every state in the nation. We work in every hospital      setting, from small rural facilities to large urban public      health systems, in prominent research hospitals affiliated      with prestigious public and private universities, as well as      Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. We care for Americans      on every point of the demographic spectrum, at their most      vulnerable. We provide the best care we possibly can, without      regard to race, gender, national origin, religion, socio      economic circumstances, or other identifying characteristic.      That is what caring professionals do. Unfortunately, that is      not what Jeff Sessions has done in his role as a public      servant. And to vote in favor of confirming him as the chief      law enforcement officer of the United States would abdicate      your responsibility to provide the oversight necessary to      ensure that basic legal rights are enforced evenhandedly and      for the protection of all people.       As Senate colleagues, you no doubt know Senator Sessions'      record as a lawmaker, as well as his record as the U.     Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as the      Alabama Attorney It was, of course, his record in      the U.Attorney's office and his many publically verified      racially insensitive comments that resulted in a majority of      the Senate Judiciary Committee voting against confirmation      for his nomination to be a U.District Court judge in 1986.      This `no' vote happened while the Judiciary Committee was      majority Even Senator Howell Heflin, a fellow      Alabamian, voted against him, citing ``reasonable doubts''      over whether he could be ``fair and impartial.''       Senator Sessions has oft asserted that his comments over      the years were taken out of context, or intended as humor.      But his record tells the truth. Early in his career he[[Page S940]]     charged civil right leaders (``the Marion Three'') with      voting fraud related to their efforts to assist African      American voters. The fact that the defendants in that case      were acquitted didn't deter Mr.Later, as Attorney      General of Alabama, he initiated another voter fraud      investigation involving absentee ballots cast by black voters      that, again, resulted in findings of no wrong doing. During      that same timeframe, he was criticized for declining to      investigate church burnings, and he ``joked'' that he thought      Ku Klux Klan members were ``OK, until [he] learned that they      smoked marijuana.''       Against that background, Senator Sessions aggressively      interrogated Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court's first      nominee of Latino heritage. Further betraying a deep belief      in natural division between racial groups, he grilled Justice      Sotomayor about whether she could be fair to white Americans,      despite her 17-year record as a jurist and having received      the American Bar Association's highest rating. And he      expressed grave concerns that she would engage in judicial      ``empathy'' on the high court, favoring persons of certain      races or ethnicities over others. He then voted against her      confirmation.       Senator Sessions' prejudices are not only against people of      color. As an organization representing a predominately female      profession we are compelled to express our outrage that      Senator Sessions defended Donald Trump's statements about      grabbing women by the genitals, by saying that such conduct      would not constitute sexual assault. The fact that he took a      different position during his Committee hearing is of no      comfort. It only shows that he will say whatever he believes      will help land him in the seat of power to determine whether,      and against whom, to enforce our laws. His comments last fall      dismissing President-elect Trump's despicable treatment of      women is consistent with his vote in 2013 against the      Violence Against Women As nurses, we see close up the      devastating effects of domestic violence against our      patients, and we are disturbed by Senator Sessions' alleged      concern that the protection of that statute should not extend      to victims of violence on tribal lands.       Moreover, confirming Senator Sessions to the job of the top      prosecutor would exacerbate our national crisis over race      issues in policing and our criminal justice system. He      personally blocked the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act,      a bipartisan effort spearheaded by Charles Grassley (R-     Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and John Cornyn (R-Texas), and      Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The fact that law      enforcement leadership throughout the nation supported the      reform effort made no difference to Senator And      unfortunately, his actions as U.Attorney for the Southern      District of Alabama only further illustrate his indifference      to this crisis. For example, drug convictions made up 40      percent of his cases when he served in that position--twice      the rate of other federal prosecutors in       Despite the current trend of focusing resources on violent      crime, and away from out-dated drug war policies, Senator      Sessions continues to oppose any attempts to legalize      marijuana and any reduction in drug sentences. As Attorney      General, he could direct federal prosecutors throughout the      country to pursue the harshest penalties possible for even      low-level drug offenses, a step that would further exacerbate      our national record of incarcerating non-violent offenders--     the vast majority of whom could be successfully treated, at      far lower cost to society, with appropriate healthcare      treatment.       Nor should Senator Sessions be trusted to ensure equal      access to voting rights. He has publically called the Voting      Rights Act ``intrusive,'' and has insisted that its proactive      protections of racial minorities were no longer necessary.      This is especially disturbing as Senator Sessions voiced      public support for voter-ID laws, while his home state      recently tried to close over thirty DMV offices, many in      majority-black areas, shortly after instituting strict voter-     ID requirements. We are reminded of the words of Coretta      Scott King in her letter opposing Jeff Sessions' nomination      to the federal district court in 1986: ``The irony of ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS873-2.txt,1383,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,6.0,February

12332,topic-id,1868,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in support of the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United  I enthusiastically support this nomination, because I know Senator Sessions to be an independent-minded man of great integrity. He is someone who understands and respects the rule of law. He values it deeply, in fact. He is someone who understands the difference between making law and enforcing the law. He understands the difference between setting policy and enforcing laws that contain policy, and he is someone who understands that, as a lawyer, the very best way to serve your client often involves offering honest, independent advice--honest independent advice of the sort that might not always occur to the client on the client's part.  I have listened to the remarks of some of my colleagues, and I have to state that I have served with Senator Sessions for the last 6 years, ever since I first became a Member of this body, and I don't recognize the caricature that has been painted of him over the last 24 hours. So I want to address head-on several of my colleagues' expressed concerns about his nomination.  Some of my colleagues have expressed and relied upon what really amount to policy concerns--policy disagreements between themselves and Senator Sessions--as a reason to oppose his nomination.  As I explained it in our Judiciary Committee markup last week, I have disagreed with Senator Sessions not just 1 or 2 times but on many, many occasions and not just on a few isolated issues that are only tangentially related to something important to me but on circumstances and issues that are very important to me and that are at the center of my legislative agenda. We have disagreed, for example, about sentencing reform. We have disagreed about immigration reform, and several important national security issues implicating constitutional law, and constitutional policy. All of these issues are very important to both of us--to me and to Senator They can be emotional issues, and they happen to be issues on which Senator Sessions and I disagree, not just a little bit, but we happen to disagree taking almost diametrically opposed positions in many of these areas.  Notwithstanding these disagreements--disagreements that I have seen in every one of the 6 years I have served in this body so far--I have never seen Senator Sessions raise his voice in anger against a colleague. To be sure, Senator Sessions makes his arguments vigorously, passionately, and forcefully, and yet he does so in a way that ensures that he will always treat his colleagues, even though he disagrees with them, with dignity and respect. You may not persuade him that your position is right and his is wrong, but he always gives you the opportunity to make your case. I think Members of this body know that. Those Members of this body who have actually taken the time to get to know Senator Sessions and actually have the opportunity to work with him, even the opportunity to disagree with him know that. Senator Sessions interacts with his colleagues in a way that demonstrates a degree of respect for differences of opinion that are seldom seen here. In fact, I can't think of a colleague who better exemplifies the principles of collegiality to which we aspire in this body than does Senator  Perhaps even more importantly, Senator Sessions obviously understands the difference between lawmaking on the one hand and law enforcement on the other hand. This is plain from testimony he provided before the Judiciary  As just one example, he told us:       To go from the Legislative branch to the Executive branch      is a transfer not only of position, but of the way you      approach issues. I would be in an executive function and      enforcement function of the law this great legislative body      might pass.''  His commitment to the rule of law and even application of the law is also plain from his public record, from his record serving in other positions. His record, for example, as U.Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, and his record as attorney general for the State of  To put the matter quite plainly, a great number of Senators have served in the Cabinet over the years. The standard has never been that a Senator is somehow unfit for the executive branch--for a Cabinet position in the executive branch--if he or she has disagreed with you on important issues. If that were the standard, no Senator would ever be confirmed because we debate important public policy issues[[Page S943]]every single day, and it is never the case that we will find any among us, even colleagues, with whom we agree most of the time who are going to agree with us 100 percent of the time. So I urge my colleagues to put aside any policy differences they might have with Senator Sessions when considering his nomination and when deciding how they are going to vote in response to his nomination, because those simply are not relevant to his job and, at a minimum, ought not to be disqualifying factors relevant to his job.  As to independence, some of my colleagues doubt that Senator Sessions will be an independent voice at the Department of Respectfully, I can say with full confidence that anyone who actually knows Senator Sessions knows that he is fiercely independent-minded. He never shies away from expressing his closely held, sincerely developed views on any issue, even when political pressure might suggest a different course of action be in order. It is clear that Sessions will apply his independent-mindedness to his job after he is confirmed as Attorney General of the United  During his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, he repeatedly outlined the importance of having an independent Attorney General, and he explained how he would fulfill this obligation, how he would become precisely such an Attorney General, one who would exercise a degree of independence and not simply be a rubber stamp.  For example, he told us that every Attorney General ``understands, I think, that if a President wants to accomplish a goal that he or she believes in deeply, you should help them do it in a lawful way but make clear and object if it is an unlawful action.'' He described that role--being able to tell the President ``no,'' that is--as ``the ultimate loyalty to him.''  He testified: ``I hope that President Trump has confidence in me so that if I give him advice that something can be done or cannot be done, that he would respect that.''  Sessions also explained that if the Attorney General were asked ``to do something plainly unlawful, he cannot participate in that. He or she would have to resign ultimately before agreeing to execute a policy that the Attorney General believed would be unlawful or unconstitutional.'' Senator Sessions made this point repeatedly. He made it with great emphasis and in such a way that it is unmistakably clear to me that this is the Attorney General he would aspire to be and that he would in fact become after being confirmed.  Now, some may argue that you cannot necessarily trust his testimony because no Attorney General nominee would declare an intention to be a rubberstamp to the nominated Others may argue that Senator Sessions was too involved in the Trump campaign to be impartial. This is one of those points that you either believe or don't believe. You can't reason your way to an answer. You have to know the person.  So I urge my colleagues to reflect on their experiences with Senator If I know one thing about him, he is not a ``yes'' man. If I know one thing about him, it is that of all the people with whom I have served in the Senate, he is one of the very last who I would ever expect in any context to sell out his sincerely held views on the basis of political expediency. Instead, Senator Sessions takes his professional responsibility very seriously.  When he was a lawyer, he took seriously his obligations to his client and the law. As a Senator, he has taken seriously his obligations to the people of the State of I know he will do the same thing at the U.Department of  He told us that ``the Attorney General ultimately owes his loyalty to the integrity of the American people and to the fidelity of the Constitution, and the legislative laws of the country.'' This demonstrates that Senator Sessions understands, as any good lawyer does, that every lawyer has a client, and you understand how best to represent that client and that client's interest. You have to understand the nature of the attorney-client relationship. You have to know who the client is, you have to know how to interact with that client, and you have to be willing to push back on that client, even when--especially when--it is difficult, because that is the job of the lawyer. The obligations incumbent upon the lawyer provides that the lawyer sometimes has to push back on the client.  At the end of the day, it seems to me that some of my colleagues perhaps just want an Attorney General who will be openly, affirmatively, presumptively, perennially hostile to the President's agenda. Now, that has never been the standard, and it is not a workable way of arranging the executive branch of the U.The President should be allowed to assemble his or her team so long as the President picks people who are qualified, people who are willing and able to fulfill their constitutional responsibility, and people who do not have anything disqualifying in their backgrounds that would suggest that they cannot be trusted with this type of very substantial responsibility. Senator Sessions plainly satisfies these criteria.  So I support Senator Sessions' nomination. I do so wholeheartedly. I do so, I would add, with a somewhat heavy heart, knowing that as we take this step and confirm Senator Sessions as the next Attorney General of the United States, we will be losing a colleague--not just any colleague but a colleague that has been a dear friend to me, who has been a kind mentor and a good example to me at every stage of my service in the He has done this not only when we have agreed, but he has done this especially when we have disagreed. That is what I love so much about Senator Sessions--that he has taught me much about how to get along with and respect people who sometimes reach different conclusions than I reach on my own.

12327,topic-id,1122,"Mr.President, I have heard from literally thousands of my constituents who have contacted my office in unprecedented numbers with[[Page S937]]fears about a Justice Department headed by Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of the United  My constituents and Americans all across the country are concerned about the independence and integrity of the Justice Department under President Donald  We are only 3 weeks into the Trump administration, and what we have seen so far has been alarming. We have 3 years and 49 weeks left to go in President Trump's term of office, and we have already seen in 3 weeks President Trump issue an illegal and immoral ban on Muslim refugees. We then saw President Trump fire Acting Attorney General Sally Yates from her job overseeing the Department of Justice--an action reminiscent of Watergate's infamous ``Saturday Night Massacre''--because she refused to defend in court his unconstitutional and un-American Executive order.  Sally Yates's job and the job of the entire Justice Department is to uphold the rule of law. The Attorney General of the United States is the lawyer for the people of the United States--not Donald Trump's personal lawyer. It is called the rule of law, not the rule of Trump, but it is the rule of law that is at stake when the nomination of Senator Sessions is in question to run the Department of  I have told my constituents that Senator Sessions must be judged based on the totality of his record: as a U.attorney, as Alabama's attorney general, and as U. A review of that record, including 2 days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, demonstrates anything but the commitment to the equal and impartial administration of justice and an independence from the President that we must demand from the Nation's top law enforcement officer.  Senator Sessions' record spanning decades in public office reflects hostility to important constitutional rights, hostility to laws intended to protect people of color, hostility to laws intended to protect women, hostility to laws intended to protect the LGBTQ community, and hostility to laws intended to protect immigrants against discrimination and violence.  Senator Sessions has fought against civil rights efforts. He has fought against protecting voting rights, and as a U.attorney, Sessions tried to prosecute three civil rights workers who were helping elderly and disabled African-American voters to cast absentee ballots.  During his 1986 judicial nomination hearing, he called the Voting Rights Act ``an intrusive piece of legislation.'' And in his testimony to the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions would not commit to continue the Justice Department's efforts to challenge restrictive State voter ID laws. Senator Sessions has fought against comprehensive immigration reform, against criminal justice reform, and against commonsense gun control measures.  As for a woman's right to choose, Senator Sessions has said: ``I firmly believe that Roe v. Wade and its descendants represent one of the worst, colossally erroneous Supreme Court decisions of all time.'' At his confirmation hearing, Senator Feinstein pressed him on his statement, asking him whether it was still his view. ``It is,'' Senator Sessions replied.  It is simply unimaginable that we would have an Attorney General of the United States holding such a view of Roe v. Wade and the rights of women to control their own reproductive health. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and it should remain that way forever.  Mr.President, I would also like to address the actions last night by the Senate majority leader to silence the remarks of my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Elizabeth  Coretta Scott King was attending the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston when she met a divinity doctoral student at Boston University in 1952, in One year later, Coretta Scott married Martin Luther King, Jr., as they took their degrees from Boston to begin a cause found in the South that became a national and international movement.

Leader McConnell used an arcane Senate rule to silence Senator Warren, but the people of Massachusetts and all people of good conscience will never be silenced when confronted with our moral responsibility to speak out.  Senator Warren deserves an apology for being silenced when she attempted to share this very relevant, very powerful part of our national history last night. The American people deserve to hear the important words of Coretta Scott So here they are:       Dear Senator Thurmond:       I write to express my sincere opposition to the      confirmation of Jefferson Sessions as a federal district      court judge for the Southern District of My      professional and personal roots in Alabama are deep and      lasting. Anyone who has used the power of his office as      United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free      exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to      our courts. Mr.Sessions has used the awesome powers of his      office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly      black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not      be rewarded with a federal judgeship.       I regret that a long-standing commitment prevents me from      appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However,      I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr.Sessions'      confirmation and I request that my statement as well as this      letter be made a part of the hearing record.       I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS873-2.txt,735,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,6.0,February

12271,topic-id,6425,"Mr.President, I am rising to speak this morning about the nomination of our colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama, to become the 84th Attorney General of the United As the highest law enforcement officer in the land, it is the responsibility of the Attorney General to ensure that all Americans receive the equal justice under the law they are entitled to as American citizens.  A commitment to that equal justice has rarely been more necessary than it is today. We need an Attorney General wholly committed to serving the people of the Nation, and we need an Attorney General who fights to expand American's civil rights, not to restrict them, hobble them, or eliminate them, or to eliminate the Justice Department's Office of Civil  We need an Attorney General who will stand up to the President when he tries to put an illegal and unconstitutional policy in place. So it has been part of our journey, the story of America, that we have strived to form a more perfect union. We have worked over time--like Martin Luther King said, the long arc of history bends toward justice.  But we have worked to bend toward justice. Our vision of opportunity was incomplete at the founding of our It was not extended to all genders and all ethnicities and all races. We have worked hard to change that, but here we are at this point in time, still not at the end of that journey.  Part of the question is, How does any given individual fit into the position of Attorney General in that fight for that more perfect vision of our Nation?  So I thought I would share a little bit about that. Hillary Shelton, the Director of NAACP's Washington office, told the New Republic that Senator Sessions has ``consistently opposed the bread and butter civil rights agenda.'' When the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 2013 with Shelby v. Holder, Senator Sessions celebrated the decision saying: If you go to Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, people are not denied a vote because of the color of their skin.  Well, indeed, part of this--the point is, when the Voting Rights Act was in place, it prevented many activities that would have otherwise denied the vote. We have seen the resurgence of all kinds of measures since the Voting Rights Act was modified by the Supreme Court, which it eliminated key provisions.  We have seen the ``almost surgical precision'' of North Carolina's voter ID law that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down because they were created specifically to reduce the vote of African We are living in times that it just feels like our Nation is a bit under siege.  During the campaign of last year, we had so many divisive attacks as part of the Presidential primaries. Even during the general election, very divisive rhetoric passed from the man who would then become our President, President Trump--attacks on women, attacks on minorities, attacks on African Americans, attacks on Hispanics, attacks on people with disabilities.  Yet, against that, we have a vision of a system of law that treats everyone equally, impartially. We learned when we were children that Lady Liberty wears a blindfold with the scales of justice in her hand. We need an Attorney General who has at their core that vision of impartial justice, justice for every American, justice regardless of skin color, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of geography. That is essential, and we need it now particularly in a powerful way to help address the divisive rhetoric of the last year, which has left many people doubting that their government is willing to fight for them, that they will receive this form of impartial justice.  We have seen what has happened with the strong work of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President For more than half a century, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division fought for and enforced laws that uphold the basic rights of all Americans, steadily expanding opportunities.  The work of that division was stifled, restricted in many ways during George Bush's administration. But under President Obama, the Civil Rights Division has worked hard to apply, in a powerful way, civil rights for all In just the last few weeks of the Obama administration, they won the first hate crime case involving a transgender victim, they sued two cities that were blocking mosques from opening, they settled lending discrimination charges with two banks and sued a third, they filed legal briefs on behalf of New York teenagers held in solitary confinement, and they accused a business in Louisiana of moving mental patients into nursing homes. They were actively, aggressively fighting for the rights of all  Many wonder now, under the new administration, whether we will have a powerful Civil Rights Division fighting for those whom others would choose to exploit. Senator Sessions has downplayed the need for the Justice Department to prosecute crimes against women and members of the LGBTQ community, saying: I am not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face discrimination. I just don't see it, he said.  Well, if you talk to LGBTQ Americans, they will tell you their stories of harassment and discrimination. So it is very hard not to be aware of the extraordinary amount of discrimination they experience, unless you are determined not to see it. To those who say we don't see discrimination, if you ask, you will hear the stories of discrimination. You will hear the stories of profiling, individual young African-American men picked out time and time again to be stopped and questioned at a rate that someone of a different skin color would not experience, but you do not see it unless you open your eyes to see it. At his confirmation hearing, Senator Sessions said: These lawsuits undermine respect for police officers. He was referring to the investigation of two dozen police agencies, knowing that the Civil Rights Division reached consent decrees with 14 of them.  He said: These lawsuits undermine the respect of police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness. Well, let me explain that the reason the departments were investigated is because there were a lot of reports that in fact they were not doing their work consistent with fidelity to the law. It was not an impression; it was a report about failure to do that.  Don't we want an Attorney General who rather than relegating the complaint to, well, don't pursue them because it creates an impression they are[[Page S887]]not doing work, instead says: These are complaints we must investigate and remedy that situation. That is the responsibility of the Civil Rights Division, to investigate and to remedy, and that is what this division did under President They didn't turn a blind eye. They didn't say that would be embarrassing to the Department, but my colleague had a different take, saying: We need to be careful before we do that because it might create an impression that they are not doing their work well. Just think if we take that attitude.  We anticipate to have hearings for a labor commissioner. The nominee for Labor runs a company that has a tremendous number of Hardee's and Carl's outlets, and those outlets have a horrendous record of labor rights abuses, but we wouldn't know about those abuses if the investigator said: We won't investigate because it might create an impression that they are doing something wrong.  So I am very concerned about the attitude that you don't investigate because you might embarrass someone.  When there are reports of injustice, that is the point, that it gets investigated. And it not only gets investigated in order that the problems will get remedied but also so it will send a message to others to operate within the bounds of the law.  Our next Attorney General needs to make civil rights a priority, fighting for them, ensuring them, securing them as the North Star of the Justice Department--not something that can simply be left to the States, not something that can be ignored, not something that will be allowed to slip backward.  Communities of color aren't the only ones watching Senator Sessions' confirmation process with some anxiety. Over the last 8 years, the rights of the LGBTQ community have leapt forward in incredible ways, from the greater acceptance of gay and lesbian Americans and transgender And certainly we cannot forget the historic milestone of the legalization of same-sex marriage a year and a half ago. But so many of these long-fought-for and hard-won rights are so new that the community is terrified that President Trump's administration will work to restrict those rights or roll those rights back. But it is the duty of the Attorney General to protect those rights, to fight for those rights.  So it is of some concern--for me, it is a substantial concern--that the nominee voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crimes Prevention This act was passed on October 22, 2009, and signed by President Obama 6 days later. It was part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, and it expands the 1969 U.Federal hate crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  The bill removes the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity, like voting or going to schools. It is much, much broader. It gives Federal authorities a greater ability to engage in hate crimes investigations that local authorities choose not to pursue.  It provided funding for fiscal years 2010 to 2012 to help State and local agencies pay for investigations and prosecuting hate crimes.  It requires the FBI--the Federal Bureau of Investigation--to track statistics of hate crimes based on gender and gender identity. Hate crimes for other groups were already being tracked.  It was named after Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, In 1998, Matthew Shepard, a student, was tied to a fence, tortured, and left to die in Laramie, WY, because of his sexuality. In that same year, James Byrd, an African-American man, was tied to a truck by two White supremacists. He was dragged behind it and was decapitated in Jasper, At the time, Wyoming hate crime laws did not recognize homosexuals as a subset class, and Texas had no hate crimes laws at all.  Supporters of an expansion in hate crimes laws argue that hate crimes are worse than regular crimes without a prejudice motivation from a psychological perspective. The time it takes to mentally recover from a hate crime is almost twice as long as it is for a regular crime. And LGBTQ people feel as if they are being punished for their sexuality, which leads to a higher incidence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.  In short, in multiple ways, in ways I have enumerated, this law more aggressively pursued justice. I was pleased to be here as a first-year Senator to be able to support that law. Hate crimes tear at our collective spirit. They are based on divisions in our society, divisions that some choose to amplify and inflame, divisions that victimize people for being who they are as individuals.  I was proud of this Chamber, of this Senate, that we passed a bill that would give State and local law enforcement the necessary tools to prevent and prosecute these types of crimes and move our Nation down a path toward equality--equality under the law and freedom from persecution. But my colleague, the nominee, voted against this pursuit of greater justice for a persecuted group within our society, and that certainly bothers me substantially. It is my understanding that he didn't feel that people actually faced discrimination, but the fact is, they do.  LGBTQ individuals, especially transgender women of color, are more likely than any other group to be targets of discrimination and hate crimes. Across the category, and more so in some, look at the 49 people killed, the 53 more injured at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last summer. The attacker purposely targeted a gay nightclub for his attack. LGBTQ people are twice as likely as African Americans to be targets of hate crimes. Nearly one-fifth of the 5,462 so-called single-bias hate crimes reported to the FBI in 2014 were because of the person's sexuality or perceived orientation.  Another issue was raised in 2010 when the proposal was put forward to repeal a discriminatory law in the military, the don't ask, don't tell law, which barred openly gay and lesbian individuals from serving in our armed services. My colleague, our nominee, said that gay servicemembers would have a corrosive effect on morale, essentially saying discrimination is justified because of the prejudices of others who serve. But it is not justified, and the prejudices have taken a bit of movement along that journey toward justice.  More than 14,500 people were discharged from the military during the 18 years of don't ask, don't tell. An estimated 66,000 lesbian, gay, and bisexual servicemembers were in the military at the time the ban was lifted. But here is what happened after that 2010 change--a change that our nominee opposed. The military family embraced the LGBTQ community, and instead of having a corrosive effect, repealing don't ask, don't tell has strengthened the military family. In fact, in 2016, just last year, the first openly gay Army Secretary was confirmed, Eric Last year, the Navy named a ship after Harvey Milk, the gay politician and former member of the Navy who was assassinated in 1978.  So a robust pursuit of equality would have been to voice principled opposition to this discrimination in armed services that was actually robbing our armed services of a tremendous amount of talent and experience and was damaging the lives of those who were expelled from the military. That would have been a principled pursuit of justice, but that is not the path my colleague, our nominee, chose to travel. Instead, it was a path of justifying discrimination, justifying injustice.  During the confirmation hearing, my colleague, our nominee, softened his stance on LGBTQ issues, and he said he would uphold the statute protecting LGBT people's safety and ensure that the community's civil rights are enforced. Well, I wish we had more statutes that protected LGBT people's safety. Promising to uphold them when they largely don't exist is somewhat of an empty promise. It sounds good, but it lacks punch.  We had a debate in this Chamber about the Employment Non-Discrimination This act was specifically about anti-discrimination in the process of job hiring in America, and I was deeply involved in this effort.  Back in Oregon, when I became speaker, I worked to end discrimination for our LGBT community--discrimination in hiring, discrimination in public accommodations, discrimination on a whole spectrum of aspects of our society. And we passed a very strong law in the State of Oregon to end that discrimination, and a piece of[[Page S888]]it--a big piece of it--was to end employment discrimination. How can we claim, as a nation, that we are the land of opportunity if we slam shut the door to opportunity on a large number of our fellow Americans by allowing discrimination in employment?  Well, because of that work I did in Oregon--when I came here to the Senate, Senator Kennedy was ill. Senator Kennedy would champion this legislation. Senator Kennedy, who had been here--he had been on the floor, I believe it was 1998 or 1996. And that bill had only failed by one vote back before the turn of the century. It was a 50-to-49 vote. The individual who was not here probably have voted for it. The Vice President breaking a tie probably would have passed it. It would have been adopted. It would have been signed.  Fast-forward to 2013, and here we were on the floor debating this issue, and I was very pleased to see it on the floor because Senator Kennedy and his team had asked me to carry the torch on the bill and work to see it passed. I had worked for us to hold hearings, and I had advocated with our leadership that it was time to put this issue on the floor, that we couldn't allow this discrimination to continue without at least working to address it. We might fail on the floor to pass this bill, but we should at least put it before the body, make the case, have the argument, fight to end this discrimination.  Here on the floor, we no longer have to get 50 votes and the President because the habits of the Senate changed, and now it is almost always required to get a supermajority to close debate. So we had to get 60 votes, not 51, but we did get 60 votes. We did close debate and go to a final vote. But one of the individuals who placed himself directly in the path to obstruct success on the bill, to obstruct the end of discrimination--job discrimination for LGBTQ communities--was our colleague and our nominee for Attorney I would hope to have a voice in the office that was seasoned through tough battles and stood up in difficult times to fight any discrimination, not to perpetuate discrimination. So that concerns me--substantially concerns me.  In 2013, the Senate voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, often referred to as VAWA, after Congress passed it. That was an important effort because a woman should never be a victim of violence in her own home. Nobody should be a victim of violence, but particularly to address the challenges that we see. And the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control notes that women in the United States experience roughly 4.8 million assaults and rapes per year from their intimate partner, and they are afraid to seek medical treatment. Less than 20 percent of battered women sought medical treatment.  The National Crime Victimization Survey--the statistics that I have here from 2006, so quite a while ago--says that over the course of the year, 33,000 women were sexually assaulted, more than 600 women every day. Women ages 20 to 24 are at greatest risk of nonfatal domestic violence, and women age 20 and higher suffer from the highest rates of rape.  The Justice Department estimates that one in five women will experience rape or attempted rape during her college years--just during those college years--and that less than 5 percent of these rapes will be reported.  Income is a factor. The poorer the household, the higher the rate of domestic violence. Women in the lowest income category experience more than six times the rate of intimate partner violence as compared to women in the highest income category. African-American women face the highest rates of violence. American-Indian women are victimized at a rate double that of women of other races.  The impact of these kinds of violence is huge and long-lasting. According to the Family and Violence Prevention Fund, growing up in a violent home may be terrifying, a traumatic experience that can effect every aspect of a child's life, growth, and development. Children who have been exposed to family violence suffer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as bed-wetting and nightmares, and were at greater risk than their peers of having allergies, asthma, gastrointestinal problems, headaches, and flu. In addition, women who experience physical abuse as children are at greater risk of victimization as adults.  Well, I go through all these statistics to note what a substantial issue this is in terms of crime and violence and the impact both on the victims and on the children in homes--an impact that damages children's ability to pursue a full, healthy path toward thriving as an adult, an impact that creates a cycle of violence.  In 2011, during one 24-hour period, 1,600 Oregon victims were served by domestic violence services. What are those services? Emergency shelter, children's support, transitional housing, support for teen victims of dating violence, therapy or counseling for children, advocacy related to cyber stalking. Additionally, during the same 24-hour period, Oregon domestic violence programs answered more than 27 hotline calls every hour.  VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act, has been a powerful tool in fighting these kinds of abuse, these kinds of violence in our community, and it has proven to dramatically reduce domestic violence. Among other things, in 2013 the VAWA reauthorization included measures to ensure that LGBTQ men and women cannot be turned away from domestic violence shelters. It addressed threats of violence against women in transgender communities, who face rates of domestic violence and sexual assault at much higher rates, as I noted before, than those faced by the general population. It provides tools and encourages best practices, which have proven to be effective to prevent domestic violence homicides by training law enforcement, victims service providers, and court personnel to identify and connect high-risk victims with crisis intervention services--all of this in the interest of preventing violence against women, and when such violence occurs, to get the treatment to be as robust and available as possible to assist those women.  I would hope to have the champion in this fight to decrease violence against women in the position of Attorney General of the United States of America, but my colleague, our nominee for Attorney General, voted against these practices for decreasing violence, voted against these efforts to provide greater support when the violence did occur, and that, for me, is a very substantial concern. This turned many women's advocacy groups into a position of opposing this confirmation.  And another factor came into play. In October of this last year when our nominee for Attorney General was asked his opinion about a 2005 audio recording which then-Candidate Trump was--well, he wasn't yet a candidate at the time of the audio recording--but he was heard bragging about inappropriately groping women. The nominee said he didn't think the behavior that was described was sexual assault. Senator Sessions said: ``I don't characterize that as sexual assault. I think that is a stretch,'' he said.  I couldn't more profoundly disagree. When someone grabs the intimate parts of an individual, that is an assault. How can one reach any other conclusion? Envision that your loved one is the one who is groped--your wife, your sister, your mother, or your daughter. You don't believe that is a sexual assault? I would like to have as our Attorney General an individual who would understand in the core of his or her being that this is an assault and wrong. The law makes it an assault. Morality makes it an assault. So that bothers me a great deal.  I do want to note that in a confirmation hearing, my colleague Senator Sessions changed his opinion on this and he noted what we would expect one to note. He said that yes, activity such as was noted on the recording of our now President, when asked whether it was an assault, he said clearly it would be. I appreciate that evolution, but the initial reaction before the confirmation hearing still disturbs me.  Earlier this month, the National Task Force to End Sexual Violence issued an open letter opposing his confirmation based on the record. In the letter, they stated, when referring to the nominee, that ``his history leads us to question whether he will vigorously seek to ensure all victims and survivors of gender-based violence, particularly vulnerable populations and those at the margins of society, have access to vitally needed services and legal protections.''[[Page S889]]  This goal to champion justice for all--perhaps it is easy to champion justice for the groups one most closely identifies with, but the role is to fight for justice for everyone throughout our society, and that is why this is of substantial concern.  The letter went on to say: ``Selective application of the law and outward hostility towards victims of sexual and domestic violence in historically marginalized populations has a chilling effect on their willingness and ability to seek services and protection. It then noted that the Attorney General of the United States must be an individual committed to protecting the inalienable rights of equal protection under the law to all--to all within the jurisdiction of the United  Let me say it again. We need an Attorney General who fights for equal justice for all.  Another issue we face--set of issues, really--is related to immigration. As we know, President Trump recently signed an Executive order barring travel by those from seven Muslim countries and also barring refugees into our country and having a longer ban on refugees specifically from And the first ban, the Muslim ban, came out as Rudy Giuliani told us of instructions to create a Muslim ban that would be changed enough to make it legal under the law.  There are many reasons to be concerned about this ban based on religion. We have a tradition of freedom of religion in our country. It is a freedom enshrined in our We have a tradition of religious tolerance. If we are a nation with religious freedom, religious tolerance goes hand in hand with that, but we have heard over the course of President Trump's campaign statement after statement that essentially presented a war on Islam, the Nation is at war with Islam--the opposite of religious freedom, the opposite of religious tolerance.  The worst aspect of this--and there are many bad aspects to it--is that it endangers our national security because of the recruiting strategy of Our President says he wants to diminish and extinguish. Their recruiting strategy is to claim that the United States is conducting a war on Islam, so this ban and this campaign feed right into that recruiting strategy. It has been pointed out by security expert after security expert after security expert that this makes us less safe.  Sally Yates, the Acting Attorney General, refused to defend this order in court because she believed it was illegal and unconstitutional. That is a principled stance, that despite that the head of the executive branch put something forward, the Attorney General said: No, that is wrong. That is not constitutional.  Well, she was fired shortly thereafter, for taking that stand, by President But then, two attorneys general from Washington State and Minnesota took the case to court, pointing out that they had substantial harm in their States as a result of this, giving them standing to challenge it--harmed because of professors trapped overseas, harmed from students trapped overseas, harmed from citizens in the States of Washington and Minnesota whose family members were trapped overseas. They put it to a district court judge, James Robart, a judge who was appointed by George The judge put a restraining order on the Executive order. To do that, one has to reach the standard that the case has merit and is likely to prevail.  So a judge, given this issue, the design of this issue, and the facts surrounding these orders, struck them down. And then it went to the Ninth Circuit Court, and the Ninth Circuit didn't find that there was enough information to change the decision of the district judge, but they asked for additional briefs, and they are expected to rule later this week. We will find out of course then how they weigh the issues.  Part of what is being taken into account are the facts on the ground, including was this designed around national security, and part of that debate recognizes that individuals from those seven countries have not come to America and killed  Now, individuals from other countries have come to America and killed Americans, but not from those seven countries. Then there is the question of whether it was based on religion, and they will be taking into account and looking at the fact that Rudy Giuliani said he was instructed to develop a Muslim ban but to make it look legal. So, clearly, there is evidence that the real intent of this wasn't national security but was religious discrimination.  Then there is the fact that the Executive order itself has a clause that says we will discriminate based on religion, letting in Christians while closing out They will consider all of that. We will see what they say.  There is considerable power in the executive branch and the Presidency for making rules related to immigration. There is considerable power to take actions related to national security, but the design of this suggests serious constitutional problems, and two very capable lawyers--one, the acting AG for the United States of America and, second, a district court judge--have found it fails the test.  I would like for us to have a nominee for Attorney General who would have the courage and convictions to stand up to a President when the President goes off track in violating the Constitution, and I am concerned that our nominee wouldn't reach the same courageous point of view that Sally Yates found or James Robart found. Even while noting that the courts are yet to ultimately decide, there are certainly heavy concerns that should be weighed intensely in this consideration, and I am not sure that would happen.  In 2015, Senator Sessions, my colleague, our nominee, authored a bill that would automatically cut off Federal funding to sanctuary cities that refused to have their police officers act as agents of our immigration force, as ICE agents. Just today, I had the sheriff of Multnomah County in Oregon come and speak to me. He was formerly the police chief of our largest city--the city of What he conveyed was that if you have police officers pursue each person they interact with on the basis of immigration, pretty soon people in the community will not work with you to solve crimes, and you actually create enormous public safety risks for the citizens in Multnomah Numerous mayors have pointed this out; that if you see your police force as one that is continuously trying to be an immigration agent rather than a police officer and you are pursuing folks with profiling--stopping everyone in the Hispanic community--that pretty soon the Hispanic community folks don't want to talk to you. They will not help you solve the crimes that occur. The community becomes less safe.  So this assault on public safety is a profound concern across this country.  I am disturbed that our nominee authored a bill to penalize cities and States that are seeking to reduce public violence and enhance public safety. That seems the opposite of what an Attorney General should do.  During his nomination hearing, Senator Sessions advocated for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or This is a program on which one needs to understand it by meeting individuals who are childhood arrivals. There are folks who have crossed the border into our country who have brought with them a baby in their arms, or a toddler, or a 4-year-old. Those individuals--those children, those babies--grow up in They speak They only know Most of the time--I will not say most of the time, but in many cases they don't know they were even born outside the country.  So these children were put into a position of saying: If you disclose your status and fill out all this paperwork, we will not send you back to a country you don't even know, that speaks a language you don't even know because you have grown up in America and you are going to contribute to America, if we embrace you. And you will just be a lost citizen--a citizen without a country--if you are sent out of the country to somewhere that would be totally unfamiliar to you.  In this position that our nominee took, that he thinks we should end this program, it means that those children would now be eligible for deportation. There is a substantial concern here because they were promised that their information would not be used, would not be turned over for their deportation when they signed up. They trusted that when the United States of America[[Page S890]]made this promise to them, that promise would be kept, but it appears we have a nominee who wants to end that program and, therefore, place all of these children at risk of deportation.  The nominee had no answer for what to do with the 800,000 children who have come out of the shadows because of that program.  In December 2015, Senator Sessions voted against Senator Leahy's sense-of-the-Senate resolution that affirmed that the United States must not bar people from another country because of their religion. Our nominee spoke for 30 minutes against the resolution. This takes me back to the echoes of this issue of the Muslim ban and discrimination based on religion that is so alien to the United States of  This resolution that affirmed that the United States would not bar people from our Nation because of their religion had the support of 96 Four Senators voted against the resolution, essentially saying it is OK to discriminate based on religion. Our nominee was one of those four Senators who conveyed through their vote that it would be OK to use a religious test for those entering the United  According to Bloomberg News, our nominee was one of the few lawmakers to defend President Trump's effort to propose a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, in this report of November 18, 2016. He told CNN's Dana Bash last June: Well, all I can tell you is, the public data we have had indicated that there are quite a number of countries that have sent a large number of people here who have become terrorists.  During his nomination hearing, our nominee tried to walk back his support for the Muslim ban. He said he would not back a complete and total shutdown of all Muslims entering the United So he evolved from a position he took in December of 2015 and was more moderate during the nomination hearing. But still I am concerned about the position he put forward at that debate in December of 2015, when he spoke for 30 minutes and was one of four Senators to refuse to support a resolution saying that the United States should not discriminate based on religion.  This Muslim ban and the vote on the December 2015 resolution leaves Muslim Americans wondering if our nominee would fully defend and advocate for them; whether our nominee, the President's nominee for Attorney General, would fight for equal justice for Muslims after supporting the position that it is OK to discriminate against Muslims entering our country. That concerns me because that is not the position I would like to see represented in the President's nominee for this office.  My office has been receiving an enormous number of phone calls, emails, and letters about a whole host of nominees, and I think it is appropriate to share some of those as well as to note that a group of 1,424 law school professors nationwide sent a letter to Congress urging us to vote no on this nomination, representing 180 law schools in 49  I am not going to share all of the letter because I want to stay within the bounds of the debate. So I will just note this: They lay out a whole number of concerns about positions taken in the past.  I will summarize it with a final paragraph: As law faculty who work every day to better the understanding of the law and to teach it to our students, we are convinced that the President's nominee will not fairly enforce our Nation's laws and promote justice and equality in the United  That is 1,424 law school professors from 180 law schools looking at the record of the President's nominee.  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Human Rights gives our nominee a zero-percent score. The Human Rights Campaign, which fights for justice for the LGBT community, gives the President's nominee a zero-percent score. The NAACP has repeatedly given grades of F to the nominee. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the ACLU have voiced vigorous opposition.  I will share some of the letter from back home. Cobin from Portland, an assistant professor, writes: I am writing today to state my strong dissent for the nominee to be U.Attorney While this should be self-evident given his record, in light of this past week's events, it is all the more critical we have an Attorney General willing to fight for our Protecting our fundamental values as Americans is priceless.  From Southern Oregon, Karen of Jackson County writes: I am strongly opposed to the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney His support of President Trump's views regarding immigration and voting rights are unacceptable and make him unacceptable to be the Nation's chief law enforcer.  Letter after letter expresses concerns about the record.  Earlier tonight, my colleague from Massachusetts was sharing testimony Coretta Scott King presented on March 13, 1986, to the Senate Judiciary Committee when my colleague was nominated to the U.District Court for the Southern District of The Senate at that point in time rejected the nomination. They did so after examining a whole series of events which had transpired under his leadership. I can't read those events under the rules of the Senate because they would constitute a critique of a fellow So I am just summarizing that her letter laid them out, and the Senate Judiciary Committee fully explored the issues presented by Coretta Scott King, and by many others, and decided there wasn't the judicial vision appropriate for someone to serve as a judge in the United States of  If that series of events led to the unusual outcome of the Senate deciding that an individual's background--a background related to efforts to prevent African Americans from voting, weighed it incorrectly, not right that an individual be serving as a judge, that same background should be weighed by all of us here this morning, in this debate, over whether a nominee has the judicial heart of Lady Liberty to judge everyone without discrimination, to fight equally for everyone without discrimination. The answer years ago by this Chamber was no.  After I have weighed the many positions presented tonight which are deeply troubling, and the history that led this Chamber to make the decision it did back in 1986, I will have to join those who say and vote no on this nomination.

12275,topic-id,3535,"Mr.President, as I began last night at 4 in the morning--[[Page S899]]now 5:30--I thank the staff, both the nonpartisan staff and those in the majority and minority for enduring another late night. These are exceptional times. Thus we are here again in the early, early morning to talk about a nomination to the President's  This is my first time on the floor since Senator Warren was gaveled down last evening. Let me just speak for a moment about my deep, deep disappointment at the events of early last evening. I want to put this in the context of the political moment that we are living in.  We have a President of the United States today who is a bully, who is using his office to try to stifle and quell debate. If you dare oppose him--frankly, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat--you are going to be called names, you are going to be mocked in an effort to try to silence you.  In the last week, we have seen President Trump attempt this tactic on members of the judiciary. When he got a ruling he didn't like from a judge in Washington that temporarily halted his ban on Muslims entering the country, he started personally attacking this judge, sending a signal to those in the judicial branch that, if you dare oppose him, you are going to be singled out for ridicule.  The President of the United States is going to try to destroy your reputation and your career as a judge, as a jurist, as an impartial arbiter of the law if you rule against his political interests. It is an exceptional moment. It is an exceptional moment in which the President of the United States is trying to bully judges into ruling in his favor. It is an exceptional moment, though we have been watching it for the last 2 years, in which the President is trying to bully Members of Congress to cow to his interests.  I want to be very careful about how I talk about this because I have great respect for the parliamentary rulings of this body. But I don't understand why our majority leader chose to gavel down Senator Warren when she was simply reading a letter from Coretta Scott  We celebrate the legacy of Martin Luther King with a holiday every year in this country. In the pantheon of individual greatness in the United States of America, it doesn't get any higher than Martin Luther His widow wrote us a letter expressing her objections to the nomination of Jeff Sessions based upon the belief that he would not live up to the legacy of her husband and his work in civil rights.  Nothing could be more relevant to this discussion than the opinion of a member of Martin Luther King's family on whether or not this nominee was going to enforce appropriately, vigorously the civil rights laws of this Nation, and Senator Warren was silenced.  Now, I don't know what the motive was, and it certainly would be inappropriate for me to guess at it. But the effect of the majority leader's action is to stifle debate, to make it less likely that Members of the Democratic minority will raise objections to Senator Sessions' nomination and record objections as to his conduct.  I am not trying to equate what happened here last night with what our President has done, but there is a practice now. There is a pattern of behavior among Republicans, trying to stifle and quell opposition to this The President uses the bullying power of Twitter, and the majority leader now is twisting the rules of the  I say that because, while it may be true that technically the rules of the Senate don't allow you to talk about the conduct of a fellow Senator, how on Earth can you debate a nominee from this body to the Cabinet without questioning their conduct?  So technically, the rule may say that you cannot talk about the conduct of a fellow Senator, but how on Earth can this body operate when Members of it are nominated to important positions if we cannot talk about the conduct of fellow Members and we cannot criticize the conduct of fellow Members?  Now, I appreciate the fact that Senator Merkley was able to come down to the floor and read the full letter into the Record overnight. I appreciate the fact that Senator Booker was able to read into the Record testimony from another civil rights hero, John Lewis, without being similarly gaveled down for his conduct.  But this effort, this continued effort to try to stop people who oppose President Trump and his agenda from speaking truth to power is not right. It is not right. And it will, frankly, have the opposite effect.  You have seen what happened overnight on our side. We are not going to stop talking about Senator Sessions' record and how we believe it is disqualifying for his nomination for Attorney The protests and the numbers of people gathering around the country to object to the policies of President Trump are getting bigger and bigger the more that he bullies and bullies. This isn't going to work.  So I am going to speak to Senator Sessions' record. I am going to speak to how I believe it does not qualify him to be Attorney General, and that doesn't mean that I don't have great respect for him. I have worked with Senator Sessions on a number of issues. But if I can't talk about Senator Sessions' record, if I can't talk about his conduct as a Senator, as it relates to whether or not he can be the chief law enforcement official in this country, then there is no use in having this debate at all.  Senator Sessions has publicly called the Voting Rights Act intrusive. In response to the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County, AL, v. Holder, which gutted section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Senator Sessions called it a good thing for the  That decision made it vastly more difficult for the Federal Government to protect individuals from racial discrimination in voting. The Supreme Court effectively substituted their political judgment on the status of racism in America for the judgment of this Effectively, the Supreme Court was saying in that decision that in our belief, racism is no longer a problem in the way that it was when the Voting Rights Act was passed, and, thus, there is no longer an imperative for section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which allows for the Federal Government to oversee the voting laws of a select number of counties with patterns of racial discrimination.  That was an absurd ruling.  I have great respect for the members of the Supreme Court, but they live inside the ivory-ensconced marble of the Supreme Court chamber. They don't have experience on the ground, like the elected Members of this body do, to understand the reality of racism in America today. I wish it were gone, but it is not. Blacks and Hispanics are still discriminated against.  You just have to look to see what happened in North Carolina to understand the truth of that. North Carolina passed a number of laws which, on their face, they argued were not discriminatory. They were just, in their words, voter protections, buffers against voter fraud. And then, when we read the correspondence of the members of the State legislature to pass that law, what we learned is that they were specifically intended to try to stop African Americans from voting. The people who were passing those laws were talking to each other trying to figure out how they could most effectively target laws to stop African Americans from voting. That was their clear intent, even though they argue that there was no racial bias implicit in the passage of that law.  Racism is not dead in You don't wash away discrimination in just one generation--a generation and a half, maybe--after laws that separated the races with respect to public accommodations and restaurants and drinking fountains and bathrooms. That doesn't just vanish in one generation later. Everybody understands that.  Poll after poll will show you that there are still people in this country who believe that African Americans and Hispanics are inferior. I wish it weren't the case, but it still is. So we still need the Voting Rights We still need the Civil Rights And we are about to vote on a nominee to be Attorney General who calls the Voting Rights Act intrusive, who says that a Supreme Court decision that guts the Voting Rights Act is ``a good thing for the South.'' It is not a good thing for African Americans in the It is not a good thing for Hispanics in the It may be a good thing for the people who wrote those discriminatory laws, but it is not a good thing for those who are trying to vote who have[[Page S900]]witnessed and lived through decades of discrimination.  Let me talk about Senator Sessions' record on immigration. In 2007, Senator Sessions referred to a comprehensive immigration reform bill as ``terrorist assistance.'' He has been a leading voice in Congress in arguing against immigration reform. In two decades in the Senate, Senator Sessions has opposed every single immigration bill that has included a pathway to citizenship. He has favored, similar to President Trump, an ideological test for admission to the United He said this:       Immigration policy must be guided by our understanding that      western society is unique and special. Our values, our rules,      our traditions are what make our society succeed where others      fail. It is necessary and proper to choose who among the      world's 7 billion people will be granted the high honor of      immigration to the United States on the basis of confidence      that they share our values.  That is a radical idea. Why don't we think about that for a second. The Attorney General of the United States will make important decisions about the enforcement of immigration law in this country. Much of what happens in immigration policy happens in the Department of Homeland Security, but the Attorney General makes important decisions about upholding the law on immigration policy, and we are about to vote to confirm a Member of this body who has said that there should be an ideological test for admission to the United States and that you have to share our values. I don't know what that means, but the greatness of the United States is based on the fact that we have been able to bring people from a variety of different backgrounds, a variety of different value sets, a variety of different religions--bring them into this country and allow them to keep part of their heritage, part of their belief system from the places they came from, whether they be Ireland or England or China or Mexico, and then also assimilate into the whole and adopt part of this country's short history of tradition over the last 240 years. What makes America great is that we allow people to bring values different from ours into this country, which in turn strengthens our collective set of values. We are constantly challenging ourselves with new ideas, with new perspectives.  Senator Sessions has been an opponent of Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. This is commonly referred to as DACA--the idea that if you are a child who came to this country when you were very young, knowing nothing other than the United States, an American in name if not legal status, then you should be able to stay in this country. It is cruel and inhumane to take a young man or woman who came to this country when they were 3 or 4 years old and send them back to their country of birth, and I think Democrats and Republicans of goodwill generally agree, if not on the broad aspects of the pathway to citizenship, that for these kids, these DREAMers as they call them, they should be able to stay in the United Senator Sessions has vigorously opposed this policy and many DACA-protected immigrants now fear deportation under a Department of Justice that is led by Senator  His conduct tells us that he opposes protections for young men and women who know nothing other than the United States and want simply to have a shot with the American dream. That conduct is relevant to whether he is qualified to be Attorney  On criminal justice reform, Senator Sessions has personally blocked the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which is a bipartisan effort spearheaded by Senators Grassley, Lee, Cornyn, and Speaker of the House Paul As Attorney General, Senator Sessions will have the power to direct Federal prosecutors throughout the country to pursue the harshest penalties possible for even low-level drug offenses, a step that would further exacerbate our national record of incarcerating nonviolent offenders, the vast majority of whom can be successfully treated at far lower cost to society with appropriate health care treatment for their addiction or mental illness. Senator Sessions' conduct in this body has been to oppose efforts to try to treat with more compassion and commonsense offenders in this country who would be better served through treatment than through incarceration, so it is relevant to his nomination to be Attorney General where he will have broad discretion to lock up people for low-level offenses.  In Connecticut, we made the decision to divert people who are convicted of crimes but have serious mental illness or addiction into treatment. We have made the decision to reserve our prison system for the worst of the worst, mainly for violent offenders, for those who are convicted of serious crimes.  Connecticut has seen its prison population fall to a 20-year low. On September 3, 2016, the prison population in Connecticut dropped below 15,000 for the first time since January of 1997. At the same time, rates of reported violent crimes have plummeted in So the proof is in the pudding in my My State has reduced its prison population and at the same time has reduced its level of violent crime and many States can tell the same story. Yet we can predict through his record on the floor of the U.Senate that Senator Sessions may use his power as Attorney General to reverse that trend line and lock up more of my constituents, which I would argue will have an upward effect on the rates of violent crime. Why? Because those individuals, having gone through the process of incarceration and coming out unreformed, untreated, will be no less of a danger to society.  Finally, I want to talk about the issue of gun violence in this country. Obviously this is very personal to me, still watching the community of Newtown spiral through ripples of grief associated with the trauma of December of 2012. Senator Sessions and I clearly have differences about the way in which the Federal Government should restrict the flow of firearms in this country.  You know, it has to be relevant to the decision that I make. This is the chief law enforcement official of this country, so the views on firearms are relevant. Whether or not the Attorney General has the discretion to make policy on the issue of what firearms are legal and what aren't or what sales are subject to background checks and what aren't, there is a bully pulpit associated with the chief law enforcement official that carries weight, so Senator Sessions' beliefs on firearms policy are relevant. His record and his conduct in the U.Senate on the question of gun violence is relevant as to whether he should be our next Attorney Senator Sessions has lined up with the gun lobby over and over again against commonsense reform of our gun laws that are supported by 90 percent of  He has voted against expanding background checks to cover sales at gun shows or online. He has voted against a bipartisan effort in the Senate to make sure that if you are on the terrorist watch list that you cannot purchase a weapon. He has voted against efforts to try to restrict sales of high capacity magazines and assault weapons, the kinds of magazines and the kinds of weapons that were used in the horrific crime in Sandy What Senator Sessions has said is that, if he were confirmed, he would take on the rising homicide rates in some American cities by working against illegal firearms use. He has pledged that he will enforce the law. Yet, again, coming back to his conduct and his record in this body, he has been part of an effort to try to strip from the Department of Justice and its appendages the tools they need in order to enforce the law. Every year we have on our appropriations bills riders that specifically stop the ATF from enforcing existing law. We restrict their ability to do inventories of gun dealers. We prohibit them from keeping modern databases on gun sales across the country.  The policy that Senator Sessions has backed and voted for in this body runs contrary to the statements that he has made. He has supported efforts to rob from the Department of Justice the ability to enforce the existing law on guns, yet he says when he gets there that he is going to use all efforts to enforce the law. Further, he has opposed efforts to give new tools to the Department of Justice to try to keep our streets safer. Shortly after Sandy Hook, he specifically debated on this floor legislation that would make it a Federal crime to traffic in illegal guns. I don't know how much less controversial you can get when it comes to gun policy. We all agree that you shouldn't[[Page S901]]be able to walk into a store, buy guns, say they are for you, and then go out on to the streets and sell them to criminals. It happens all the time in our cities.  Somebody goes and buys a mess of guns at a gun store or gun show and then goes into a city and sells them out of a trunk of a car to criminals who couldn't otherwise go buy these guns because of their criminal background.  So we proposed a simple Federal law that would make it a Federal crime to do that, and you need that, because States can't enforce that on a State by State basis because these guns are often trafficked across State lines. Senator Sessions voted against that. He is not going to be a champion for enforcing the gun laws of this His record is not going to magically transform when he becomes Attorney I have great respect for Senator Sessions, but he has been a chief opponent of making the gun laws of this country more amenable to proper and appropriate and efficient enforcement, and that is not going to change when he becomes Attorney  So I am going to vote against his nomination later today, and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well. His record on civil rights, on criminal justice, on immigration, and on gun policy do not qualify him to be Attorney  I am deeply sad about what happened here last night with respect to the letter read into the Record by Senator I understand that things seem to be breaking down a little bit in this Chamber, that nerves are frayed and people are acting in ways that maybe they wouldn't have acted a few years ago. These are exceptional times. I have never seen a President like this, trying to divide us from each other, using his position to bully and intimidate his political opponents. Raving about a brutal dictator in Moscow who murders people. We have never seen a moment like this. We should be really careful that we don't model that behavior here in the  What makes me sad is that it looked to me like that is what happened--that in this body the majority party tried to use the rules of the Senate in order to bully Members of the minority into silence. It is not going to work. If we want to get back to being able to function as a body, then we better be OK with being able to have some open, honest conversations about the future of this country and the future of this body.  I am going to vote against Senator Sessions today. That doesn't mean that I haven't enjoyed working with him on a number of subjects, but he is not the right person to be Attorney General--not close, frankly--and I hope that over the course of the day my colleagues continue to talk about his conduct, continue to talk about his record, and continue to explain why it does not qualify him in any way, shape, or form to be the chief law enforcement official in this country.

12321,topic-id,1517,"Mr.President, I stand here today to give a voice to the thousands of people who have contacted me in recent weeks urging me to vote no on this nomination. First, I need to express my frustration and outrage about what happened here on the floor last night.  In the middle of a debate about the next Attorney General--someone whose job it will be to defend the rights of all Americans; whose job it is to defend people from discrimination, inequity, and unfairness; whose job it is to defend women, to defend people of color, to defend all those who are too often told to sit down, stand down, be quiet--we saw the Republican leader selectively use the rules to silence our colleague, a woman Senator, who was reading the words of an African-American woman and a historic civil rights leader, reading the words of someone who embodies the fight for justice, for freedom, for equality, and for civil rights in America; someone who all of us should be looking to for lessons in these times, not someone whose words should be silenced because she said something people may not enjoy hearing.  At a moment when we are engaged in a debate about how best to defend our fellow citizens from discrimination and fight back against forces that seek to demean others in order to gain power, I was stunned. I respect the decorum that the Senate strives to maintain, but there are times when you cannot stay silent. This is one of those times. We will not be silent.  So I want to say that I stand with my friend, the Senator from I stand with the words of the late Coretta Scott King, and I stand with the many people who have contacted me about this nominee that we are debating here today. I can tell you that the day President Trump announced he had picked Senator Jeff Sessions to lead the Department of Justice, the phones in my office lit up. People from across my home State of Washington contacted my office to express their shock, their outrage, and their fear.  The calls came from people who help LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness; groups who have tirelessly advocated for necessary criminal justice reform; families caught in a broken immigration system; civil rights advocates and community leaders who have fought for decades to create a more just society; advocates and nonprofits trying to help women escape domestic violence. The list goes on.  That was in And in the weeks and months since the President made his choice for Attorney General known, those concerns have not died down. In fact, they have only gotten louder and more urgent as the public gets a better look at Senator Sessions' long record, what he stands for, and where he wants to take this country. I share their concerns.  It is why I will oppose Senator Sessions' nomination to be Attorney I urge my colleagues to join me to reject this nomination, and send a message to the new President about the rule of law in this country. Send a message to the new President, who came into office showing blatant disregard for our traditions of transparency, traditions that tell us the President has a duty to put the needs of the American people before the needs of his bank account. Send a message to someone who, just weeks into his term, has displayed shocking disdain for the U.Constitution and the separation of powers, the[[Page S934]]same President who fired an Acting Attorney General because she refused to ignore the law, to approve his hateful and unconstitutional Executive order barring refugees; the same President who ridiculed a well-respected Federal judge in Seattle, a George Bush appointee, because the judge didn't rule the way he wanted.  The U.Attorney General is often the last line of defense for our Constitution within an administration. And they need to be the first to stand up to our President when our President is wrong.  Senator Jeff Sessions is not that kind of nominee. The people of this country expect and deserve an Attorney General who will protect their civil and constitutional rights and liberties. They deserve someone committed to the principles of inclusiveness and justice--someone who will fiercely defend the rights of all Americans to be treated equally under the law. The American people need an Attorney General who continues to make the fight against racism, discrimination, and hate crimes a core part of that Department's mission. We know Senator Sessions is not the person for that job.  More than 30 years ago, he couldn't even pass muster in a Republican-majority During his confirmation hearing, Senators cited his racially charged comments and his shameful record on civil rights as a U.attorney as reasons they could not support him. And as my late colleague Ted Kennedy said at the time: ``It is inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.attorney, let alone a U.Federal judge.''  I ask my colleagues who are inclined to support his nomination today, What has changed? I have served alongside Senator Sessions for years, and I know his record all too well. And like my constituents who started sounding the alarm back in November, I am deeply concerned by his agenda that would take our country backward.  Senator Sessions has dismissed one of our bedrock civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act, as ``intrusive,'' while pushing restrictive voter ID laws and fueling conspiracy theories about voter fraud. I watched as he refused to work with a bipartisan majority of the Senate on immigration reform and instead pushed extreme policies that would punish the most vulnerable members of our communities. And that, by the way, included DREAMers across the country who have never known another home besides His personal passion on that issue and his years of advocacy against commonsense immigration policies cause me great concern about whether he would use the Department of Justice to pursue his extreme anti-immigration agenda.  On criminal justice reform, he beat back efforts from within his own party to address the exploding race of incarceration across this country. The injustice of these laws falls disproportionately on communities of color.  Time and again, he has defended laws that favor throwing nonviolent offenders in jail rather than working to rehabilitate them, even though it has been consistently proven that prison is not a means of rehabilitation. This nominee's views on criminal justice reform are so out of the mainstream, his position is even at odds with the Koch brothers.  At the very time our Nation engages in a critically important debate about ensuring equal treatment under the law, as we continue the struggle to make sure equality shines through our education system, our justice system, our economy, and our country, Senator Sessions remains dismissive of the very tools our Justice Department must use to move us forward.  When I joined so many of my colleagues in the Senate to reauthorize and improve the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act to protect women across the country, Senator Sessions worked against us to tear it apart. As someone who has sat face-to-face with survivors of domestic violence and fought to increase protections for those dealing with sexual assault, I can see why people would question whether Senator Sessions has any intention of enforcing the laws that protect them because I wonder that myself.  This nominee's track record of trying to undermine women's constitutionally protected reproductive rights is horrifying and should, by the way, scare every woman in this country.  I have heard from so many members of the LGBTQ community who are terrified that Senator Sessions would be tasked with protecting their rights. His votes against repealing don't ask, don't tell and expanding hate crimes definitions to include LGBTQ Americans confirm those fears.  This alone has to give my colleagues pause when so many Americans--our friends, our family members, our coworkers--fear that their government will look the other way as they endure violence, discrimination, and marginalization just because of who they love or how they live. We must fight back with everything we have.  When this President attacks the independence of our judges--judges who have declared the obvious, that the Muslim ban Executive order is unconstitutional--we cannot put the person who Steve Bannon calls ``the fiercest, most dedicated and most loyal promoter'' of the President's agenda at the head of the Department of This is not who we are.  Senator Sessions is not the Attorney General this country needs. I urge members of the Senate to stand up for the Constitution, to stand with your fellow The stakes are far too high to make Senator Sessions our next Attorney  I urge you to join with me in voting against this nomination. Now more than ever, we need an Attorney General who will be independent and willing to stand up to President Trump's illegal and unconstitutional actions whenever they happen.  The last thing this country needs right now is a rubber stamp to validate this administration's illegal actions.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

12415,topic-id,1039,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to once again urge my fellow Senators to vote against this resolution, which will weaken our bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act and will hurt students and schools across the country. I wish to quickly run through the reasons why passing this resolution will hurt our students.  First, voting for this resolution will throw States and school districts into chaos just as they are beginning to implement this law. Secretary DeVos has already sent a letter to State chiefs suggesting that a new State template for plan submission would be coming, less than a month before approximately 18 States and the District of Columbia intend to submit their plans. This timeline will not allow enough time for the stakeholder review process that is required in the law and may force States to reopen their plans and delay implementation of the law.  Secondly, the Every Student Succeeds Act is a civil rights law at its core. We know from experience that without strong accountability, kids from low-income neighborhoods, students of color, kids with disabilities, and students learning English too often fall through the cracks, and now it is up to all of us to uphold the civil rights legacy of the law and its promise for students by voting against this resolution.  I wish to spend a little more time on the third reason. It should concern all of us that if this resolution passes, it will give Secretary DeVos a blank check to promote her anti-public school agenda. During her confirmation process, my colleagues and millions of Americans saw that Secretary DeVos lacks a basic understanding of key concepts in public education policy, and even more concerning, she has openly questioned the role of the Federal Government in protecting our most vulnerable students.  After her hearings, millions of people across the country stood up, made their voices heard, and called on the Senate to reject her confirmation. Although she squeaked through with an unprecedented tie--the breaking vote from Vice President Pence--it was clear that Democrats, Republicans, and people across the country rejected her anti-public school agenda. Instead, they want the Department of Education to stand with students and with schools. We cannot in good conscience, through this rule, give Secretary DeVos another tool to promote her anti-public school agenda in ESSA implementation, and that is exactly what passing this resolution will do.  My colleagues across the aisle--the senior Senator from Tennessee made a number of claims in his remarks yesterday about this rule, and I want to go through a few of them because I believe they were off base on a number of levels.  First, the way my friend talked about what the law allows, or doesn't allow, in terms of rulemaking is absolutely wrong. Major laws like the Every Student Succeeds Act allow for and depend on Federal agencies to issue rules that help implement and clarify said laws. The Every Student Succeeds Act maintains the Secretary's overall authority to issue[[Page S1713]]rules and clarifications that are consistent with the law. This rule before us today is consistent with ESSA, and it provides important clarity to our States, our school districts, and our schools.  Secondly, the senior Senator from Tennessee misrepresented how this rule requires States to rate schools. While the Department's initial rule did require States to provide schools with a ``summative rating,'' my colleague across the aisle, as well as a number of education stakeholder groups, requested that the Department provide States more flexibility. The Department listened and took this out of the final rule which we are talking about today. In fact, the Council of Chief State School Officers, one of the groups who was concerned with the summative rating, said in a statement in response to this rule: ``It is clear the U.Department of Education listened to the feedback from state education chiefs across the country and made several important changes to ensure the accountability provisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act can be implemented in all States.'' And now the final rule only requires States to comply with ESSA in this area.  Finally, I want to say that my colleague was simply wrong in the way he talked about the impact of this rule on schools that are struggling. ESSA provides guardrails to make sure that grant sizes are sufficient to meet the needs of students, but it provides States with the flexibility to allot smaller grants to smaller sized districts and schools if that is what works best for them. But this rule in no way limits State decisionmaking in this area.  Those are just a few of the ways this rule was mischaracterized over the course of the debate. There were many others. I just have to say that it is disappointing because Democrats and Republicans worked together on this law. I thought there was a clear understanding of what the law intended. I assumed my colleagues understood what the Department was doing to implement our law in an open and collaborative way, and it is very concerning to me to hear such partisanship and false representations of our bipartisan law.  This rule does not dictate what States have to do in struggling schools. Instead, it balances the goals of ESSA--flexibility with Federal guardrails--and provides important clarity for our  A vote for this resolution is a vote to run away from the bipartisan nature of the Every Student Succeeds It is a blunt instrument and a significant step in the wrong direction, and it will have a serious impact on our students, our schools, and our districts across the country.  I am disheartened to see that my Republican colleagues are jamming this partisan play through in the same fashion they did with Secretary DeVos's nomination.  Over the past few months, millions of students, parents, and teachers have made their voices heard about the importance of public education to them. They want us to work together, and they want us to build on the bipartisan law. This resolution does exactly the opposite.  I urge our colleagues to vote against this resolution and vote for our schools and our students and to vote for the bipartisan ESSA law.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

12337,topic-id,3135,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the nomination of Senator Sessions to be the next Attorney I believe one of the most important jobs of a U.Attorney General is to protect the people's right to vote.  In the tumultuous days of the early 1960s, on a hot afternoon, I watched on a grainy black and white TV as King delivered his memorable ``I Have a Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln  His soaring, spiritually laced speech challenged us to commit our lives to ensuring that the promises of American democracy were available, not just for the privileged few but for ``all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics.''  ``Now is the time,'' King urged, ``to make real the promises of democracy.'' He stressed that a central promise made to the citizens in a democracy is the right to vote and to have that vote counted. He said: ``We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.''  Half a century has passed, and our country has changed with the times, but one thing has not changed. The right to vote for ``all God's children'' in America is still under assault. Unbelievably, we are not so very far from the problems of 1963. Despite the passage of time and landmark civil and voting rights legislation, five decades later there is still considerable voter suppression in this country.  In fact, several States have recently enacted restrictive laws cutting back voting hours on nights and on weekends, eliminating same-day registration, and basically making it harder for people to vote. Standing in between a citizen and the voting booth is a direct contradiction to the vision of equality put forth by our Founding In 1776, they declared that all men were created equal, but many in our country had to wait another 94 years before the 15th Amendment to the Constitution granted citizens the right to vote--though not all citizens. Ratified in 1870, the amendment states: ``The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.''  It still took another 50 years before women in America were allowed to vote. After her arrest for casting a ballot in the Presidential election of 1872, Susan Anthony delivered a number of speeches in Upstate New York on women's suffrage. In those speeches, she noted that the right of all citizens to vote in elections is key to a functioning democracy.  Specifically, one line from her speech stands out. ``And it is a downright mockery to talk to women of their enjoyment of the blessings of liberty while they are denied the use of the only means of securing them by providing the democratic-republican government--the ballot.''  After the passage of the 19th Amendment granting women the ballot, it took another 45 years before our Nation belatedly enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 intended to guarantee every U.citizen the right to vote. Does this principle really hold true in practice?  The continued voter suppression of which I speak may not be as blatant as it once was with Jim Crow laws and poll taxes and literacy tests and the like, but it is still very much with us.  In recent years, it is obvious that hurdles have once again been placed between the voting booth and the young and minority voters. A devastating blow was dealt by the U.Supreme Court when it gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Our Nation's highest Court struck down a central provision of the law that was used to guarantee fair elections in this country since the mid-1960s, and that includes the guarantee of elections in my State of Florida since that time.  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to protect our right to vote. It required States with a history of voter suppression to get Federal approval before changing their voting laws. And for nearly five decades, the States had to prove to the Department of Justice why a change was necessary and demonstrate how that change would not harm voters.  In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court declared that part of the law was outdated. It essentially rendered a key part of the law void until a bitterly partisan and gridlocked Congress can come up with a new formula for determining which States and localities need advance approval to amend their right-to-vote laws. The majority justified its ruling in the Court by pointing out that we no longer had the blatant voter suppression tactics once used to disenfranchise targeted voters across the country. I vigorously disagree because removing much needed voter protections also prevents the Federal Government from trying to block discriminatory State laws before they go into effect. In essence, States and local jurisdictions are now legally free to do as they please.  In fact, just moments after the decision, the Texas attorney general said his State would begin ``immediately'' honoring local legislation that a fellow court had imposed ``strict and unforgiving burdens'' on many Texans attempting to cast a ballot.  As has been noted, the right to vote was not always given to all American adults, but our laws adjusted as we became a more mature and tolerant democracy. But the reverse is what has been happening in America today and especially in  Since the 2010 election, in addition to cutting back on early voting, North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Florida have approved voting restrictions that according to some experts are targeted directly at reducing turnout among young, low-income, and minority voters who traditionally support  One study by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law reviewed the crop of similar disenfranchisement laws that were enacted after the 2010 decision. All told, the center found that as many as 5 million Americans could be adversely affected by these voting laws, and there is a clear political impact as a result of these disenfranchisement laws.  Two University of Massachusetts professors conducted a study that found that there was a clear pattern associated with the voter restrictions in the various According to Keith Bentele and Erin O'Brien, States were more likely to pass limits on voting that elected those Republican Governors, those States that increased their share of Republican lawmakers, and those States that became more electorally competitive under  In 2011, the Florida legislature and State officials reduced a number of early voting days. They reduced them from 2 weeks down to 8 days, including very conveniently canceling the Sunday right before the Tuesday election, a day that had historically seen heavy African-American and Hispanic voting.[[Page S946]]  State officials countered that registered voters would still have the same number of hours and that they could still vote early, only in 8 days instead of 2 weeks. Well, it didn't work out that way. Florida also made voting harder for people who had been recently moved to another county and had an address change, such as college students, after it subjected voter registration groups to penalties and fines for mistakes--voter registration, mind you, penalties, and fines if you didn't turn it in within a certain number of hours.  They were so burdensome that the League of Women Voters challenged the provision in Federal court and they won but not before Jill Cicciarelli, a Florida teacher, had helped her students preregister to vote and ended up facing legal troubles as the result of her well-intentioned public service. A schoolteacher, teaching a government class, getting her kids preregistered, so when they became 18, they could vote, and she got in trouble with the State of The New Smyrna Beach High School civics teacher unwittingly ran afoul of the State's new convoluted election law. Cicciarelli, it turned out, hadn't registered with the State before beginning the drive and didn't submit forms to the elections office within that short number of hours. ``You're talking about a high-energy teacher who cares about her kids, cares about her community and cares about her country,'' is how the New Smyrna High School principal, Jim Tager, described the situation.  Thankfully, the Voting Rights Act allowed the Federal Government to go before a panel of Washington, DC, judges who found that Florida's 2011 reduction of early voting--which I have just chronicled--here is what the court said, ``would make it materially more difficult for some minority voters to cast a ballot.'' As a result, Florida had to restore 96 hours of early voting.  Even with these added protections, the next election in 2012 was a fiasco. Lines outside the polling places were prohibitively long, with some people waiting up to 8 hours to cast their vote. I am not kidding the There were lines in Dade County, Miami Dade County, 7 and 8 hours. By the way, some of those lines, there wasn't a nearby bathroom. Faced with calls for extending poll hours, the Governor of Florida failed to do what its two Republican gubernatorial predecessors had done: extend voting hours in some of the most swamped polling places to give folks enough time to exercise their right to vote.  In fact, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis found that in 2012, Florida had the Nation's longest waiting lines to vote at an average statewide of 45 minutes. More than 200,000 voters in Florida gave up in frustration because the lines were so long. They didn't vote that year. According to another analysis by Ohio State University, in the Orlando Sentinel, they are the ones who came up with that 200,000 figure, and they aren't done yet.  As if the 2011 restrictions weren't enough, an elections official in Miami-Dade County, in 2012, said that restrooms would be closed to voters at polling sites in private buildings over a handicap access dispute, even though there were bathrooms in those private buildings where the polling place was. The State's top election official in 2012 also told one of our 67 local election supervisors not to allow voters to submit absentee ballots at remote dropoff sites. She, by the way, is a Republican supervisor of elections. She told the State Department Division of Elections to kiss off; that she was running the elections and she was going to make sure there were enough places around that county where, if they had an absentee ballot, it was going to be convenient for them to go and drop off that absentee ballot than having to take it miles and miles to one place, that the Division of Elections at the State level was telling them to go to that Supervisor of She knew what she had to do to make it easy for voters to vote, and she stuck to her guns.  At the same time, that same Division of Elections in the Department of State, denied a request from the city of Gainesville in a municipal election. They denied the request to use the University of Florida campus building for early voting. A move that was viewed by some--more than some--as an assault on student voting by making it more difficult for students to find a place to vote.  By then, I had asked the U.Attorney General Eric Holder, for an investigation into the changes in Florida's voting law. In response, the Attorney General wrote to warn the Governor of Florida that the Justice Department would be ``carefully monitoring'' Florida's elections. ``During your tenure, your State has repeatedly added barriers to voting and restricted access to the polls,'' the Attorney General wrote. ``Whenever warranted by the facts and the law, we will not hesitate to use all tools and legal authorities at our disposal to fight against racial discrimination, to stand against disenfranchisement, and to safeguard the right of every eligible American to cast a ballot.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the U.Attorney General to the Governor of Florida, dated July 21, 2014.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     Office of the                                             Attorney General,                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2014.     Rick Scott,     Governor of Florida, The Capitol, Tallahassee,       Dear Governor Scott: In recent years. I have heard from      public officials and citizens of Florida expressing their      deep concern that certain changes to Florida election law and      procedures have restricted voter participation and limited      access to the franchise. Because the right to vote is one of      our nation's most sacred rights, I strongly urge you to      reevaluate laws and procedures that make it harder for      citizens to register and to vote so that all eligible      Floridians can easily and without burden exercise their right      to vote.       Generations of Americans took extraordinary risks and      willingly confronted hatred and violence--including in your      home state--to ensure that all American citizens would have      the chance to participate in the work of their government.      The right to vote is not only the cornerstone or our system      of government--it is the lifeblood of our democracy. Whatever      the precise contours of federal law, we each have a civic and      moral duty to protect, and to expand access to, this right.       For this reason, I am deeply disturbed that during your      tenure your state has repeatedly added barriers to voting and      restricted access to the polls. For example, changes in 2011      significantly narrowed the early voting window that had      previously enabled thousands of Floridians to cast ballots.      As the three judge court in Florida v. United Stares, 885      2d 299 (D.D.2012), observed, the law threatened ``a      dramatic reduction in the form of voting that is      disproportionately used by African-Americans'' that would      have made it ``materially more difficult for some minority      voters to cast a ballot than under the benchmark law,'' in      part because the decreased opportunity for early voting would      produce increased lines at the polls during the remaining      hours. at 333. Accordingly, the court refused to approve      reduced early voting hours with respect to the five counties      in Florida covered by the Voting Rights Act's preclearance      provision.       Indeed, Florida's decision to reduce early voting      opportunities in the 2011 legislation was widely recognized      as a disaster. A report released by the Orlando Sentinel in      January 2013 found that at least 201,000 Florida voters did      not cast ballots on Election Day 2012 because they were      discouraged by long lines at polling places. I am pleased      that last year you signed legislation that restored early      voting days. However, I have grave concerns that there      remains a troubling pattern in your state of measures that      make it more difficult, not easier, for Floridians to vote.      For example, as part of the same 2011 law, the state imposed      rules on organizations that helped register individuals to      vote that were, in the words of a federal court, ``harsh,''      ``impractical,'' ``burdensome,'' and ``unworkable.'' League      of Women Voters of v. Browning, 863 2d 1155      (N.2012).       Most recently, the federal courts have concluded that in      2012, Florida violated the National Voter Registration Act of      1993 (NVRA) by conducting a systematic program to purge      voters from its voter registration rolls within the 90-day      quiet period before an election for federal office. In doing      so, Florida used inaccurate and unreliable voter verification      procedures that harmed and confused voters. Arcia v.      Sec'y, of State, 746 F.3d 1273 (11th 2014).       Florida is one of just eleven states that continue to      restrict voting rights even after a person has served his or      her sentence and is no longer on probation or parole; and in      2011, you made it more difficult for individuals who have      served their sentences to regain the right to vote by      eliminating automatic restoration of rights for non-violent      felons and requiring a five year waiting period before felons      convicted of non-violent crimes can apply to have their      rights restored. Approximately ten percent of the entire      population is disenfranchised as a result[[Page S947]]     of Florida law. The justifications for denying citizens'      voting rights for life, especially after they have completed      their sentence and made amends, are unpersuasive. On the      contrary: there is evidence to suggest that offenders whose      voting rights are restored are significantly less likely to      return to the criminal justice system. For example. a study      recently conducted by a parole commission in Florida found      that, while the overall three-year recidivism rate stood at      roughly 33 percent, the rate among those who were re-     enfranchised after they'd served their time was just a third      of that.       And there are a number of other troubling examples      involving recent changes:       In 2013, Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner issued a      directive to county officials who supervise elections stating      that they should never solicit the return of absentee ballots      at any place other than supervisors' offices. Many have      expressed concern that this directive will significantly      reduce the number of places to return an absentee ballot and      will have a negative impact on citizens whose jobs, access to      transportation, or addresses make it difficult to return      ballots to supervisors' office which, especially in large      counties, may be miles away.       This year, Gainesville, in an attempt to avoid the long      lines that characterized the 2012 election, sought approval      to use the University of Florida's student union as an early      voting site. Secretary of State Detzner denied the request.      As a result, it is more difficult for University of Florida      students--who have to travel to alternative early voting      locations miles off campus--to participate in early voting.       In April, it was reported that the Miami-Dade County      Elections Department had a policy, according to an email from      an Assistant County Attorney, ``not to permit access to      restrooms at polling sites on election days.'' As you know,      in 2012, Miami-Dade County had some of the longest lines and      waiting times to vote in the United Some voters      reported waiting as much as six hours. Many of the people      stuck in lines need to use bathroom facilities in order to      remain in line and be allowed to vote.       Whether or not these changes would ultimately be found to      violate specific federal laws, they represent a troubling      series of efforts to limit citizens' ability to exercise the      franchise. And I write to you today to make clear that the      Department of Justice is carefully monitoring jurisdictions      around the country--including throughout Florida--for voting      changes that may hamper the voting rights we are charged with      protecting. Whenever warranted by the facts and the law, we      will not hesitate to use all tools and legal authorities at      our disposal to fight against racial discrimination, to stand      against disenfranchisement, and to safeguard the right of      every eligible American to cast a ballot.           Sincerely,                                              Eric Holder, Jr.,                                                 Attorney  ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS873-2.txt,859,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,6.0,April
12338,topic-id,702,"The Attorney General cited problematic actions of the Governor's chief elections official, including purging from the voter rolls suspected noncitizens--a move that eventually was blocked after outright opposition from county election supervisors.  So in light of this evidence and following a widespread public outcry, what do we do now? As we say, it may not be as obvious as poll tactics and all the other blockades to voting, as we have seen in the past, particularly by all of the marches and so forth during the 1970s civil rights era. It might not be as obvious, but there are all these subtle attempts. So what do we do?  I submit that though the problem is complex, the answer is relatively simple. As Americans who cherish the right to vote, we must turn to those schemers and say: There is a promise of democracy that we will not allow you to break. We have an obligation to keep this promise of democracy for our children.  Congress may be dysfunctional, but we must continue to push lawmakers for a fix to the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court struck down on a 5-to-4 vote, a key provision. We ought to be making it easier to vote, not harder. I believe no one should have to wait more than one-half hour to vote.  So I joined with others a few years ago to introduce a bill in Congress aimed at making that standard 30-minute wait time based on the January 2014 recommendation of a bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Keep in mind what President Johnson said a half century ago: ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.''  Also remember what King said:       So long as I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the      right to vote, I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my      mind--it is made up for me. I cannot live as a democratic      citizen, observing the laws I have helped to enact--I can      only submit to the edict of others.  Don't we owe it to all our children the right to possess themselves if this is to be a truly free and fair democracy? I believe that two of the most fundamental rights in our democracy are the right to vote and the right to know whom you are voting for and the right to have the confidence that vote is going to be counted as you intended.  If that were not enough, just as concerning as the ongoing efforts to suppress certain votes in this country is the amount of undisclosed and unlimited money that is sloshing around in our campaigns.  The Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United has opened the floodgates and allowed the wealthiest Americans to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence our elections. Allowing such unlimited, undisclosed money into our political system is corrupting our democracy.  I have strongly supported several pieces of legislation, such as the Disclose Act, to require groups who spend more than $10,000 on campaign-related matters to identify themselves. Tell the people who is giving the money by filing a disclosure report with the Federal Elections But that is not what the Supreme Court decision required.  The American people have a right to know whom they are voting for--not just the name on the ballot but who is behind that name on the ballot. The Supreme Court itself said that ``transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.''  I believe we as a Congress have a moral obligation--a moral obligation--to correct what has happened to our system and to ensure that our voters have the information they need to make an informed decision on election day.  So this Senator has spoken on two subject areas--the right to vote and the amount of undetectable, unannounced, undisclosed, and unlimited money in our elections. For these and many other reasons I have stated and have not stated and the reasons mentioned in these remarks, I will vote no on the confirmation for Attorney  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner).

12318,topic-id,2298,"Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about Career and Technical Education The month of February has been set aside as Career and Technical Education It is an opportunity for us to talk about something that is working very well in some of our States and is giving our young people amazing opportunities, and it should be expanded.  Over the last 6 years, my home State of Ohio has come a long way. We have turned a record deficit into a billion-dollar rainy day fund. We have created lots of new jobs, but we also have a problem in Ohio and around the country, and that is a skills gap.  If you go on the www.ohiomeansjobs.com Web site right now, I think you will see about 122,000 jobs being offered. In other words, these are companies saying: We are looking for people.  At the same time, in Ohio today, we have about 280,000 people who are out of work. So how could that be, you ask? Well, if you look at the jobs and you look at what the descriptions are, many are jobs that require skills, and some of these skills are not available right now in the workforce. So you could get a lot of people put back to work just by developing these skills in  At the same time, this is happening around the country, and this skills gap--this mismatch between the skills that are in demand in a local economy and the skills of a worker--is something that can be dealt with with more aggressive career and technical education.  Businesses want to invest more. They want to make better products, but they[[Page S927]]can't do so if they can't find the right people.  By the way, when those skilled workers aren't available, often those jobs go somewhere else. So in the case of Ohio, some may go to other States--let's say Indiana--but some go to other countries--say  So if you don't have the skilled workforce, you are not going to be able to keep the jobs that we want here in America because workers are such a critical part of making a business successful.  The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the typical unemployed worker today has been unemployed for about 6 months. So we have this long-term unemployment again. The skills gap would help deal with that. There are 5.8 million Americans who are now stuck in part-time work who would want full-time work. So we have some challenges in our economy, and this skills training would really help.  According to a survey from Deloitte, 98 of the 100 biggest privately held employers in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH--98 out of 100--say they are struggling to find qualified workers. There is a shortage of machinists--machine operators. We are a manufacturing There is also a shortage of other jobs, IT skills, health care skills. Companies want to hire, but they have a hard time finding workers with the right skills.  By the way, it is not just in Cincinnati or in Ohio; it is across the country. There was a study done by the National Association of Manufacturers that found that three out of every four manufacturers say the skills gap is hurting their ability to expand and create more jobs. So as soon as this new Congress and new administration get to work, I think there is an opportunity for us to address this.  One thing we have heard about from the administration and also from both sides of the aisle here is the need for more infrastructure. We have all heard about the funding for our crumbling roads and bridges, our water systems, our waste water systems. I think that is all true, but it is going to be tough to do it because we don't have the skilled workers to rebuild the infrastructure. I think there is an area of common ground that if we have skilled workers, we will be much more likely to rebuild that infrastructure.  We had a conference on this issue a couple of weeks ago in Congress, and we brought people in from Ohio from the building trades. The point they made was: We would love to see this infrastructure expansion everybody is talking about. But who is going to do the work? We need more skills training, and we need to make sure that is there.  Yesterday afternoon we confirmed the Secretary of Education, Betsy One reason I voted for Betsy DeVos is that she talked about skills training. Her quote was that CTE, career technical education, is an ``important priority,'' and she agrees that we must do more to give our young people the job skills they need.  Some people, when they hear about CTE, wonder what it is. For some in my generation, it is what was called vocational education, but I will tell you that it is not your father's It is really impressive to go to these CTE schools and see what they are doing and see the changes in the attitudes of the kids and their parents once they get into these programs.  One of the challenges we have is getting kids to enroll in some of these CTE programs. Sometimes the parents say to their kids: That is not something you should do. You should get on track to go to college because that is the track we were on, and that is the track we were told was better. I will tell you that is a big mistake. Changing that attitude is really important to helping expand CTE because young people going into these CTE programs have an incredible opportunity. By the way, many of them do go on to college, 2- or 4-year institutions. Many of them also get a job out of high school, and, again, that job is very important to our employers keeping jobs and economic activity here in this country, but it is also a huge opportunity for them.  I was at a CTE center a couple of years ago. We were sitting around the table talking to some of the employers who were there supporting the programs, some of the administrators, and, of course most importantly, some of the students who were from three local high schools who were all involved in this CTE program. Of the three young people who were there, two of them were going off to manufacturing jobs where they were going to be making 50 grand a year plus benefits, and the third was going into an IT position where, again, she was going to have a great opportunity.  My question to the students was: Have you gone back to your high school and talked to your friends about this? They all indicated they were planning to do that because they had a great experience. They had great opportunities. By the way, one of them was interested in being an engineer. He was going to CTE and then going to get a job. He had a job lined up with a company he had interned for, but that same company was willing to send him to school to get a degree in engineering over the subsequent years.  All three of them had college credits already because in Ohio students are allowed to get college credits from CTE courses, which makes it more likely that they will graduate but also more likely that they will be able to get to college and have college be more affordable by getting credits in advance. It is a terrific idea.  There is a story that I heard about recently of a young woman in Her name is Mackenzie Slicker from Massilon, She will tell you that she was not doing very well in school. She was not hitting her marks, and she was not very excited about school. Then one day she saw there was an opportunity to get into a CTE course in sports medicine. She applied for it. The teacher looked at her scores in other classes and non-CTE classes, and said: I will take a chance on you, but I am concerned about you because your grades are so low. But she applied. She said she was embarrassed by those scores. The teacher let her in with the understanding that she would do a better job in her other classes. The CTE course gave her a totally new-found motivation to work hard and get good grades.  I hear this again and again back home. These kids from CTE are excited. They not only stay in school--they are not dropouts--but they do better.  In her senior year in high school she had a 4.0 after getting into the CTE program for sports medicine. She is studying at Miami University where she is on track for living out her dream of becoming an orthopedic surgeon. That is an example of how CTE really works.  Senator Tim Kaine and I had this in mind when we started the Senate CTE It is a caucus that started with just a couple of Members, and now it has a strong following. Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin is among the leaders of that caucus, and she is on the floor today. This caucus not only has these conferences that bring people together to talk about issues, but we also put together legislation.  Senator Kaine and I introduced legislation called Jumpstart Our Businesses by Supporting Students Act, or the JOBS We tried hard to get that acronym, We introduced it a couple weeks ago. It would let low-income people get Pell grants for job training programs. Under current law, financial aid for programs can be used for courses lasting 15 weeks or more, but a lot of the licensing programs and the job training programs are less than 15 weeks. In Ohio a lot of them are 9 weeks. So we think this legislation will be helpful, giving young people options that they don't have now to be able to have this funding to be able to give them opportunities for a better start in their careers, getting them the licensing they need, the certificates they need, and putting them on the path to joining the middle class and the ability to get a job, but also to be able to buy that car, to be able to buy that home over time by having this opportunity to get skills training.  Our legislation has been endorsed by education groups like the Association of Career and Technical Education, the National Skills Coalition, the National Council for Workforce Education, and many other groups. We appreciate their help, and we are going to get that legislation done.  I hope colleagues from both sides of the aisle can join us to get that legislation enacted. It makes so much sense.[[Page S928]]  Senator Kaine and I are also planning to reintroduce another bill called Educating Tomorrow's Workforce Act, which improves the quality of our CTE programs by setting minimum standards for CTE programs that would ensure students are able to transfer their credits, be able to have their work graded today based on today's industry standards, and use equipment that is up to date. So basically it is legislation--and again I thank Senator Baldwin for her support--to help increase the quality of CTE education. In some of our States this is working incredibly well. Ohio is one of those cutting-edge We have to ensure that the standards are maintained and expanded everywhere and we continue to support reauthorization to strongly support our CTE programs.  Just like the JOBS Act, this bill has been endorsed by a number of education experts and groups, and we appreciate their help, including the National Career Academy Coalition, the National Career Development Association, National Association of Secondary School Principals, and many more.  In Ohio we have some great schools, whether it is Cleveland, OH--the Max Hayes High School does an awesome job. I was there for its opening, now about a year and a half ago, and they are doing a terrific job of working with the building trades, working with private industry, working with the high schools in the area, and developing skills that are badly needed in Northeast Ohio also has some great health care CTE programs. I mentioned the young woman who found her motivation getting involved in CTE for sports medicine.  Recently I went to Butler Tech to their health care campus, which is north of Cincinnati, and what they are doing there is amazing. You walk in and all the kids have on their white medical coats, and whether they are dental hygienists who are being trained or technologists or students who plan to go to medical school someday or those who are interested in getting a degree in nursing, there are some incredible sites. They have brought in outside partners, all from the area, who are involved with working with them. It is good for our kids but also really good for our community.  Mr.President, if we pass this legislation that I am talking about today, if we continue to focus on career and technical education as we are supposed to do this month--CTE month, February--we are going to help many millions of our young people to be able to have better opportunities and, most importantly, we are going to be able to help our economy. We are going to help create more jobs and more opportunities in this country, to be able to close that skills gap, to put people back to work. It makes too much sense for us not to come together as Republicans and Democrats alike, and with the new administration, to promote career and technical education.  With that I yield my time.

12195,topic-id,1119,"Mr.Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and my partner in this Special Order hour, Congresswoman Jayapal from the State of Washington, I rise to discuss the imminent Senate filibuster against President Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme  Ordinarily, a Supreme Court nomination like this would be an all-consuming public matter. It has gotten a little bit less attention because there is so much going on all over the globe. The world is on fire today. We see outrageous atrocities taking place in Syria under the so-called leadership of President We see here in America a government in turmoil, as every day the curtain is drawn back just a little bit further on the Russian connection with the Trump White  But we do need to take some time to focus on the U.Supreme Court if for no other reason than what we have in America today is one-party control of the U.House of Representatives, the U.Senate, the White House, and, if the Supreme Court goes, too, we essentially have no meaningful multiparty democracy in terms of the essential governance of the country.  Now, as the Senate takes up the President's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Court, I have heard a number of officials and commentators criticize the effort taking place in the Senate over the last few days and into the next few days to stop I have heard them criticize it by invoking the aphorism ``two wrongs don't make a right.'' Of course, they are referring to the fact that President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, the Chief Judge of the D.Circuit Court of Appeals to the U.Supreme Court, was stonewalled for 9 months in the last year of President Obama's  Judge Garland didn't even receive a hearing. It never got to the point that there was a vote. He would have loved the opportunity to have someone filibuster his nomination on the floor of the His nomination never got to the floor of the He never had a hearing in committee--completely unprecedented in our history simply to stonewall, obstruct, and sandbag a judicial nominee like this. I will have something to say about the qualifications of Judge  But, in any event, the Democrats now are saying: We are not going to proceed with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch; we are going to block it. In answer, I hear repeatedly from U.Senators and commentators this phrase: Two wrongs don't make a right. Of course, that truism is true. But what does this excellent piece of folk wisdom have to do with the current situation of the nomination of Gorsuch to the Supreme Court?  If you saw someone punching out a security guard and running into a bank to rob the bank, it would be legally and morally wrong for you to go punch out another security guard at a bank across the street and go rob that bank. Two wrongs, indeed, do not make a right. You don't solve one bank robbery by committing another. But if you saw someone punching out a security guard and running into a bank to go rob it and you decided to run after the robber, pounce on him, and punch him out, that would be completely legally and morally justified.  In other words, stopping the original wrong is not in itself a wrong. Stopping the original wrong is right. That is the right thing to do, and that is what the Democrats are doing. They are trying to block a crime in progress because, understand, we have never, in American history, seen something like a President send a nomination to the Supreme Court to the U.Senate to fill a seat probably for 20 or 30 years and the Senate just says simply: We are not going to have any hearings about it. That is exactly what they did to Judge Merrick                              {time}  1715  Let me just say a few words about him before I turn it over to my colleague, Congresswoman  Judge Garland is, arguably, one of the two or three most experienced and qualified judges ever to be nominated to the Supreme He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College and magna cum laude from Harvard Law  After serving as a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly of the U.Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and then Justice William Brennan on the U.Supreme Court, he practiced law at Arnold & Porter here in Washington; and he worked as a Federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice, where he played a leading role in the investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers and the investigation and prosecution of Ted Kaczynski, the  He has had nearly 20 years of judicial experience on the D.Circuit Court of The Senate originally confirmed him in an overwhelming 76-23 vote, where he not only swept the Democratic Caucus in the Senate, but won the majority of Republicans when he first went on the court.  His nomination to the Supreme Court fell victim to the GOP Senate leadership's rule-or-ruin mentality that is ravaging the most basic norms of American political democracy in this century. If Garland could not be confirmed to the U.Supreme Court, then no moderate liberal judge can be.  Some people have suggested that Gorsuch should be filibustered for exactly 9 months, which is the length of time that the GOP used to run out the clock on the Merrick Garland nomination. In other words, he was blockaded for 9 months. Therefore, blockade Gorsuch for 9 months, then have a vote on him.  This apparently symmetrical answer would certainly make President Trump's nominee twist in the wind and suffer the way that President Obama's nominee twisted in the wind and suffered, but that is not the point. It is not to inflict pain on the nominee. The real problem is not 9 months of legislative obstructionism, much less retribution for what was inflicted on one judge.  The real question is: Who gets to have the seat on the Supreme Court?  It is about the next 25 years of Supreme Court decisionmaking. That seat, by all rights, belongs not to Judge Gorsuch, but, rather, to Judge Merrick  Judge Gorsuch, however qualified he might be in terms of his own career, would present a jurisprudence dramatically to the right of the jurisprudence that would clearly be advanced by the addition of Judge Garland to the court. That is what we are going to talk about tonight.  I am going to begin by turning it over to a great champion of justice, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights for all the people, my distinguished colleague and the vice chair of the Progressive  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2741-2.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,5.0,March

12199,topic-id,272,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for those excellent comments. As we have been discussing this evening, there is an egregious process problem with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, and there is an egregious substantive problem with it.  The process problem, of course, is that the seat properly belongs to Judge Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the D.Circuit Court of Appeals, who was denied, extraordinarily, even a hearing for a 9-month period. The justification for that offered by Senator McConnell was that he felt that the people should speak in the 2016 election. Of course, President Obama was The Senate was the The people had spoken in the 2012 and 2014 elections. But they said they wanted the people to speak.  Well, the interesting thing, of course, is that the people spoke, and 2.9 million more people voted for the candidate who said she would appoint someone to the Court who was pro-choice, pro-Bill of Rights, pro-civil liberties, and not the Justice promised by Donald Trump, someone who would reverse Roe v. Wade and stand by Citizens United and the corporatization of the Supreme So the people spoke.  The other problem, the substantive problem, is that Judge Gorsuch adds to what has come to be called the corporate majority on the corporate Corporations win; workers lose.[[Page H2744]]Corporations win; investors lose. Corporations win; consumers lose. Time after time in the Roberts Court, the jurisprudence of the Court is defined by the identity of the parties, which is completely antithetical to our whole concept of rule of law and constitutional justice.

12200,topic-id,1562,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for those extraordinary comments. Congresswoman Lee makes me think about the partisan identification of Supreme Court nominees because it is a relatively recent phenomena that we identify them as Democrats or  Many of my favorite Supreme Court Justices were appointed to the Supreme Court by Republican Justice Suitor, of course, was appointed by the first President He was an exceptional Justice, who earned the ire, unfortunately, of the Republicans because he voted with the majority in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, affirming a woman's right to choose an abortion in consultation with her physician and her family and because he voted in Lee v. Weisman to prevent religious prayers from taking place at public school graduation ceremonies.  The rhetoric then in the Republican Party was, ``No more Suitors,'' despite the fact that he had been nominated by a Republican ``No more Suitors'' is what they said.  Or Justice Kennedy, who has been an exceptional Justice when it comes to vindicating the constitutional rights and equality of the LGBT He was the one who authored the decision in Lawrence v. Texas, overruling Bowers v. Hardwick, saying that the State of Texas and other States could not arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate gay people simply for their relationships. He wrote that.[[Page H2745]]  He also was the author of the Supreme Court's magnificent decision in the Obergefell case, determining that equal protection means that States cannot discriminate against gay and lesbian citizens in the institution of marriage--and there is no going back on that.  But, of course, the rhetoric on the other side now, because it has got to be turned into a partisan football, is, ``No more Kennedys.'' ``No more Kennedys.'' ``No more Suitors.'' Why? Because they did their jobs as ``We want people like Neil Gorsuch who are going to tow the line every step along the way.''  Neil Gorsuch is someone that they are convinced will be part of both the attempt to dramatically reduce or abolish the privacy rights of the people, turn the clock back on the equal rights of the LGBT community but, also, more importantly, participate in what has been called the development of the corporate court Neil  Now, that is a long-running development. But the critical moment came in 2010 with the Citizens United decision. Understand, the traditional doctrine for two centuries was that a corporation is, in the words of Chief Justice John Marshall from the 1819 decision in the Dartmouth College v. Woodward case, he said, ``an artificial being, invisible, intangible, existing only in contemplation of law,'' not possessing the constitutional political rights of the people. But in Citizens United, a deeply divided 5-4 Supreme Court found for the first time in our history that for-profit business corporations enjoy the political free speech rights of the people.  So what did that mean as a practical matter? Because, after all, before, the CEOs could spend whatever they wanted of their own money independently in a political campaign--see Buckley v. Valeo; the members of the board, the corporate executives, could spend whatever they wanted independently in a political campaign--see Buckley v. Valeo; they could contribute up to the limits--see Buckley v. Valeo; now they can contribute to every Member of Congress and every Member of Congress' opponent because of a recent decision handed down by the Supreme  But there is one thing they couldn't do: The CEOs could not take money directly out of the corporate treasury to spend in politics. But the Citizens United majority gave them that power.  This breached an understanding that had been in place for centuries that the most conservative Justices on the Court adhered to. Chief Justice Rehnquist, a very conservative judge, said that corporations are magnificent vehicles for the accumulation and investment of wealth, and they have worked great for the economy, but they are very dangerous if you allow them to cross the line from economics to politics.  Justice White, a very conservative Justice, appointed by a Democrat, President Kennedy, said that corporations are endowed with all kinds of special attributes, like perpetual life of the corporation, the limited liability of the shareholders, and all kinds of legal trappings and subsidies. He said: The corporation is the creature of the State, and the State need not permit its own creature to consume it, to devour it.  So we had a doctrine, which is that corporations could be confined to the economic realm. They could not convert all of the wealth and power they accumulate in economics into political power. But that is what the Supreme Court did in Citizens  But it didn't stop there. Because now the question became, as the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals put it: If a corporation has political rights, if a for-profit business corporation has political rights, why doesn't a for-profit business corporation have the religious rights of the people? And that became the Hobby Lobby decision in 2014.  Hobby Lobby was a for-profit business corporation, not a religious entity, not a church, not a mosque. It was a business corporation. And it was not organized for religious purposes. It was organized for profitmaking purposes. Yet the corporate leadership said: We don't want to participate in the provision of contraceptive care for our employees under the Affordable Care We don't want to do that. We assert the religious rights of the corporation.  Now, stop and think about that for a second. From the standpoint of most religions, it is pure blasphemy to say that a corporation should have religious rights. As James Madison put it back when he wrote his famous remonstrance against religious taxation: The religious rights of the people are sacred in our system because they are between the person and God, they are between the believer and The government doesn't get involved; corporations aren't involved; and all of these other artificial entities aren't involved. It is between the person and his or her religious faith or worship.  But beyond the blasphemy of it, think about what this means. What it means is that a business corporation can say that it does not want to participate in the provision of contraceptives to their employees, thereby violating the rights of their employees.  If a corporation can exercise its newly found religious conscience to say that it doesn't want to provide contraceptives to employees, why can't the corporations say: Well, it also violates our rights to compel us to serve people on an interfaith or interracial basis; that offends our religious beliefs, too, as a corporation? Where does this doctrine end?  Now, why do we raise this? Because Judge Gorsuch was part of the majority which determined that corporations have a religious conscience, have a religious soul. He has been part of the spiritual ennoblement of business corporations to the detriment of workers and consumers and other people who have to deal with this newfound corporate power.  Judge Gorsuch seems like a good guy. He is right out of central casting, but he is being put on the Court to participate in the greatest concentration of corporate power, jurisprudence, and thinking on the Supreme Court in its entire history, with the possible exception of the Lochner period. Of course, in the Lochner period, in the early 20th century, the Supreme Court began to slash away at child labor laws, at laws protecting the rights of people to belong to unions, at any kind of social regulation, saying that violated due process.  Well, today, the First Amendment, where religious freedom played the same role that due process played during the Lochner period, they become a catchall rubric for the Court to strike down the laws of the people and to benefit big corporate power against the rights of actual human beings, like the people who lost their contraceptive care in the Hobby Lobby case because some of the corporate lawyers representing Hobby Lobby had the bright idea to assert that the corporation was protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration And, of course, Judge Gorsuch went along for the ride, with all of the other corporate judges and the justices on the corporate court.  Mr.Speaker, there is one category of judges in our Federal judiciary that merit the Appalachian Justice, who are called ``Justice.'' Everybody else is called ``Your Honor'' or ``Judge.'' But the people who go on the Supreme Court get to be called ``Justice.'' It means something.                              {time}  1800  There is a massive injustice taking place here because of the outrageous sandbagging, stonewalling, and obstruction of the D.Circuit Court Chief Judge Merrick Garland, who was denied even a hearing in the U.Now there is an attempt to tilt the Court for the next 15, 20, or 30 years with the appointment of Judge Gorsuch to the corporate bloc.  So here in the House of Representatives, of course, we do not enjoy the power of advice and consent; but a number of us simply wanted to say this evening that we stand very strongly in solidarity with those Members of the Senate who are exercising their constitutional duties by trying to filibuster this nomination, which is conceived in a wrong, in an attempt to steal a Supreme Court seat and, if it were to be accomplished, would be destined simply to add to a rightwing pro-corporate majority on the Roberts  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2741-2.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,5.0,February

I am deeply concerned, however, that he cannot be the effective check on the Executive Branch that our nation currently needs.  In just the short time since President Donald Trump took office, our Nation has faced upheaval and challenges to the way our government typically runs. The President's unprecedented refusal to divest himself of his business holdings while in office has created legal and constitutional conflicts that are unique in our Nation's history. His use of social media to antagonize American businesses has already caused needless volatility in our economy, which is the cornerstone of global financial stability. Most recently, he has unilaterally enacted a ban on travel to the United States from several Muslim-majority countries--creating chaos in airports, separating families, and tarnishing our Nation's image around the world. It is of great concern to me that Senator Sessions has already stated his unwillingness, if confirmed, to recuse himself from investigations into potentially unlawful activities of the Trump campaign and Trump administration.  Moreover, Senator Sessions and I disagree on how the law should treat immigrants, refugees, the LGBTQ community, women, and racial minorities, among others. These disagreements go to the heart of the Justice Department's law enforcement and civil rights functions. For instance, in 2013, Senator Sessions voted against a bipartisan effort to reform our Nation's immigration laws. This effort garnered overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle and would have done much to address the immigration problems facing us today. He also voted against the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which provides much-needed support to and protections for some of the most vulnerable people in our communities--and is overseen by the Justice Department that he hopes to administer. Additionally, his statements and votes in opposition to reaffirming the prohibition on torture run counter to our values and basic precepts of international law. And he has voted against every recent effort in this Chamber to establish the most basic, commonsense laws that would keep our communities safe from the threat of gun violence. He also has called into question the Voting Rights Act and praised the Supreme Court's harmful decision striking down a key section of this law.  These are just some of the clear disagreements I have with the positions Senator Sessions has taken over the years, which cause me to doubt his ability to effectively lead the Justice Our next Attorney General should be a champion for all Americans' civil rights and civil liberties.

12320,topic-id,579,"Mr.President, I rise today regarding the upcoming confirmation on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be Attorney General of the United For the past 3 years, I have had the great pleasure of working with Senator Sessions in this body. We served together on both the Senate Armed Services and Environment and Public Works Within those committees, as well as on other issues that have come before the Senate during that same time period, I have found that Senator Sessions is extremely forthright, hard-working, and Senator Sessions is honest. He has served Alabamans and all Americans well during his 20 years in the U. In addition to serving on the Armed Services and EPW Committees, he also serves on the Senate Judiciary and Budget Committees, all of which address vital aspects of our Federal system.  Senator Sessions also had a distinguished career before he was elected the U.Senator from After graduating from the University of Alabama with a law degree, Senator Sessions practiced law in Russellville and Mobile, In 1975, he took the oath to defend the Constitution of the United States as an assistant U.attorney--the first step in a long and honorable career as a prosecutor. In 1981, Senator Sessions was nominated by President Reagan and confirmed by the U.Senate as the U.Attorney for the Southern District of He served honorably in that role for 12 years. Senator Sessions was then elected Alabama attorney general and served in that role until his election to the U. It is clear to me that Senator Sessions is exceptionally and perhaps uniquely qualified to serve as the Attorney General for the United He served as a line prosecutor and, as U.attorney and Alabama attorney general, as the chief Federal and State law enforcement authority. He has personally handled or managed a wide variety of cases--criminal and civil, trial and appellate. Senator Sessions also has extensive experience in the Federal system and, as a former State attorney general, a deep respect for State and local law enforcement and the role of States in our Federal system.  There is an attribute even more important than experience, in my opinion, and that is integrity. Over the course of his career, Senator Sessions has demonstrated a deep respect for the Constitution and the rule of law, and ultimately, I believe that is what is most important in an Attorney General of the United  In 1935, the U.Supreme Court wrote this about the role of a U.attorney, and I think it applies similarly to the Attorney General:       A federal prosecutor ``is the representative not of an      ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose      obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its      obligation to govern at all and whose interest, therefore, in      a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but      that justice be done.''  The Supreme Court continued:       [A]s such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the      servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt      shall not escape or innocence suffer.  I support Senator Sessions as Attorney General of the United States not only because his experience makes him qualified to serve but more importantly because his character makes him qualified to serve. Senator Sessions will, in the words of the Supreme Court, be a certain ``servant of the law'' and will make certain that justice is done for all  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

12345,topic-id,4348,"Mr.President, first, I do appreciate the words of my colleague from Colorado, and I thank him for them, and that topic deserves more discussion on the floor of the  One of the things that always gives me extraordinary pride to be an American and to be a Member of the Senate is the realization--as I sat here today and listened to my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Scott--that neither my ancestors nor his were participants in terms of structuring this Yet this Republic is so grand that it has plenty of room for people like me and him and so many others participating--including here, as one of only 100 Americans who are entrusted with the responsibility of representing our States and also upholding our Constitution in this body.  The Senator from Colorado is also right in talking about the role of the Senate not just in terms of passing laws but in conducting oversight irrespective of who occupies the White It is a difficult thing to do these days because everything in American politics is covered through the lens of politics and of elections. Almost immediately, whatever I say here on the floor today will be analyzed through the lens and construct of elections past and elections future. What is he trying to achieve or what are any of us trying to achieve politically? There is a place for that. I think we are not foolish enough to believe there is no politics in politics.  There is also something that is incredibly important, and that is the Constitution that every single one of us is sworn to uphold. It is a pledge I again took recently on these very steps a few feet away from where I stand here now a few weeks ago.  Part of that is, in fact, to oversee the foreign policy conduct of the United As many of us are aware, there has been recent discussion in some circles, including in my party, about a desire to achieve a better relationship with Vladimir Putin and with By the way, I share that goal. I think it would be good for the world if the United States and Russia had a better relationship and, in particular, with the Russian people, with whom we have no quarrel. I also think we have a responsibility to understand what the obstacles are to better relations.  It is in that context that I come to the floor of the Senate today because I had a lot of people ask me over the last week, over the last few months: Why is it that you have such views about our relationships with Russia on the way forward?  I want to take a moment to discuss that in the broader context, with everything else that is happening here now. Even as we work through these nominations, the world continues to turn, and events around the world continue to have an impact on us here.  Let me begin by saying this. I don't think this is a fact that can be disputed. Vladimir Putin today has amassed more power in Moscow and Russia than any leader in Russia in about 60 years, if not longer. He used to maintain that power through a pretty straightforward deal that he had with both elites and the broader society.  Here is the deal he used to have with them. The deal was this: I will help you--especially the elites--make a lot of money and become very wealthy, and I will help society at-large by helping to grow our economy. In return, however, I need complete power and complete control of the government.  That was basically the arrangement he had up until just a few years ago when a combination of falling oil prices and economic decline forced them into a different direction. The new model that Vladimir Putin is now pursuing in Russia is one in which he is basically trying to gin up and rally public support, and he is largely doing it through a foreign policy which is aggressive and which is designed to create an impression among the Russian people that Russia has now been restored to great power status--a status equal or on par with that of the United  The first thing we have to understand is that much of what Vladimir Putin does is not in pursuit of an ideology, like the Soviet Union did. It is about domestic politics in Russia and about needing the Russian people to believe that he and his strength are essential to what Russia has. So much of it is about that.  What are the prongs of the strategy? The first is that he has sought to make their military modern and strong, and you see evidence of that in the fact that while Russia is going through crippling budget cuts as a result of a downturn in the global economy, oil prices falling, and sanctions against the Putin government, they are increasing defense spending. They are modernizing. They are adding capabilities. They are, for the first time, although in a limited way, beginning to conduct naval exercises and projection of power in places they hadn't been in for 25 years or longer.  The second is a crackdown in internal dissent. For that, I think the evidence is overwhelming. I know we have all heard recently about the case of Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a Russian political opposition leader. He is a vocal critic of Vladimir He works at something called the Open Russia Foundation, an organization of activists who call for open elections, a free press, and civil rights reforms in  This is an interesting thing to talk about because there has been a lot of discussion on this floor a moment ago about the press and a lot of discussion about elections, of course, over the last year and longer. There has been a lot of discussion about civil rights. Think about this. This is what the Open Russia Foundation works for and on behalf of in  In America, when you believe that civil rights are being violated at this moment in our history or you think the election system isn't working the way it should or you are defending the press, as my colleagues have done here today in the right of a free press, you have a bad blog post written about you, someone may run against you for office, cable commentators will say nasty things about you from the other side, maybe somebody will stand up on the floor and criticize you for this or that.  Let me tell you what happens when you do that in They poison you. Kara-Murza is believed to have been poisoned in February 2017; after he experienced organ failure, and he is currently in the hospital--just this month. This comes 2 years after another suspected poisoning that nearly killed him in May 2015.  I want to take a moment to urge the administration to do everything in their power to ensure that he is receiving the medical care he needs and to help determine who was behind the latest apparent attempt against him.  If this was an isolated case, you would say: Well, maybe something else happened. There is an incredible number of critics of Vladimir Putin that wind up poisoned, dead, shot in the head in their hotel room, found in the street, and other things.  In other instances, just today we have this article from the Wall Street Journal about someone who was thinking about running against Vladimir Alexei Navalny was thinking about running for  So what happens in America when somebody thinks you are going to run for President? They do an opposition research file. They plant negative stories about you. They start badmouthing you on cable news. That is unpleasant, no doubt. He was found guilty by a kangaroo court of corruption, which, of course, according to Russian law, finds him and blocks him from running in next year's Presidential election.  Again, if this were an isolated case, you would say: Maybe this guy did[[Page S955]]something wrong. The problem is, just about anyone who is either thinking about running for office or challenging Putin winds up poisoned, dead, in jail, or charged and convicted of a crime.  The second thing he has done is just completely crack down on all internal dissent. There is no free press in I would venture to guess that if I controlled 80 to 90 percent of the press reported about me, I would probably have approval ratings in the eighties and nineties as well. That is a pretty good deal for the leader but not for the people.  The third thing that is part of this effort is that they are basically doing everything they can--Vladimir Putin--to undermine the international order that is built on democracy and respect for human rights. I think the example of that is in various places.  Look at what has happened in Vladimir Putin gets involved in Syria, not because he cares about humanitarian crises--because, in fact, Russian forces have conducted airstrikes in civilian areas. We have seen the images. It is undeniable that it happened. It is by every definition of the word a war crime to target civilians with military weaponry.  That is what has happened in But for Vladimir Putin, it has been successful because his engagement basically changes the conflict. He now has positioned himself in the eyes of the Russian people and many people around the world as a power broker in the Middle East--in fact, as an alternative to the United States in that region.  This is part of his strategy. It wasn't about Syria as much as it was about his goal of being able to go to the Russian people and say that we matter again on the global stage. In Ukraine, there was talk about moving toward the European Union in terms of economic relations. There was talk about joining Then he invaded Crimea, and he kept it. He has funded separatists forces in eastern There is no more talk of NATO, and there is no more talk of unifying the economy with Europe, and they kept The last few days we are starting to read open press reports of mobilization and unusual activity among eastern Ukrainian separatists backed, supported, trained, and equipped by the Russians, and we fear that new fighting could be imminent at any moment once again.  Then we have all heard the discussions about the elections in the United States and the efforts of other governments to not just hack computers. It is not about hacking alone. It is about the strategic placing of information, gathered through cyber intrusion, for the purposes of undermining political candidates and, therefore, influencing the election.  There was something deeper here. It was part of a broader effort to discredit our Republic and our democracy, to be able to go back to the Russian people and to the broader world and say that the American political system is corrupt. The American political system is not a true democracy. The American political system is as bad as all these other systems in the world that they criticize. They do not come to this with clean hands.  I often wonder sometimes if we contribute to that argument in the way we behave toward one another in our political discourse in this country. That is something to think about in the long term. I hope people understand that as we engage in these political debates in this country, these things are being viewed around the world. For people who may not have a clear perspective, or if this information is being used negatively--by no means am I saying that we should not have vibrant debate in this country; we should, but I also want people to understand--that oftentimes gives off the perception that, in fact, our Republic is on the verge of collapse.  We are in challenging times. We have some strong disagreements, and oftentimes they become heated. I know for a fact that there isn't a single Member of this body prepared to walk away from the Constitution or the liberties that it protects and are enshrined therein.  By the way, I don't believe Vladimir Putin is done in this effort. I think you are now going to see him continue to interfere in He can use that as leverage against the gulf kingdoms, against the  I think you are going to see him continue to engage in He will go to the Egyptians and say: The Americans are always hassling you about human rights. Why don't you just buy your weapons from us? Why don't you give us a military base? We are never going to give you grief about human rights. We are a much easier and low-maintenance partner.  I wouldn't even be surprised to see him start dabbling in Afghanistan with the Taliban, in some capacity anyway, and couch it in terms of fighting  We will see. My point is, it is not done. I bring all that up in the context of this suggestion among some, and I think it is important to talk about it because I don't think we should dismiss viewpoints. There are some, including in the administration, who believe that maybe we can do a deal with Vladimir Putin where he helps us fight against ISIS and in return we lift sanctions. The argument that I hear from people is this: Why wouldn't we want better relations with Vladimir Putin and enlist them in the fight against ISIS?  I come here today in the context of everything I have laid out to tell you why I think that is unrealistic and deeply problematic.  Here is 1. Why do we have to do a deal with Vladimir Putin to fight ISIS? He already claims that he is. In fact, that is the way he describes their operations in Syria--as an anti-terror operation. There is no more dangerous terrorist group in the world today than There is certainly no more dangerous terrorist group in the world today than There is certainly no more dangerous and capable a terrorist group in Syria today than  Isn't that what he is already doing? Why would we then have to cut a deal to encourage him to do what he claims to already be doing? There are only two reasons. Either 1, we think he should do more, which in and of itself tells you that he is not doing it; or 2, because he is not doing it now.  Here is the second problem: this argument that as part of this whole effort with Russia, one of the things we would be able to achieve is to break them from the Iranians, to create some sort of split between the Russians and the  I saw an article the other day talking about that as part of this endeavor. My argument to you is that we don't really need to do that. That is going to happen on its own. Say what you want, as soon as ISIS is destroyed in Syria and Iraq or in both, the Iranians are going to immediately not just push to drive the Americans out of the region but drive the Russians out as well.  The Iranians are not interested in replacing American influence in the region with Russian influence. They want to be the hegemonic power in the region. As to this argument that we somehow can peel them apart, my friends, that is going to happen all on its own. If we abandon there tomorrow, the Iranians would immediately turn to driving the Russians out as well because they want to be the hegemonic power. They have long desired to be the hegemonic power in the region. That is going to put them in conflict with the Russians sooner rather than later at some point here, at least to some level.  The third thing I think we have to understand is that there is absolutely no pressure, no political rationale why Vladimir Putin needs a better relationship with the United States at this time, at least not politically. He is not going to lose an election, because if you run against him, you go to jail. He controls the press. He controls the political discourse in the country. So one of the reasons we should always be advocates for democracy is because democratic leaders act much more responsibly because they have to answer to their people, but in essence that is not what you have in There is really no reason or rationale why he would be pressured to have a better relationship with us.  Do the Russian people want a better relationship with America? I have no doubt about that, but I want you to understand that everything they learn about our relationship with them is largely derived through the Russian press. If you never had the pleasure of watching, for example, the RT Network on television, and you are interested in comedy and satire, I encourage you to tune into that station from time to time so you can see an alternative representation of events that would startle you, and perhaps make you laugh.[[Page S956]]This is unfortunately the sort of media information that filters to the Russian people that Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin completely control.  Here is the fourth and perhaps most important reason I think this endeavor is unrealistic and perhaps even counterproductive. The price you would have to pay is simply too high in return for the alleged benefit that would come about.  1, the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin has basically violated every agreement they have made now and in the past. They are violating the cease-fire. They violated all sorts of arrangements with regard to arms reductions, and they will continue to do that in any deal anyone cuts with him.  The second is one of the first things he is going to ask for is the lifting of all sanctions for both Ukraine and interference in our elections, in return for no changes to the status in Ukraine and no promise of not undertaking efforts like what happened here in the future.  The third thing they are going to demand is recognition of a Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, especially in places that are now countries that were once part of the Soviet In essence, a United States acceptance officially or otherwise that there are countries in the world who are not allowed to enter into economic or military engagements with the United States unless Russia allows it.  You think about that. They are basically going to ask us to play some game of geopolitical chess, where we basically turn over the sovereignty and future of other Nations and say to them there are these countries in the world, and we are not going to try to do anything with them, economic, political, cultural, socially or militarily, unless you give us permission to do so. This would be a requirement. It is one of the things he insists upon.  He would also require the United States to support pulling back NATO troops and equipment and personnel and operations from Nations in Europe, which would be devastating to the NATO alliance, which one of his other goals is to render NATO feckless and irrelevant.  I just don't think that is a price worth paying in exchange for alleged cooperation against ISIS--that he claims to already be conducting--and in exchange for basically sending a message to the world that America is your ally, unless there is a better deal with us for someone else. That would be devastating. What do I think we should do, and what I hope the Senate will do, if there is an effort now or any time in the future, by anyone, to change or conduct a deal of this magnitude?  I think the first thing we need to do is be committed to the principle. These sanctions that are in place should remain in place until the conditions in those sanctions are met, until the sovereignty of Ukraine is respected, and until these efforts to undermine democracy and spread misinformation are fully accounted for.  The second is, I think it is important for us to reaffirm our commitment to NATO, and that includes the building up of defenses and exercises, that we continue to do that firmly, not just with our NATO allies but with any nation who seeks cooperation with us.  The third is careful but strategic engagement in the Middle East to the Iraqis, to make very clear that the United States will continue to be their partner after ISIS falls; that we want Iraq to be prosperous and free and that we believe it is better for the world and we are prepared to help them achieve that.  To the Egyptians, we will continue to press them on human rights, and we should. We should also be willing at the same time--and, by the way, with the argument that respecting human rights is actually good for Egypt, that in the long term these conditions that exist will lead to constant threats to their government, but we can do that while at the same time continuing to partner with them on military sales. I think they would welcome a conversation about trade and potentially a bilateral trade agreement with them about opening up avenues for business investment and so forth.  The fourth is to point out that if they are not going after ISIS, then what exactly are they doing now? It is important for us to point that out to the world. Again, I made this point numerous times. I want to make it once again; this idea that we are going to get them to cooperate much more against ISIS basically implies they are not doing it now, but they claim that is why they are in Syria to begin with.  Finally, I think it is important for us to try to communicate directly with the Russian people to the extent possible. It is hard to do because the Russian Government, under Putin, also controls the Internet with filters and the like. It is important for us to say our quarrel is not with the Russian people; that for many years up until this unfortunate turn of events over the last decade, the links with the United States and the Russian people grew strong and those links remain.  In my home State of Florida, there is a significant number of Russians who live in Florida part time and so forth. I hope that will continue. Our quarrel is not with the Russian people, and we desire for Russia to be powerful and influential in the world. We want Russia to be prosperous. This country does not view this as a zero-sum gain. In order for America to be influential, Russia must be less influential.  Our quarrel is not with Russia but a leader who does view it as a zero-sum gain, a leader who believes the only way Russia can be more important is for America to be less important, a leader who has chosen to try to undermine an international order based on democracy and free enterprise and human rights that has kept the world out of a third world war, and I think it is important for us to do that.  I think that is important and why we need at least to be prepared in this body, if necessary, to move forward with legislation that doesn't just codify existing sanctions but that prevents the lifting of those sanctions, unless the conditions in those sanctions are met. This is our job. It is true that Presidents and administrations have an obligation, a duty, and a right to set the foreign policies of the United There is no doubt about it. I think that is true, no matter who is the  But it would be a mistake, and in my opinion, a dereliction of duty for the Senate and the Congress to not recognize that we, too, have a duty to shape the foreign policy of the United States and the power to declare war in the budgets that we pass, in the laws and conditions that we put in place, and in our ability to override vetoes, when necessary, even in the process of nominating individuals to serve in the U.Government and the executive branch.  We not only have the power, we have the obligation; the obligation to shape and mold and direct the foreign policy of this Nation, and if we don't, then we are not living up to the oath we took when we entered this body, and that it is not a political thing. This is not about embarrassing anyone. This is not about partisan issues. It should never be. In fact, one of the traditions that has existed in this Nation for a long time is that foreign policy, when it came to issues that impacted the security issues of the United States, there was an effort to make sure it was as bipartisan or nonpartisan as possible because when America gets in trouble on national security, there is no way to isolate on a bipartisan basis.  It is my hope, as we debate all these other issues, that we continue to keep these issues in mind because it is critical to the future of our Nation, critical to our standing in the world, and ultimately vital and critical to the kind of world and Nation we will leave to our children and grandchildren in the years and decades to come.  I, for one, in the midst of all of this debate about a bunch of issues that divide us, will continue to work to ensure that this is one that unites us and allows us to live up to our constitutional obligation, to participate fully in shaping and directing the foreign policy of this great  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

12243,topic-id,1401,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and having a long and pleasant conversation, after hearing his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, and after carefully reviewing his record, I have concluded that I cannot support a man with his views for a lifetime seat on the Supreme  The Supreme Court is the most important judicial body in this country. The decisions that it reaches, even on a 5-to-4 vote, have a profound impact on all Americans, on our environment, and on our way of life. As we decide this week as to how we are going to cast our votes regarding Judge Gorsuch, it is important to understand how that vote for Judge Gorsuch--for or against him--will impact the lives of the people of our country.  Let me give you just a few examples as to what is at stake. Seven years ago, in a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Citizens United, and in that case, by a 5-to-4 decision, the Court said that billionaires and corporations could spend as much money as they wanted on the political process. This decision, as all Americans know, opened the floodgates of corporate money, of money from the billionaire class, such that the wealthiest people in our country today can now elect candidates who represent their interests and not the interests of ordinary  That decision, Citizens United, is undermining American democracy, and in my view, it is moving us toward an oligarchic form of society in which a handful of the wealthiest people in this country--the Koch brothers and others--now have the power not only to control our economy but our political life as well. In my view, Citizens United must be overturned, and we must move back to a nation where our political system is based on one person, one vote, not on the ability of billionaires to buy elections.  Based on my conversation with Judge Gorsuch and a review of his record, do I believe that he will vote to overturn Citizens United? Absolutely not. Further, I suspect that he will vote to undermine our democracy even further by supporting the elimination of all restrictions on campaign finance, something which the Republican leadership in this body wants.  What the Republican leadership is striving toward is eliminating all campaign finance restrictions, such that billionaires can say to somebody: I am going to give you $500 million to run for the U.Senate from California, and you work for me--no independent expenditures. I will select your campaign manager, your speech writer, your media adviser, your pollster. You are my employee.  That is what the Republican leadership here wants. They want to undermine all campaign finance laws, and I believe that Judge Gorsuch will move this country in that way, a more and more undemocratic way.  Further, when we talk about the political process, it is important to point out that in 2013, again by a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court gutted the 1965 historic Voting Rights Act, a law which was passed to combat racial discrimination in voting in a number of What the Court said, finally, is that in the United States, you have the right to vote no matter what the color of your skin is, a historic step forward in making this country the kind of country that it must become.  Well, as a result of that 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision in 2013 gutting the Voting Rights Act, literally days after, we had Republican Governors and Republican legislatures all over this country, under the guise of fighting voter fraud, passing laws--everybody knows this--intentionally designed to make it harder for people of color, for poor people, for young people, for older people to vote in elections.  In America in the year 2017, it is not too much to ask that all of our people who are eligible to vote be able to vote without harassment, without roadblocks, without barriers being placed in front of them.  I know it is a radical idea, but it is called democracy. It is called democracy. It says that if you are eligible to vote, we want you to vote. We want you to participate. It says that in America, where we have one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on Earth, we want more people to be participating in the political process, not fewer people. There is nothing I have seen in Judge Gorsuch's record or in his recent statements to suggest to me that he is prepared to overturn this disastrous decision on the Voting Rights  In 1973, we all know, the Supreme Court decided Rowe v. Wade and declared that women have a constitutional right to control their own bodies. That decision has been subsequently affirmed by multiple cases as recently as last  In his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch refused to state if he believed Roe v. Wade was good law and should be upheld. Based on his statements and general philosophy, I believe there is a strong likelihood that Judge Gorsuch would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and deny the women of this country the constitutional right to control their own bodies. This would be an outrage. I do not want to be a party to allowing that to happen.  In addition, under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has time and again voted in support of corporate interests and against the needs of the working people of our country. After reviewing Judge Gorsuch's record, I believe he will continue that trend.  In a case called TransAm Trucking, Judge Gorsuch argued that a trucker was properly fired by his employer for abandoning his cargo at the side of the road after his truck broke down and he nearly froze to death waiting for help. Judge Gorsuch literally believed that this man should have had to choose between his life and his job, and by choosing his life--not freezing to death--he deserved to lose his job.  In another case, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a university was correct to fire a professor battling cancer rather than grant her request to extend her sick leave. I find these decisions troubling.  At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when so many working people throughout this country feel powerless at the hands of the wealthy and the powerful and their employers, we need a Supreme Court Justice who will protect workers' rights and not just worry about corporate profits. I fear very much that Judge Gorsuch is not that person.  I listened carefully to what my friend, Senator Cornyn of Texas, had to say about this entire process. I have to say that in his remarks there was a whole lot of obfuscation because there is a simple reality that we are going to have to deal with in the Senate this week. Everybody knows, and Senator Cornyn made the point, that under Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader, the rules, in fact, were changed. They were changed because of an unprecedented level of Republican obstructionism, making it impossible for President Obama to get almost any of his nominees appointed.[[Page S2187]]  Let's not forget that in the midst of that controversial decision--and it was a controversial decision--the Democratic leader had the power also to say that we will waive the 60-vote rule regarding Supreme Court nominees. Democrats had the power, and they chose not to exercise that power in ending that rule--although, of course, they could have done that. I think the reason was that the Democratic leadership appropriately and correctly believed that on an issue of such magnitude, the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, it is important that there be bipartisan support. But right now, it appears that the Republican leadership is going to do what the Democratic leadership did not do; that is, waive that rule and get their judge appointed with 51 votes.  So I would suggest to the Republican leader that instead of trying to push this nominee through with 50-some-odd votes, it might make more sense that, rather than changing the rule, change the nominee, and bring forth someone who, in fact, can get 60 votes.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

So clearly we need a vigorous discussion regarding the qualifications of President Trump's nominee, Jeff Sessions, to be Attorney We need to hear all points of view. The idea that a letter and a statement made by Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., a letter that she wrote, could not be presented and spoken about on the floor of the Senate is, to me, incomprehensible.  It comes at a time when we have a President who has initiated, and I hope it will not stand, a ban on Muslims entering the United States of We have a President who refers to a judge who issues a ruling in opposition to the President as a so-called judge, which tells every judge in America that they will be insulted and marginalized by this President if they dare to disagree with him.

12348,topic-id,684,"Mr.President, I think many millions of Americans perceive, as I do, that these are not normal times.  We have had a new President of the United States who called a judge a ``so-called judge'' because he dared to disagree with President Trump's decision on the ban of Muslims coming into this country.  We have a President who attacks the media in this country as fake news; everything they are saying is a lie. We have a President who goes before the troops--men and women in the American military--and starts talking about politics. It is very clear to me that we have a new President who really does not understand the Constitution of the United States of America, who does not understand the separation of powers in the Constitution, and in that context, we need an Attorney General who will have the courage to tell the President of the United States when he is acting in a dangerous, authoritarian, or unconstitutional way.  I have known Jeff Sessions for a number of years, and personally, I like Jeff But I do not believe at this moment in history, when we need people around this President to explain the Constitution to him, that Jeff Sessions will be the Attorney General to do that.  I am deeply concerned about voter suppression in this country. I am deeply concerned that, as a result of the Supreme Court's gutting of the Voting Rights Act, we have, in State after State after State, Governors and legislatures that are working overtime to make it harder for poor people, people of color, older people, young people to participate in the political process.  Today in the United States, we have, compared to the rest of the world, a low voter turnout. Only about 60 percent of eligible voters in America cast a ballot. Our job--whether you are conservative, Republican, Progressive, Independent, Democrat--whatever you are, if you believe in democracy, what you should believe in is bringing more people into the political process, increasing our voter turnout, not working as hard as you can to suppress the vote.  I want an Attorney General of the United States of America to tell those Governors, to tell those attorneys general all over this country that as Attorney General of the United States, he will fight them tooth and nail in every way legally possible to stop the suppression of the vote in State after State throughout this country.  We have the dubious distinction in this country of having more people in jail than any other nation on We have about 2.2 million We are spending about $80 billion a year locking them up, and the people who are disproportionately in jail are African American, Latino, Native  I want an Attorney General who understands that the current criminal justice system is failing, that we have to figure out ways to keep people from getting into jail by investing in education, in jobs, and that incarceration and more jails are not the answers to the crisis we face within criminal justice. I honestly do not believe that Jeff Sessions is that person.  In recent years, we have made significant progress in allowing people--regardless of their sexual orientation--to get married and to have the full rights of American citizenship. I do not believe that Jeff Sessions will be the Attorney General who will be supportive of LGBT rights.  We have some 11 million undocumented people in this country. I believe that most Americans see the solution as comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.  Today we have some 700,000 people who are DACA recipients, who have come out of the shadows and trusted the Federal Government to protect them. We need an Attorney General who is sensitive to the needs of DACA recipients, who will pursue humane immigration policies, and advocate for the need of comprehensive immigration reform.

12198,topic-id,872,"Mr.Speaker, I am really grateful to the gentleman for yielding but also for organizing this Special Order on something that really is special: Who is going to sit on the Supreme Court, and how do we deal with Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination? Of course, we in the House don't have a vote, but we certainly do have the privilege to be able to weigh in on something as important as this in this manner. So I do appreciate the opportunity.  Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court is the latest battle in the Republicans' war on women and workers. I will find myself agreeing and probably repeating some of what Congresswoman Jayapal has said, but I think it bears repeating.  First of all, let me say we should make no mistake: this is a stolen Supreme Court seat. Senate Republicans demonstrated unprecedented--meaning never before in history--disrespect for the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and our Constitution by denying Judge Merrick Garland a vote or even a hearing when he was put into nomination by President That has never, ever happened before in our history.  Last year, Republicans ignored their constitutional duty by denying Judge Garland a hearing. By the way, he had been approved by the Congress in the past for a seat on the district court, and he had praise on both sides of the aisle. So it wasn't a question of his being qualified or not. It was they did not want the ability of Barack Obama to even nominate someone and have him considered for the Supreme  So now they want to break the rules of the Senate to rush their own nominee through. This is a nomination to the United States Supreme Court, the highest body in the land, the highest Court in the land. The decisions the next Justice takes part in will affect Americans for decades, if not centuries, because it could set precedent. Given the importance of this position, Senators have the right to insist on a 60-vote threshold for ending the debate on the nominee, and Senate Democrats should insist on 60 votes because Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated time and time again that he has put the interest of corporations above Americans--I will describe that later--whether it is worker safety or a woman's access even to contraception.  I am going to talk for a minute about women. President Trump said he would nominate a judge to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that said, as a matter of privacy, that women could make their own decisions about terminating a pregnancy. Women take that threat very seriously. Judge Gorsuch talked about precedents he likes, like Brown v. Board of Education, integrating the schools. I agree with him on that. But tellingly, when he mentioned the precedents that he reveres, he certainly did not give Roe v. Wade the same status.  Judge Gorsuch's judicial record should add to our concern. After the 10th Circuit panel ruled against the State of Utah's attempt to defund Planned Parenthood following the release of deceptively edited videos, Judge Gorsuch called for the full court to hear the case, presumably to overturn the decision. Judge Gorsuch was in the minority in this instance, and his request was dismissed.  In the Hobby Lobby case, Judge Gorsuch sided against women, allowing bosses to deny their women employees contraception as part of health coverage.  Now I want to talk a little bit about workers. In many other cases, Judge Gorsuch has prioritized the interest of employers over the rights of workers. He blocked a woman in Colorado from going to trial on sexual harassment claims because she didn't report the harassment quickly enough.  Judge Gorsuch denied a professor with leukemia at Kansas State University protection under the Rehabilitation He sided with a mining company after a worker was electrocuted due to inadequate safety training. He sided with a trucking company that fired a trucker driving through Illinois--that is my State--who decided to leave his broken trailer instead of freezing to death, literally. The truck was down, couldn't get started, and his choice was to sit there with the truck or to be able to go to safety in freezing temperatures.  Fortunately for workers, Judge Gorsuch was in the minority in some of those cases, but we can't count on him being in the minority once he is on the Supreme His dangerous antiwoman, antiworker views should not be elevated to our highest court.  So I urge my Democratic colleagues in the Senate to stand strong against the Gorsuch nomination. And to Senate Republicans, it was disrespectful to the Constitution to block Judge I am not even saying necessarily that he would have been approved, but to not even offer him a hearing or a vote was disrespectful to our Constitution, and it is disrespectful to the traditions of the Senate to force Judge Gorsuch through now.  We don't want to break the rules to get one nominee through, especially not a nominee who puts critical protections for Americans at risk. Women are watching. Workers are watching. And on Friday, all Americans will know whose side the Senate is on and whose side the Senate Republicans are on. Everyone is paying attention.

12267,topic-id,3799,"Mr.President, I am an institutionalist. I believe in this place. I love this place. People don't always like the rules or how they are interpreted, how they are administered, but the rules have historically differentiated the Senate from any other legislative body in the world, and I believe in that.  But what Senator Warren did earlier tonight was not over the line. And here we are worrying about decorum and rule XIX, which says that ``No Senator in debate shall . . . impute to another Senator . . . any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.''  And let's be really clear here. This would not be a problem if Senator Sessions were not a  In other words, anytime a Senator is nominated for a Cabinet position, you can be as positive as you want, but if you want to be as tough on a Senator who has been nominated as we have been on Rex Tillerson or Betsy DeVos, you run the risk of breaking the rules.  Now let's pause a moment to understand how divorced from reality this is. While debating Jeff Sessions as the next Attorney General, Elizabeth Warren crossed an invisible line, and a rule almost never used was invoked.  The rule was not invoked when somebody called another Member a cancer. The rule was not invoked when somebody called another Member a liar.  Now, this is ridiculous, but it is actually not the main point. Here is the[[Page S881]]point. Lots of people--almost everybody in the world--everybody in this country does not have the luxury of worrying about decorum. What a luxury we have to debate if a stray comment crossed some theoretical line.  This place, this place of privilege, this place, the dome next door built by slaves, this place, where there were hardly any women or people of color or gay people out of the closet until very recently, yet we spent hours worrying about whether Elizabeth hurt Jeff's feelings or broke a sense of decorum. What a luxury it is to worry about that.  In the meantime, Muslim families in America are terrified. In the meantime, DACA kids are worrying about whether they have to go into hiding. In the meantime, LGBT youth are bullied in school. In the meantime, anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise across the country.  And we are here worrying about whether it is impolite to quote in full the statement of the widow of Martin Luther King,  Look, I am for this body. I am old-school. I like the rules.

We rotate through. There are at least 30 of us doing about 30 hours of debate, but there are only seven of you, and your wrists are sore, your legs are sore. This is incredibly challenging. Yet without you, we have no Senate  So thank you for your service and your contributions to the world's greatest deliberative body.  In his final speech as Attorney General, Eric Holder gave us a warning and one that remains relevant in the Senate today. He said:       Beware those who would take us back to a past that has      really never existed or that was imbued with a forgotten      inequity. Our destiny as Americans is always ahead of us.  Today our country faces a stark choice. Do we want to pursue an imaginary past or do we want to continue to follow the path toward progress? Do we continue in our struggle to form a more perfect union, to secure the blessings of liberty? It is hard to believe, but these are the dramatic choices before us as we consider the Cabinet nominations of this administration. And that choice is perhaps most clear in the nomination of our colleague Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney  The Attorney General is the highest law enforcement official in the country. He or she is the defender of American values, of human rights, and of civil rights, and this person needs to have an unbreakable commitment to fight for what is right and to lead that pursuit in making America more free and more just. That is the kind of approach we need because that is what the job demands.  The Attorney General leads the 1 watchdog for civil rights in our country. It is the Department charged with protecting voting rights and prosecuting human trafficking and hate crimes. They determine and defend the constitutionality of U.policies. Our next AG will face critical challenges that will test our justice system and our values. We need a leader committed to protecting the rights of every American regardless of race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation.  While I do like him as a colleague, Senator Sessions is the wrong person to serve as our Nation's Attorney In my judgment, his policies, priorities, and overall philosophy fall short of the standard our country has for the leader of the Justice Throughout Senator Sessions' career, he has been on the wrong side of history. If you look at the key issues that this Attorney General will work on, it is clear that Senator Sessions' views fall outside the mainstream of  That is certainly true when it comes to criminal justice. Look at Senator Sessions' opposition to the Sentencing Reform and Corrections This bill was a big deal. It would have reduced mandatory minimum sentencing for low-level, nonviolent crimes, while keeping tougher penalties for serious or violent crimes; it would strengthen drug addiction, rehabilitation and mental health treatments, and improve our efforts to help people who were leaving prison to settle into their communities and get back on track. Everybody liked it. Senator Grassley introduced it with cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. The bill had support from the House Speaker, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major Counties Sheriffs' Association, the National District Attorneys Association, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, among many others. Even the Koch brothers liked this piece of legislation. That is because it tackled problems we all agreed needed to be solved.  No one wants to see excessively punitive sentences that expand the Federal prison population, which has grown by 734 percent between the year 1980 and 2015. No one wants to see unnecessary barriers that make it harder for formerly incarcerated people to stay out of jail. No one wants to see taxpayer money spent needlessly.  So we had a thoughtful, bipartisan bill, but we were not able to enact it into law. Senator Sessions personally blocked the bill from being considered after it passed the Judiciary Committee last And he said: ``Federal drug and sentencing laws have already been considerably relaxed.''  The failure of reform impacts the lives of people who are hurt by unfair and outdated sentencing rules. It especially affects the families and communities of color who have been ravaged by the overincarceration of minorities. The ACLU reports that sentences imposed on Black men in the Federal system are almost 20 percent longer than sentences imposed on White men with similar crimes. Think about that--the same crime, and you get 20 percent more time if you are African And while people of color are just as likely as White people to sell or use illegal drugs, they are more likely to be arrested. Think about how preposterous that is--equal for justice for all, equal application of the laws, right?  People of color and Caucasians use drugs and distribute drugs in the same percentages, yet they are more likely to be arrested. African Americans make up 14 percent of regular drug users but 37 percent of people arrested for drug offenses. This raises the question of bias in law enforcement. Senator Sessions opposes holding State and local law enforcement accountable for racial bias and policing or the excessive use of force. He has called the approach the Justice Department took to this accountability an end run of the democratic process. He has attacked bipartisan efforts to reduce the sentences of nonviolent, low-level drug offenders, and he opposed President Obama's initiative to address racial disparities in our criminal justice system and restore fairness by granting clemency. Senator Sessions was critical of a Justice Department initiative that reduced overcrowding in Federal prisons by 20 percent over just the last 3 years.  Senator Sessions' views on drug policy are maybe even more out of the mainstream. He has been one of the most outspoken advocates against the legalization of marijuana, both recreational and medicinal. In an April 2016 hearing, he suggested that the Federal Government must send the message that ``good people don't smoke marijuana.''  This is 2016. This isn't 1975. This is 2016. Our Attorney General nominee says ``good people don't smoke marijuana.'' Tell that to the cancer victim. Tell that to my good friend John Radcliffe, who has stage 4 liver and colon cancer.  But Senator Sessions supports aggressive Federal intervention in States that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana. He criticized the Federal Government's guidance on Federal marijuana regulation, which directed the Justice Department to respect the decisions of States to determine their own criminal laws. Because of this guidance, Federal prosecutors stopped targeting patients who rely on medical marijuana products for relief. They stopped targeting local dispensaries that are operating squarely within State law. Instead they went after criminal drug traffickers and violent drug crimes. That seems like a[[Page S882]]smart prioritization of resources within the Justice Department--not going after people who want to utilize marijuana to alleviate pain but rather going after violent drug crimes. That seems smart, but Senator Sessions opposed that.  The respect for federalism reflected in the Justice Department's guidance should be right in line with conservative values. Under the guidance, as long as States are preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors, if they are preventing the growing of marijuana on Federal lands, and if they are stopping State-authorized marijuana activities being used as fronts for other illegal activities, then the Justice Department doesn't interfere.  I would like to quote from Senator Sessions' argument against this policy. He said:       I think one of Obama's great failures that is obvious to me      is his lax treatment and comments on marijuana. . . . It      reverses 20 years almost of hostilities in drugs that began      really when Nancy Reagan started ``Just Say No.''  But here's the thing. There is a bipartisan consensus now that the drug war is a failure. The drug war did not work. The drug war did not decrease the percentage of people utilizing illegal drugs. Every time the government succeeded in shutting down a drug trafficking ring, another would pop up. And a harsh penalty didn't slow addiction rates, it just incarcerated mostly young men. They didn't slow the flow of drugs; instead, they crowded our prisons, hurt taxpayers, and increased drug-related violence in other countries.  Now is the time to shift our strategy and focus on people who struggle with addiction. We also need to respect the decision in many cities and States to decriminalize drug possession. It is up to them as to how to ascribe relief to citizens who could benefit from using medical marijuana.  There is another area where I believe Senator Sessions is out of the mainstream, and that is his views on LGBTQ equality. Senator Sessions opposed the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a bill that I was proud to support that would have ended workplace discrimination for LGBTQ people. Right now there are no Federal laws that explicitly protect LGBTQ individuals from discrimination. That is not because we haven't tried. Last Congress, I cosponsored a bill to prohibit this kind of discrimination, but even without a law on the books, the Justice Department has interpreted the Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity. That could change, however, under the next Attorney  As head of the Justice Department, Senator Sessions could choose to interpret the law differently, and his record gives us every reason to be concerned. Senator Sessions also voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women He voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act because of a provision that ensures that victims of domestic violence are not turned away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. That is why he voted against VAWA, because there is a provision that says you have to provide services to individuals regardless of their sexual identity. He advocated for stripping that provision and ultimately voted against the bill. As Attorney General, he could choose not to enforce this nondiscrimination clause.  Think about this. If a gay person is a victim of sexual assault, are they not morally and legally entitled to the same humanity, the same protection under the law? Senator Sessions has repeatedly opposed hate crimes protections against LGBTQ Americans, even attempting to insert a poison pill amendment to stop the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act from moving forward. He has argued against Federal prosecution of hate crimes, saying on the Senate floor that there is no need for the Justice Department to get involved. As Attorney General, Mr.Sessions would be in charge of enforcing the Hate Crimes Prevention It is not a stretch to ask whether or not his enforcement would be vigorous. In fact, Senator Sessions has repeatedly supported laws that criminalize the LGBTQ community. In the 1990s, he tried to block an LGBTQ student conference--a student conference for gay kids that ``promoted a lifestyle prohibited by sodomy and sexual misconduct laws.'' He argued against a conference for kids to give each other support and come up with strategies to survive bullying, to understand that what they are going through other kids are going through, arguing that it promoted a lifestyle prohibited by sodomy and sexual misconduct laws. And he sharply criticized the legal decision that put a rightful end to the criminalization of same-sex relationships.  He supported don't ask, don't tell, saying that it was pretty effective. And he opposed the repeal of that law.  On marriage equality, Senator Sessions has vowed to work again and again to amend the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. We went through this in 1998 in the State of How unusual it is to enshrine in the Constitution the removal of a right.  I want you to just think about that--that you want to amend the Constitution, not to provide additional rights, not to clarify something, but to explicitly prohibit Americans from having a certain right.  I don't think there are many families who would agree on Senator Sessions' views here. People don't want their sons and daughters to have to hide their sexuality in order to serve their country. They don't want to go back to the days when our Nation failed to recognize the legitimacy of same-sex relationships. And they certainly don't want to see their friends and family lose a job or even go to jail because of whom they love, but that is the record that we are dealing with.  To be clear, these aren't views from the 1970s. These are his views as of last year. These are his current views on these matters.  The Senator has a similarly out-of-step approach on immigration. Mr.Sessions was instrumental in defeating the 2007 immigration reform bill, referring to it as ``terrorist assistance.'' He was a strong opponent of a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill, even though the bill had the strongest border security provision ever seen in an immigration bill. It was such a strong security border provision that I hated it. I had to think about whether I was going to vote for this thing because I felt it was too much of a militarization of our southern border. I thought it was a giveaway and a waste of money. But it had a strong border security provision, and it was voted out of the Senate by a wide margin.  If it were up to him, we would also limit legal immigrants coming to our country. During the markup in the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions offered an amendment to limit legal immigration, which failed 17 to 1. If you are wondering whether it is rhetorical to say his views on immigration are out of the mainstream, the record shows 17 to 1--17 to 1.  In addition, he promotes cutting Federal funding for sanctuary cities. Sanctuary cities is a brand. People aren't sure what that means. Let's be clear what we mean by that. Stripping funding from sanctuary cities is wrong because cities have decided that the strength of their relationship between their police and their citizens is more important for public safety than doing the Federal Government's job of enforcing immigration laws.  Senator Sessions, of course, is against the right of children born in the United States to be American citizens. He is against helping the many DREAMers in this country.  Let's have an honest discussion about immigration. We need to start talking about why people come to this country. Some of them come because they want to escape their own awful circumstances and live in freedom and opportunity. It is my grandparents escaping the It is my wife's grandparents leaving It is the Schatz; it is the Binders; it is the It is Albert Einstein; it is Madeleine This is who we are. We are people from all over the world who are united not by our ethnic extraction or our religious affiliation, but tied together by our love for America and our belief in this country as the beacon of hope, the shining city on the hill. The idea that we would shred that legacy in the face of some imaginary public desire for immigration reductions, frankly, is disturbing.  Look at the protests happening every weekend at our country's international[[Page S883]]airports. Americans are not out in the streets demanding that we shut off the lamp outside the golden door. They are demanding that we stay true to our history and to our roots.  That is why we saw close to 100 companies file a legal brief earlier this week against the Muslim ban put in place by the President and implemented by a man who has been mentored by Senator The brief they filed notes an important statistic about our country. More than 200 companies currently listed on the Fortune 500 list are founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants, and this stands in direct contrast to the nominee's views. If immigrants are coming to the United States and starting businesses and hiring people, they aren't taking jobs from They are creating jobs for Americans, and that has been the story of our country since the very beginning.  Immigration is one of the cornerstones of our country, and the nominee's policy proposals would chip away at that.  The world is watching. History is watching. We have to ask ourselves: What do they see? Do they see Lady Liberty? Or do they see something else, something darker?  Our country is asking similarly ominous questions about the basic, most fundamental right in our society, and that is the right to vote. Our country's history books are filled with stories of the struggle for voting rights, of African-American men risking it all to go to the polls and women in white marching through the streets of Washington, DC, demanding to vote. But that struggle and that progress is in danger with the kinds of policies that are being promoted. It is on all of us to honor that history and make sure that whoever is eligible to vote is able to vote. This is the bedrock of all other rights, because it is what gives us the voice when incumbent leaders and our representatives fail to protect the other rights.  In his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr.Sessions said:       The Department of Justice must never falter in its      obligation to protect the civil rights of every American,      particularly those who are most vulnerable. A special      priority for me in this regard would be aggressive      enforcement of our laws to ensure access to the ballot for      every eligible American voter, without hindrance or      discrimination, and to ensure the integrity of the electoral      process.  But his record does not support that view. Senator Sessions supports voter ID laws that will disenfranchise many, many voters. He has called the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive,'' and he has praised the Supreme Court ruling that dismantled a key part of the Voting Rights He has already had his nomination rejected by the Senate because of his views on this issue.  This should concern anyone and everyone who cares about our democracy because, at the most basic level, democracy is built on the ability of American citizens to go to the polls.  Let's be honest. Our right to vote is being restricted. It is being restricted even though the United States has some of the lowest voter turnout of any developed democracy on the planet, and it is being restricted based on a lie. There is no voter fraud. Voter fraud is not the problem. Voter disenfranchisement is the problem.  I talked with a buddy of mine back home who was watching FOX News and he was watching MSNBC, and he said: Democrats are saying there is voter disenfranchisement and Republicans are saying there is voter fraud, and I don't know what to believe. Well, here are the facts. There is a vanishingly small amount of voter fraud. You are more likely to be struck by lightning than to be convicted of voter fraud. This is a made-up problem. Why would you make up a problem such as this? Because it gives you a context and a pretext to do the systematic dismantling of voting rights. This is happening in North Carolina, this is happening in Wisconsin, and this is happening all over the country.  The final policy area I would like to raise is women's rights. The nominee's record is very clear on these issues. He opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which lifts the legal restrictions for people who may have faced pay discrimination. That, in itself, is extraordinary, because Lilly Ledbetter is from Senator Sessions' home She worked in a factory in Alabama for years, and then one day someone slipped her an anonymous note--what a story. Someone slipped her an anonymous note that said: You are paid way less than everyone else in this same job.

But the Senate, led by a Member of the President's own party, didn't stand by and watch the void, unmoved. They filled the vacuum for the good of the country.  It is this kind of history that has shaped the Senate into what it is today, a body that examines, considers, and protects.  Senator Byrd, the longest serving Senator in U.history once said: ``The Senate is a source of wisdom and judgment--both on the actions of the lower house and on the executive.''  That is what the Senate is for. That is our purpose. We achieve that purpose through customs and traditions; through members who serve 6-year terms and represent whole States; through rules that force bipartisanship, deliberation, and compromise.  Now the majority leader has placed one of those rules on the chopping block because they can't get to 60. He can't find the 60 votes needed to end debate on the President's nomination to the Supreme  We shouldn't be surprised to find ourselves here because, after all, back in February, President Trump told the majority leader to change the rules if he had to. Now, as this administration closes in on its first 100 days without passing a single piece of major legislation, the Senate majority leader is ready to fulfill the President's request and change the rule, instead of changing the nominee.  The question I have for this body is this: Should we change the rules in order to give the President a win before spring break? Should we be weakening the Senate at a time when the executive branch is so weak? Isn't it our obligation to assert ourselves into this void, instead of receding from responsibility?  I can think of no instance in the history of any great legislative body in which a legislature decides to diminish its own power. This is beyond strange in the world's greatest deliberative body, in the world's most powerful legislative For what good reason would we give up our own prerogatives?  This administration has been ineffective. Now the Senate majority leader is suggesting that the Senate respond to this executive weakness by weakening ourselves. This is wrong. The purpose of the Senate is achieved through bipartisanship, deliberation, and compromise. The 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees preserves these ideals. Changing this rule will make it harder to get there.  Look at the House of Look at the way the House Intelligence Committee has dissolved so quickly into partisanship, unable to do its job.  Look at the country. Look at the campaign last year. We are a country divided. Polarization is at an all-time high. Now is not the time to crush a cornerstone of the Senate's foundation.  I don't think this is inevitable. This is not unstoppable. This is up to all of us. It is up to the Members of the Senate to decide if we are going to damage the world's greatest deliberative body at a time when the country needs us the most.  The Senate has always been defined by its The rules, the customs, and the traditions--they help. But at the end of the day, it is the Members of the Senate--like Calhoun, Webster, Clay, Kennedy, Inouye, Hatch, McCain--who make the Senate relevant and necessary.  We are going to find out who we are, as I would ask that at a minimum, the Senate take its time on this decision. Don't rush. That is not who we are. That is not how we get to the best decisions. This is about the future of the Senate and the future of the The nuclear option will mean nominees for the Supreme Court won't have to even meet with the minority party to be confirmed. It will mean that the Senate's habit of being slow--sometimes maddeningly slow--will go away. That tradition that allows the center to hold--not just in this Chamber but across the country--will be undermined.  So to my Republican colleagues, please take a few weeks before you decide to change the Senate forever. Take your time here. This is probably one of the most serious decisions that you are ever going to make as a Senator because it is about the Senate itself. This is worth talking about. This is worth deliberating over. It is worth thinking over.  Go home and talk to your constituents. If you want to do this, you have the votes. You can do this three Mondays from now, anytime you want. But for goodness sake, there is no harm in thinking about it. All we need are three members of the Republican Party to go to the majority leader--either publicly or privately--and say: Give us some time to find another way to do this. Otherwise, you will make the Supreme Court, this place, and this country more extreme and more divided. You will answer this difficult moment in history by weakening one of the last bastions of bipartisanship, and I believe you will regret it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

12237,topic-id,2168,"Mr.President, first, I sat at the back of the room to listen to my colleague from I know he got up because he wanted very much to respond to the majority leader, and I thought he did a great job. It was a pleasure to listen, as always, to one of the most articulate Members with whom I have ever served in any legislative body, as well as his having many other good traits.                             Equal Pay Day  Mr.President, today is Equal Pay Unlike many holidays on our calendar, Equal Pay Day is not actually a commemoration of some achievement. Equal pay for women is still not close to a reality. Women still make 79 cents for every dollar a man makes in the same position. African-American women are making 64 cents on the dollar. Latina women are making 54 cents on the dollar. That is not right. It is holding the American dream out of reach for too many women in this country. So Equal Pay Day is not a commemoration; it is a reminder that glass ceilings are everywhere and that there are hugely consequential and tangible barriers that women face every single day that men do not.  In 2007, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision by the conservative majority in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, ruled that Lilly Ledbetter could not pursue her claim that she was entitled to equal pay. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which reversed this unfair Supreme Court decision, was the first bill President Obama signed into law in 2009.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, this leads me to the Supreme It is just one of so many examples of what is at stake in the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which we now debate here on the floor of the  I was listening to the majority leader earlier this morning, and I cannot believe he can stand here on the floor of the U.Senate and with a straight face say that Democrats are launching the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. What the majority leader did to Merrick Garland by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster. For him to accuse Democrats of the first partisan filibuster on the Supreme Court belies the facts, belies the history, belies the basic truth.  My friend Representative Adam Schiff said: ``When McConnell deprived President Obama of a vote on Garland, it was a nuclear option. The rest is fallout.'' Let me repeat that. Adam Schiff put it better than I ever could. ``When McConnell deprived President Obama of a vote on Garland, it was a nuclear option. The rest is fallout.''  Even though my friend the majority leader keeps insisting that there is no principled reason to vote against Judge Gorsuch, we Democrats disagree. First, he has instinctively favored corporate interests over average Second, he has not shown a scintilla of independence from President Third, as my colleague from Illinois elaborated, he was handpicked by hard-right special interest groups, not because he called balls and strikes. They would not put all of that effort and money into a caller of balls and strikes. These are ideologues who want to move America far to the right. He was picked by hard-right special interest groups because his views are outside the mainstream.  According to analyses of his record on the Tenth Circuit, which were conducted by the New York Times and the Washington Post, by experts on the Court, Judge Gorsuch would be one of the most conservative voices ever on the Supreme Court should he achieve that.  The Washington Post:       Gorsuch's actual voting behavior suggests he is to the      right of both Alito and Thomas and by a substantial margin.      That would make him the most conservative Justice on the      Court in recent memory.  That is why the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society put Judge Gorsuch on their list for President  As Emily Bazelon of the New York Times put it in a brilliant article that I would urge all of my colleagues to read:       The reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial      philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the      structure of modern government--including the rules that keep      our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect      workers and consumers.  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 1, 2017]                  The Government Gorsuch Wants To Undo                   (By Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner)       At recent Senate hearings to fill the Supreme Court's open      seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch came across as a thoroughly bland      and nonthreatening nominee. The idea was to give as little      ammunition as possible to opponents when his nomination comes      up this week for a vote, one that Senate Democrats may try to      upend with a filibuster.       But the reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial      philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the      structure of modern government--including the rules that keep      our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect      workers and consumers. In strongly opposing the      administrative state, Judge Gorsuch is in the company of      incendiary figures like the White House adviser Steve Bannon,      who has called for its ``deconstruction.'' The Republican-     dominated House, too, has passed a bill designed to severely      curtail the power of federal agencies.       Businesses have always complained that government      regulations increase their costs, and no doubt some      regulations are ill-conceived. But a small group of      conservative intellectuals have gone much further to argue      that the rules that safeguard our welfare and the orderly      functioning of the market have been fashioned in a way that's      not constitutionally legitimate. This once-fringe cause of      the right asserts, as Judge Gorsuch put it in a speech last      year, that the administrative state ``poses a grave threat to      our values of personal liberty.''       The 80 years of law that are at stake began with the New      President Franklin Roosevelt believed that the Great      Depression was caused in part by ruinous competition among      companies. In 1933, Congress passed the National Industrial      Recovery Act, which[[Page S2182]]     allowed the president to approve ``fair competition''      standards for different trades and industries. The next year,      Roosevelt approved a code for the poultry industry, which,      among other things, set a minimum wage and maximum hours for      workers, and hygiene requirements for slaughterhouses. Such      basic workplace protections and constraints on the free      market are now taken for granted.       But in 1935, after a New York City slaughterhouse operator      was convicted of violating the poultry code, the Supreme      Court called into question the whole approach of the New      Deal, by holding that the N.I.R.was an ``unconstitutional      delegation by Congress of a legislative power.'' Only      Congress can create rules like the poultry code, the justices      said. Because Congress did not define ``fair competition,''      leaving the rule-making to the president, the N.I.R.     violated the Constitution's separation of powers.       The court's ruling in Schechter Poultry v. the United      States, along with another case decided the same year, are      the only instances in which the Supreme Court has ever struck      down a federal statute based on this rationale, known as the      ``nondelegation doctrine.'' Schechter Poultry's stand against      executive-branch rule-making proved to be a legal dead end,      and for good reason. As the court has recognized over and      over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome body      that moves slowly in the best of times, while the economy is      an incredibly dynamic system. For the sake of business as      well as labor, the updating of regulations can't wait for      Congress to give highly specific and detailed directions.       The New Deal filled the gap by giving policy-making      authority to agencies, including the Securities and Exchange      Commission, which protects investors, and the National Labor      Relations Board, which oversees collective bargaining between      unions and employers. Later came other agencies, including      the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety      and Health Administration (which regulates workplace safety)      and the Department of Homeland Still other agencies      regulate the broadcast spectrum, keep the national parks      open, help farmers and assist Americans who are overseas.      Administrative agencies coordinated the response to 11,      kept the Ebola outbreak in check and were instrumental to      ending the last financial crisis. They regulate the safety of      food, drugs, airplanes and nuclear power plants. The      administrative state isn't optional in our complex society.      It's indispensable.       But if the regulatory power of this arm of government is      necessary, it also poses a risk that federal agencies, with      their large bureaucracies and potential ties to lobbyists,      could abuse their power. Congress sought to address that      concern in 1946, by passing the Administrative Procedure Act,      which ensured a role for the judiciary in overseeing rule-     making by agencies.       The system worked well enough for decades, but questions      arose when Ronald Reagan came to power promising to      deregulate. His E.P.sought to weaken a rule, issue by the      Carter administration, which called for regulating      ``stationary sources'' of air pollution--a broad wording that      is open to interpretation. When President Reagan's E.P.     narrowed the definition of what counted as a ``stationary      source'' to allow plants to emit more pollutants, an      environmental group challenged the agency. The Supreme Court      held in 1984 in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council      that the E.P.(and any agency) could determine the meaning      of ambiguous term in the law. The rule came to be known as      Chevron deference: When Congress uses ambiguous language in a      statute, courts must defer to an agency's reasonable      interpretation of what the words mean.       Chevron was not viewed as a left-leaning decision. The      Supreme Court decided in favor of the Reagan administration,      after all, voting 6 to 0 (three justices did not take part),      and spanning the ideological spectrum. After the conservative      icon Justice Antonin Scalia reached the Supreme Court, he      declared himself a Chevron fan. ``In the long run Chevron      will endure,'' Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989 article,      ``because it more accurately reflects the reality of      government, and thus more adequately serves its needs.''       That was then. But the Reagan administration's effort to      cut back on regulation ran out of steam. It turned out that      the public often likes regulation--because it keeps the air      and water clean, the workplace safe and the financial system      in working order. Deregulation of the financial system led to      the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and the financial      crisis a decade ago, costing taxpayers billions.       Businesses, however, have continued to complain that the      federal government regulates too much. In the past 20 years,      conservative legal scholars have bolstered the red-tape      critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only      Congress--not agencies--can create rules. This is Schechter      Poultry all over again.       And Judge Gorsuch has forcefully joined in. Last year, in a      concurring opinion in an immigration case called Gutierrez-     Brizuela v. Lynch, he attacked Chevron deference, writing      that the rule ``certainly seems to have added prodigious new      powers to an already titanic administrative state.''      Remarkably, Judge Gorsuch argued that Chevron--one of the      most frequently cited cases in the legal canon--is      illegitimate in part because it is out of step with (you      guessed it) Schechter Never mind that the Supreme      Court hasn't since relied on its 1935 attempt to scuttle the      New Nonetheless, Judge Gorsuch wrote that in light of      Schechter Poultry, ``you might ask how is it that Chevron--a      rule that invests agencies with pretty unfettered power to      regulate a lot more than chicken--can evade the chopping      block.''       At his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch hinted that he      might vote to overturn Chevron without saying so directly,      noting that the administrative state existed long before      Chevron was decided in 1984. The implication is that little      would change if courts stopped deferring to the E.P.A.'s or      the Department of Labor's reading of a statute. Judges would      interpret the law. Who could object to that?       But here's the thing: Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that      Congress can use broadly written laws to delegate authority      to agencies in the first place. That can mean only that at      least portions of such statutes--the source of so many      regulations that safeguard Americans' welfare--must be sent      back to Congress, to redo or not.       On the current Supreme Court, only Justice Clarence Thomas      seeks to strip power from the administrative state by      undercutting Chevron and even reviving the obsolete and      discredited nondelegation doctrine, as he explains in      opinions approvingly cited by Judge But President      Trump may well appoint additional justices, and the other      conservatives on the court have expressed some uneasiness      with Chevron, though as yet they are not on board for      overturning it. What would happen if agencies could not make      rules for the financial industry and for consumer,      environmental and workplace protection? Decades of experience      in the United States and around the world teach that the      administrative state is a necessary part of the modern market      economy. With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, we will be      one step closer to testing that premise.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2180-3.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,4.0,April
12238,topic-id,1697,"There are clearly principled reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch, and enough of us Democrats have reasons to prevent his nomination from moving forward on Thursday's cloture vote.  The question is no longer whether Judge Gorsuch will get enough votes on the cloture motion; now the question is, Will the majority leader and our friends on the other side break the rules of the Senate to approve Judge Gorsuch on a majority vote? That question should be the focus of the debate here on the floor, and it should weigh heavily on the conscience of every  Ultimately, my Republican friends face a simple choice: They can fundamentally alter the rules and traditions of this great body or they can sit down with us Democrats and the President to come up with a mainstream nominee who can earn bipartisan support and pass the  No one is making our Republican colleagues change the rules. No one is forcing Senator McConnell to change the rules. He is doing it of his own volition, just as he prevented Merrick Garland from getting a vote of his own volition. Senator McConnell and my Republican colleagues are completely free actors in making a choice--a very bad one, in our opinion.  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are uncomfortable with this choice, so they are scrambling for arguments to justify breaking the rules. Let me go through a few of these justifications and explain why each does not hold up.  First, many of my Republican colleagues will argue that they can break the rules because ``Democrats started it in 2013'' when we lowered the bar for lower court nominees and Cabinet appointments.  Let's talk about that. The reason Majority Leader Reid changed the rules was that Republicans had ramped up the use of the filibuster--the very filibuster they now decry--to historic proportions. They filibustered 79 nominees in the first 5 years of Obama's Let's put that into perspective. Prior to President Obama, there were 68 filibusters on nominations under all of the other Presidents combined, from George Washington to George We had 79. Our colleagues and Leader McConnell, the filibuster is wrong? There were 79--more than all of the other Presidents put together. The shoe was on a different foot.  They deliberately kept open three seats on the second most important court in the land--the DC Court of Appeals--because it had such influence over decisions made by the government. This is the court, other than the U.Supreme Court, that the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation hate the most. The deal that a[[Page S2183]]number of Senators made in 2005 allowed several of the most conservative judges to be confirmed to that court--very conservative people. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I am sure in my colleagues' and in many others.  But then, when President Obama came in, they insisted on not filling any additional seats on the court--which, of course, would have been Democratic seats--and eventually held open 3 of the 11 seats on that court. They said they would not allow those seats to be filled by President Obama--an eerie precedent, which the majority leader repeated with Merrick He didn't want the DC Circuit to have Obama-appointed, Democratic-appointed nominees; he didn't want that on the Supreme Court, so he blocked Merrick He didn't want it on the DC Circuit, so they wouldn't let any of President Obama's nominees come to the floor.  Merrick Garland's nomination was not the first time the majority leader held open a judicial seat because it wasn't the President of his party, and that was not during an election year.  At the time, I spoke with my good friend from Tennessee, Senator I asked him to go to Senator McConnell and tell him that the pressure on our side to change these rules--after all of these unprecedented numbers of filibusters--was going to be large. I said to Senator Alexander: Let's try to avoid it. But Senator McConnell and Republicans refused all of our overtures to break the deadlock they imposed.  To be clear, Democrats changed the rules after 1,776 days of obstruction on President Obama's nominees. My Republican friends are contemplating changing the rules after barely more than 70 days of President Trump's administration. We moved to change the rules after 79 cloture motions had to be filed. They are talking about changing the rules after 1 nominee fails to meet the 60-vote threshold.  So, yes, Democrats changed the rules in 2013, but only to surmount an unprecedented slowdown that was crippling the Federal judiciary, and we left the 60-vote threshold intact for the Supreme Court deliberately. We could have changed it. We had free will then, just as Senator McConnell has it now. But we left the 60-vote threshold intact for the Supreme Court because we knew and know--just as our Republican friends know--that the highest Court in the land is different.  Unlike with lower courts, Justices on the Supreme Court don't simply apply precedents of a higher court; they set the precedents. They have the ultimate authority under our constitutional government to interpret the law. Justices on the Supreme Court should be mainstream enough to garner substantial bipartisan support; hence, why we didn't change the rules; hence, why we believe in the 60-vote threshold; and hence, why 55 or 60 percent of all Americans agree with the 60-vote threshold, according to the most recent polls. To me, and I think to most of my friends on the Republican side, that is not a good enough reason to escalate the argument and break the rules for the Supreme  Second, as I have mentioned, I have heard my Republican friends complain that Democrats are conducting the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in history, so that is the reason they can justify breaking the rules because Democrats are the ones taking it to a new level. Again, I have just two words for my Republican friends: Merrick The Republican majority conducted the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court pick when their members refused to have hearings for Merrick  In fact, what the Republicans did was worse than a filibuster. The fact is, the Republicans blocked Merrick Garland using the most unprecedented of maneuvers. Now we are likely to block Judge Gorsuch because we are insisting on a bar of 60 votes.  We think a 60-vote bar is far more in keeping with tradition than what the Republicans did to Merrick We don't think the two are equivalent. Nonetheless, in the history of the Scalia vacancy, both sides have lost. We didn't get Merrick Garland; they are not getting 60 votes on Judge  So we are back to square one right now, and the Republicans have total freedom of choice in this situation.  Finally, Republicans have started to argue that because Democrats will not confirm Judge Gorsuch, we will not confirm anyone nominated by President Trump, so they have to break the rules right now. That is an easy one. I am the Democratic leader. I can tell you myself that there are mainstream Republican nominees who could earn adequate Democratic support.  And just look at recent history. Justices Roberts and Alito, two conservative judges who many of us on the Democratic side probably don't agree with, both earned over 60 votes. They got Democratic votes. While there was a cloture vote on Justice Alito, he was able to earn enough bipartisan support that cloture was invoked with over 70 votes. He got only 58 when we voted for him, but the key vote was the cloture vote.  Let's have the President consult Members of both parties--he didn't with Gorsuch--and try to come up with a consensus nominee who could meet a 60-vote threshold. That is what President Clinton did with my friend, the Senator from Utah, in selecting Justices Ginsberg and It is what President Obama did with Merrick  Of course, we realize a nominee selected this way would not agree with many of our views. That is true. But President Trump was elected President, and he is entitled by the Constitution to nominate. But Judge Gorsuch is so far out of the mainstream that the Washington Post said his voting record would place him to the right of Justice He was selected by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society without an iota of input from the  There is a better way to do this. I know it sometimes may seem like a foreign concept in our hyperpolarized politics these days, but there is always the option of actually consulting Democrats on a nominee and discussing a way forward that both parties can live with. We are willing to meet anywhere, anytime.  So my friends on the other side can dredge up these old wounds and shopworn talking points if they choose. If Republicans want to conduct a partisan, ``they started it'' exercise, I am sure we could trace this all the way back to the Hamilton-Burr duel. But at the end of the day, they have to confront a simple choice: Are they willing to break the rules of the Senate or can they work with us on a way forward? I, for one, hope we can find a way to compromise. Judge Gorsuch was not a compromise. He was solely chosen without any consultation. So it is not that there is a Merrick equivalency.  My friend the majority leader said: ``I think we can stipulate that in the Senate it takes 60 votes on controversial matters.'' If anything is a controversial, important matter, it is a selection for the Supreme Court, and Senator McConnell has repeatedly stood for the rightness of 60 votes on important and controversial issues.  If Senator McConnell wants to change his view on the 60 votes all of a sudden and Republicans decide to go along with him, it will not be because Democrats started it, because that is not true. It will not be because Democrats will not confirm any President Trump-nominated Justice, because that is not true. It will be because they choose to do so, and they will have to bear the unfortunate consequences.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

They are worried their costs will go up. They are worried their benefits will go down. One of the concerns that came up, an issue that is on the minds of many Americans, was the high cost of drug prices.  During the campaign, the President talked the talk on drug prices. As President-elect, he said in December he would ``bring down drug prices.'' In January, he said pharmaceutical companies were ``getting away with murder.'' He repeated the refrain in his joint address to Congress last week. ``We should,'' he said, ``work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.''  Well, the immediate is here. TrumpCare, the repeal and replacement of the ACA, has been introduced. TrumpCare does absolutely nothing to address the high cost of drugs. In fact, drug prices might start going up faster. Once again, the President is talking the talk, talking like a populist, but not walking the walk, not helping average He is helping the wealthy, special interests but not the average folks he was talking to during the campaign.  The President met with a couple of Congressmen yesterday and talked about drug prices. Why not put something in TrumpCare? Why not let them negotiate, bring down costs? Instead, TrumpCare does the opposite. TrumpCare eliminates a current requirement that insurers actually give patients the value of the health insurance they are paying for. Under the ACA, insurers had to pay at least 60 percent of the cost of care provided--for some plans, more. That requirement would be gone. So that, again, hurts average folks.  That provision in TrumpCare is a blank check to insurers to cover less and charge more out-of-pocket for a whole host of services. Most experts agree that insurers could charge much more for its prescription drugs or even rationed care.  TrumpCare takes the shackles off the insurance companies and lets them decide how or if they are going to cover your prescription drug costs. Letting the insurance companies decide what to charge and cover has never been, and never will be, a recipe to bring down prices. So on drugs as well as other issues, TrumpCare: higher costs, less care.  What is particularly galling, of course, is the fact that the President talks about reducing the cost of drug prices and negotiating but does nothing.  He said he would do it immediately. The immediate is here. TrumpCare is here. TrumpCare makes it very likely that the cost of drugs could go up for average It is just another example of this President doing one thing but saying another. He promises the Moon and the stars, but his policies make them even further out of reach.  He says: ``I'll bring drug prices down.'' His bill does the opposite, and it is just another way in which this is a healthcare handout for the insurance companies and the wealthy but a raw deal for average  TrumpCare is really just a tax break for the rich. It is not really a healthcare program. Its 1 motivation is to reduce taxes on the top 0.01 percent. If you make above $250,000, your prices are going to come down. If you are in that 0.01 percent, your average reduction in taxes is $200,000--more than most Americans make. So this bill is not going to help average Americans; it is going to hurt them, unless you are in the top 0.01 percent.  As more and more people read the bill, the louder the chorus of opposition grows. The AARP, a very cautious organization--usually they don't like to take political stands--a few weeks ago, they had ads on TV praising President Trump for saying he will not cut Social Security or They came out strongly against the bill yesterday. Why? Because it would hurt seniors. They believe seniors--many average seniors whose income is $15,000--could pay up to $8,400 more. The people who might be hurt the most with this bill are average Americans between 50 years old and 65 whose costs inevitably will go up, whose healthcare will not be as good.  The AMA, another cautious organization, not known to be a big Democratic organization, came out against the bill. Doctors know how bad this will be for their patients and for  The Club for Growth, on the other side, has also opposed the bill. Hospitals, doctors, senior citizen groups have all come out against the bill. The hard right comes out against the bill, as do more moderate and liberal groups. That is because this bill is one big mess, done quickly in the dark of night. It is no wonder Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell don't want a lot of debate. They are embarrassed. This bill is an embarrassment to those who put it in because it doesn't do what it is supposed to do. That has led even Republican Governors such as John Kasich of Ohio and Brian Sandoval of Nevada to express concern over the destruction of the Medicaid As we know, it is shifting the costs to the  Governor Kasich said that TrumpCare ``puts at risk our ability to treat the drug addicted, the mentally[[Page S1709]]ill, and the working poor.'' It is almost certain that under this bill, treatment for opioids will be less available because Medicaid is going to be cut and Medicaid helps pay for it. It is almost certain that if you are a young person, a young family--say you are 30 or 40 years old, but you have mom or dad in a nursing home; Medicaid has been paying for most of that, and it is going to be cut. What are you going to do? Maybe they will have to move in with you. That is not so easy in a growing family with kids. Maybe you will have to pay a lot of money out of your pocket. So this bill hurts Americans up and down the line.  The ideological fervor of ``TrumpCare must cut back the role of government, whether it hurts people or not'' is motivating this bill. That in the abstract would be fine, but it hurts It hurts middle-class Americans who are young, it hurts middle-class Americans who are middle-aged, and it hurts maybe most of all middle-class Americans who are 50 to 65 years old. As people learn about this bill over the next few weeks, there will be rebellion in the land of  So I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle to listen to the voices of the average Americans whom I met today, who care about bringing down the unreasonable cost of drugs. They should listen to the voices of experts who say just about the only winners in this bill are the very wealthy, and they should listen to the voices coming from their own party who say this bill will hurt their States and hurt the country.  TrumpCare is a mess. If this Congress, if this House, if this Senate is smart, they will defeat TrumpCare, keep the ACA, and then we can work together on making it better--plain and simple.                       China and Trump Trademarks  Mr.President, on another matter, I am concerned about a recent report that the Trump business interests have been granted approval on a number of trademarks in  The President spent most of his campaign talking tough on He said China was ``ripping us off . . . and killing our companies.'' He promised to label them a currency manipulator, a cause near and dear to my heart, on day one. The President promised many times over, saying: We are going to label China a currency manipulator. There is nothing stopping him from doing it. He could have done it with a stroke of a pen.  My views on trade, particularly with respect to China, might be closer to the views President Trump expressed in his campaign than those of either President Obama or President But since the election, President Trump has been remarkably soft on  As the Acting President pro tempore knows, I was the original person--Senator Graham and I--who came up with the idea that China was manipulating its currency. We discovered it. I did, when I went to Crucible Steel near Syracuse and they told me how their business was being hurt by China manipulating its currency. At first, when Lindsey and I talked about it, people said: Oh, no, it is not happening. I was sort of proud of the fact that in those days both the New York Times, liberal, and the Wall Street Journal, conservative--their editorial pages both stated that China doesn't manipulate its currency; Schumer is off base. Now, of course, everyone knows they do. President Trump in his campaign said over and over again he was going to label them a currency manipulator which would have consequences to them on day one, the first day he took office. Now he has backed off his threats. He has been in office more than a month. He has not labeled China a currency manipulator.  Amazingly enough, in his first week he said he was no longer going to honor the One China policy. He was sending a shot over the bow to Beijing, that they can't keep getting away with what they have been getting away with in trade, in geodiplomacy, in cyber security, stealing our intellectual property, and everything else. When he did that, I was pretty pleased. Now he has backed off.  On the two issues where the President could have been really tough with China, currency manipulation and backing off on One China, he reversed himself within the last few weeks. Now, all of a sudden, we learn that China has granted preliminary approval to 38 new trademarks, allowing the Trump brand to market several different business ventures there, including hotels and golf clubs. Before he assumed public office, Donald Trump had been working to get trademarks from China for a decade without success. These particular trademark applications, filed during the campaign, just sailed through earlier this week.  It raises troubling specific questions: Did the Chinese Government and the Communist Party, who likely had a hand in granting these approvals, see some type of benefit from doing so now that Donald Trump is President? Did the President and his network of businesses personally gain from his office, and will that incline the President to make policy decisions that benefit China and hurt American workers?  We don't know if there is a link between the two. We don't know what was in the minds of the Chinese Government or the Communist Party when they all of a sudden granted these 38 licenses. It surely raises troubling questions.  It raises a bigger question. The wisdom of our Founding Fathers proves true day in and day out. Over 220 years after they wrote the Constitution, their wisdom is coming through now with President Trump because they wrote in the Constitution that anything of value--any emolument--to U.officials from foreign governments should be prohibited. U.officials should not be allowed to accept anything of value from any foreign government. In those days, one of the greatest worries of the Founding Fathers was that they wanted to prevent foreign governments from trying to curry favor with the United States by offering potential financial gain to our officials. This issue has been largely forgotten for a century or so, but the wisdom of the Founding Fathers is shining through now because President Trump, unlike just about any other President I can remember in recent history, has failed to completely separate himself from huge financial interests.  Now the questions arise. Is there a relationship? Are foreign governments seeking to curry favor? Is it affecting Donald Trump's decisionmaking? No one knows the answers to these questions, but the fact that the questions can be asked is extremely troubling.  The President has flouted all tradition and precedent, and I worry if the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution has been broken when President Trump retains a financial interest in his business empire. It leads to troubling questions like the ones raised by these trademarks.  As my colleague from Connecticut, who is an expert on this issue, a brilliant lawyer, Senator Blumenthal, said yesterday: I think the circumstances surrounding the approval of these trademarks ought to be looked into by this Congress for a potential emoluments clause violation. He is right, and I am glad he is going forward.  Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that time consumed during a quorum call be charged equally to both sides.

12341,topic-id,3020,"Mr.President, before I get into my speech regarding Senator Sessions, I wanted to talk a little bit about what occurred last night.  First, there is no doubt in my mind that the letter written by Coretta Scott King should be read by each and every Member of this Regardless of whether you disagree with her conclusions, her standing in the history of our Nation means her voice should be heard. What I took issue with last night and the true violation of rule XIX in my eyes were the remarks shared last night originally stated by Senator Kennedy--not Coretta Scott King--Senator  Whether you like it or not, this body has rules, and we all should govern ourselves according to the rules.  There is no doubt that last night emotions were very high, and I am not necessarily happy with where that has left us today. The Senate needs to function. We need to have a comity in this body if we are to work for the American people. This should not be about Republicans and It is not about us; it is about the American people.  If we remember that point as we move forward, our Nation will be able to heal where we hurt. We will be able to disagree without being disagreeable. This should be the norm, not a unique experience in public discourse.  Before I decided to give this speech, I had the privilege last night around midnight of having to sit in the Chair and presiding. My good friend Cory Booker was making an eloquent presentation about where we are on issues of race in this He was talking about the South, and he was talking about the pain, the suffering, and the misery.  Today, as I want to share my thoughts on Jeff Sessions and how I have come to my conclusion, I thought it was important for me to not try to persuade people but to simply inform, because this issue is not simply the issue about our next Attorney This is really an issue about all of us--not all of us as Senators but all of us as members of the American family. This is an issue that digs deep into the core of our souls, deep into the core of our Nation, deep into who we can be, who we should be, and how we will get there.  So my objective here, as I speak, will not be to somehow persuade the other side that your decision is wrong. I don't think that is my responsibility nor my intention. My goal isn't even to persuade those who believe that Jeff Sessions will not be a good U.Attorney General that they are wrong. I simply want to share information. I want to share facts. I want to share, as Paul Harvey used to say, ``the rest of the story,'' because if you read the news reports, you walk away with a clear picture based on facts but not necessarily a clear picture based on truth. There has been a distortion in many arenas, in many echo chambers about who he is and why I support him.  My good friend Cory Booker last night spoke about a true American hero, John John Lewis is an American hero. I know that this may or may not be popular with everyone in the Chamber or everyone in America on the conservative side or the liberal side, but the reality of it is this. He was beaten within an inch of his life so that I would have the privilege--not to stand in the Chamber but--to vote, to simply vote.  We should all thank God for the sacrifices of men and women so that people like myself, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris would be allowed one day not to simply vote but to serve in the most unique, powerful, and one of the most important legislative bodies in the world today. It is the sacrifices of men and women of color who fought against injustices. We stand as a nation on the shoulders of these giants. I know that I don't have to remind my mother or my family, but just as a reminder to those who are listening to the conversation, when I leave the Senate one day, I am still going to be Black, an African American--Black every day, Black every way, and there is no doubt.  This is an important part of the conversation because, as I read through some of the comments of my friends on the left, you will wonder if I ever had an experience as a Black person in I want to get to that in just a few minutes.  God, in His infinite wisdom, made me Black, born in Charleston, SC, for a purpose. I am blessed to be who I am, and I am equally blessed to be a Our country, the South, and, specifically, my State have suffered through difficult and challenging times around the issue of race. My grandfather, who passed away at 94 years old last January, knew a very different I remember listening to him talking about his experiences of having to step off of the sidewalk when White folks were coming. He learned early in life: Never look a White person in the eyes. He was in his forties in the 1960s. His whole life view, his paradigm, was painted with a broad brush. Separation, segregation, humiliation, and challenges.  It was in my home city of Charleston where the Civil War began. It was in my home city of Charleston where nearly 40 percent of all the slaves that came to America would come through in Charleston, It was a Charlestonian who came up with the concept written into our Constitution of three-fifths of a man--a  But it was also Charlestonians who, in 2010 had a choice between Strom Thurmond's son and a young--I use that word liberally--African-American guy named Tim  The evolution that has occurred in the South could be seen very clearly on this day in The very first shots of the Civil War were in They gave me the privilege of representing them in Congress, over the son of Strom Thurmond, over the son and the namesake of one of the most popular Governors in South Carolina, Carroll Campbell, I thank God that the South Carolina that I have come to know, the South that I have had the experience to enjoy is a different It is a different Charleston than my grandfather knew in his 94 years. But my life has not been one of privilege, of promise.  As I said just a few nights ago, I was born into a single parent household, living in poverty, nearly flunking out[[Page S950]]of high school. I have been called everything that you can think of from a racial perspective--good, not too often bad, very consistently. So I understand that there is room for progress. There is a need for us to crystallize what we are fighting about, who we are fighting for, and how we are going to get there.  This is an important day and an important issue, and the U.Attorney General is perhaps one of the most important decisions I will make about the Cabinet of President I will tell you that, for me, this has been a challenging journey, one that I have not taken lightly because, as I said earlier, I am going to be Black when I leave this body, and so when I think about some of the comments and some of the challenges for Jeff Sessions around the 1986 process, the trial of the KKK and the trial of the Turner family, an African-American couple--they were defendants he brought to court--I have heard it, and I wanted to know more about what it is we are talking about, not by reading it in the paper but by calling folks in Alabama, understanding with new eyes who Jeff Sessions is--not the guy I serve with but the guy who will have the most powerful position in law enforcement. I wanted to know firsthand who he was before he was nominated and how he would respond in a room filled with African-American leaders.  I and my best friend in Congress, Trey Gowdy, for a very long time throughout South Carolina have held meetings of African-American pastors and leaders coming together with law enforcement to try to bridge the gap that is obviously broken, bridge the gap that obviously exists between law enforcement and African-American leaders. So I brought Jeff Sessions down to see from a distance how he interacts with these African-American pastors, hear the tough questions on Walter Scott and other issues so I can have an appreciation and affinity of how the Justice Department under his leadership would act.  I take this responsibility seriously, and I wonder if my friends in the Chamber have had a chance to see what others think--not the political echo chamber, not the organization, but run-of-the-mill people.  So I had that experience, and I will tell you that without any question, the conclusion that I have drawn is a pretty clear conclusion. I am glad that I dug into the issue. I am glad I took the time to know Jeff Sessions the best I can from what I have read from 1986, what I saw in my own home city of Charleston, with a provocative history on race.  We are at a defining moment in our country, not because of the Attorney General, not because of the debate we are going through in this body, but because our country is being pulled apart from extremes on both ends. This is not healthy for our country. Too often, too many particularly on the right are found guilty until proven innocent on issues of race, issues of fairness. I say that because, as I think about some of the comments that have come into my office over the last several weeks, I am used to being attacked. If you sign up to be a Black conservative, the chances are very high you will be attacked. It comes with the territory, and I have had it for 20 years, two decades. But my friends and my staff are not used to the level of animus that comes in from the liberal left who suggest that I somehow am not helpful to the cause of liberal America and therefore I am not helpful to Black America because they see those as one and the same.  I brought some of the pages of chats that I have from folks, the comments I get from Twitter about my support of Jeff Sessions:  Tracy Johnson sent in ``Uncle Tim Scott.''  ``Everyone from SC who happens to be a left winger knows that Tim Scott is an Uncle [``S''] is documented.'' ``S'' is not for Scott; it is for fertilizer.  SGaut says: ``A White man in a black body: Tim Scott backs Jeff Sessions for attorney general.''  Until 3 weeks ago the only African-American chief of staff in the U.Senate out of 100 was the chief of staff for a The second African-American chief of staff in the U.Senate is the chief of staff of a Yet they say of my chief of staff that she is ``high yella,'' an implication that she is just not Black enough.  I go on to read from folks who wanted to share their opinions about my endorsing Jeff Sessions:  ``You are a disgrace to the Black race!''  Anthony R Burnam @BurnamR says: ``You an Uncle Tom Scott aren't you? How does a black man turn on his own.''  Anthony from @PoliticalAnt says: ``Tim Scott is not an Uncle He doesn't have a shred of honor. He's a House Negro, like the one in Jango.''  He also writes--I guess Anthony Burnam has been active on my Twitter feed--that I am ``a complete horror . . . a black man [who is] a racist.''  ``Against black people''  ``Big Uncle Tom [piece of fertilizer]. You are a disgrace to your race.''  I left out all the ones that use the ``N'' word. I just felt that would not be appropriate.  You see, what I am surprised by, just a smidgeon, is that the liberal left that speaks and desires for all of us to be tolerant does not want to be tolerant of anyone who disagrees with where they are coming from. So the definition of ``tolerance'' isn't that all Americans experience a high level of tolerance; it is all Americans who agree with them experience this so-called tolerance.  I am not saying this because it bothers me because, frankly, I have experienced two decades of this. You don't necessarily get used to it, but you don't find yourself as offended by it all. I just wish that my friends who call themselves liberals would want tolerance for all Americans, including conservative I just wish that my liberal friends who are self-described liberal would want to be innocent until proven guilty and not guilty until proven innocent.  So back to my findings on Jeff I brought Jeff Sessions to And you can read about it in the Post and Courier, the local newspaper. The pastor said that Jeff Sessions was warm and friendly, engaging and competent.  Now, I will say that the response from the NAACP and the NAN, the National Action Network, about the meeting that I had with the African-American pastors--that it was outrageous that I would invite African-American pastors to meet with this guy and they didn't have an invitation. So I invited two of their leaders. I didn't tell anyone who was coming because I wanted folks to come into the room and make their own decisions and come to their own conclusions. They decided not to come. Maybe it was because a conservative invited them. I don't know why. But I wanted everyone to have a chance, and they did. It was interesting.  Here are some other interesting facts that I have not seen often in the press, which I think is a very important point.  All of us who engage in conversations around this Nation about race and justice, to only have part of the story is just an unfortunate reality that we should get used to that I haven't gotten used to. But the reality is, 50 years ago, in 1966, Senator Sessions campaigned against George Wallace's wife for As a Senator, Jeff Sessions voted in favor of a 30-year extension of the Civil Rights He was one of only 17 Republicans to support the first Black Attorney General, Eric He spearheaded the effort to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, an Alabama native and civil rights icon.  As Cory Booker, my good friend from New Jersey, said last night as I presided, he and Jeff Sessions worked wonderfully well together in awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers of the civil rights movement in Selma,  Here is another part of the story that just hasn't seemed to break through the threshold of our national media on Jeff Sessions' support within the Black community. As I started making phone calls to leaders in Alabama who were Black and Democrats, I was very surprised at what I started hearing about Jeff I will start with an Alabama native, Condoleezza Rice, who is not a Democrat but who is an Alabama native. She said: Sessions has worked hard to heal the wounds in Alabama brought on by the ``prejudice and injustice against the descendants of slaves.''  Willie Huntley, an African-American assistant U.attorney under Jeff[[Page S951]]Sessions, now an attorney in Mobile, AL, has known Jeff Sessions for more than 30 years and said in an interview that he has never encountered racial insensitivity from Sessions in the three decades they have known each other.  Alabama Senate Democratic leader Quinton Ross said of Jeff Sessions: ``We have talked about things from civil rights to race relations, and I think anyone--once you gain a position like that, actually partnership has to go aside because you represent the United States and all the people. . . . I feel confident [Jeff Sessions] will be an attorney general that will look at it from all perspectives to just do what's right for the citizens of the United States.''  That is from an African-American Democratic leader in the Alabama State Senate, Quinton  From former Obama administration Surgeon General Regina Benjamin: ``I think he'll be fine. I consider him a friend. . . . At least he will listen as attorney general. My hope is that he'll do what is best for the American people.''  Former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson says this. Larry is 71 years old, so we are not talking about folks who grew up in my New South that I talked about earlier. Still we are working through it, but, boy, we have changed. This is a 71-year-old who says of Jeff Sessions: ``He doesn't have a racist bone in his body.'' He said: ``I have been an African American man for 71 years. I think I know a racist when I see one. Jeff is far from being a racist. He's a good person, a decent person.''  Gerald Reynolds, former chairman of the U.Commission on Civil Rights: ``During my discussions with Senator Sessions and his staff, it was clear that the senator has a strong interest in ensuring our nation's antidiscrimination laws are vigorously enforced. Senator Sessions is a man of great character and integrity, with a commitment to fairness and equal justice under the law.''  Just a few more.  Fred Fred Gray is an iconic figure in civil rights, for those of us who may not be familiar with him. Fred Gray is an African-American civil rights attorney. He represented the Reverend Martin Luther King, He represented Rosa He represented the Tuskegee men who were exploited in the syphilis experiment by the government.

It is absolutely appropriate today for us to take a look at what Russia and other countries may be doing to our news.  RT America, which broadcasts from studios here in Washington and is available on cable TV across the United States and across the world, for that matter, is one of the most high-profile assets in Vladimir Putin's vast $1.4 billion propaganda machine. According to the U.intelligence community, the Kremlin selects the staff for RT and closely supervises RT's coverage, including disinformation and false news stories designed to undermine our democracy.  Here we have a photo that shows exactly what I believe seems to be happening with This photo was taken from a declassified U.intelligence report, and it shows RT's editor-in-chief--and former Putin campaign staffer, by the way--Margarita Simonyan briefing Putin on RT's facilities. So clearly he is interested.  Well, I believe the American people have a right to know if a Russian Government entity is exploiting our first amendment freedoms to harm our country. It is galling that RT news has publicly--publicly--boasted that it can dodge our laws by claiming to be financed by a nonprofit organization and not the Russian  Well, what my bill--our bill--would do is strengthen the Foreign Agents Registration Act by giving the Department of Justice authority to compel foreign organizations to produce documentation to confirm funding sources and foreign connections. This is investigative authority that has been recommended by the Department of Justice inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and the Project on Government Our bill would create transparency by giving Justice the authority it needs to investigate RT America and publicly expose its ties to the  The audacity of Russia's interference in Western democracies, including extensive meddling in our 2016 Presidential election, is deeply alarming, and we have learned that Russia's influence campaign reaches tens of millions of unsuspecting False news stories can end up on our Facebook timelines and our Twitter feeds. They shape the political conversations that we have with our friends at the supermarket and our colleagues at work.  These are just a few of the headlines from This one is actually from Sputnik, which is another Russian news outlet. They show the extent to which these false news stories are being spread around. This one talks about how ``1,000s Turkish forces surround NATO's Incirlik air base for `inspection' amid rumors of coup attempt,'' which suggests that we were involved in that coup attempt.  ``FBI wiretapped Trump Tower in search of `Russian mobster.' ''  ``Spying on Trump: CIA Whistleblower Points Finger at Clapper, Brennan, Comey.''  ``Ukrainian Su-25 fighter detected in close approach to MH17 before crash.'' You will remember that this was the plane crash over Ukraine--that the Russians shot down.  During our Presidential campaign in 2016, dozens of narratives and false news stories originated in Russia--for instance, this one, the baseless story that the Obama administration launched a coup against the Turkish Government from the U.airbase in that country.  Earlier, RT News ran numerous reports on supposed U.election fraud and voting machine vulnerabilities, claiming that the results of the U.elections could not be trusted and did not reflect the people's will.  Well, researchers have traced these and other stories to a common source: the Kremlin's sophisticated, multifaceted propaganda empire, which reaches some 600 million people across 130 countries and in 30 languages.  If you watch RT News, you will agree that it is not clear whether you are watching a U.news station or a Russian station because it has slick production values. It is arguably the jewel in the crown of this propaganda empire.  According to the U.intelligence community report declassified in January:       The Kremlin has committed significant resources to      expanding the [RT News'] reach, particularly its social media      footprint. . . . RT America has positioned itself as a      domestic US channel and has deliberately sought to obscure      any legal ties to the Russian government.  A prime objective of this propaganda barrage is to influence U.and European public opinion, create confusion, and shape election outcomes.  The Associated Press has identified a building in Moscow where an estimated 400 internet trolls--fluent in English and well-versed in American politics--work 12-hour shifts, creating false narratives and fake news stories. These stories are then seeded on the internet, they get validated, and they get passed on by popular websites and eventually end up on our radios, TVs, and smartphone screens.  In an incident earlier this month, a discredited former CIA employee went on RT News to charge that President Obama had asked British intelligence to spy on Donald Well, this false news story was then spread by legal commentator Anthony Napolitano on the FOX News show ``Fox and Friends,'' which is regularly watched by the The claims were then cited by President Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to defend the President's claims that his predecessor had wiretapped Trump  Well, we know that during testimony before Congress 2 weeks ago, the NSA Director, ADM Michael Rogers, agreed with our British allies that the original RT News story was utterly ridiculous.  At an Armed Services Committee hearing last month, Philip Breedlove, Retired, the former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, told us that when Russian-backed forces shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014, the Russians put out four stories within two news cycles placing the blame on the Ukrainian Government and others. This is the headline that we see from The general said it took 2 years for[[Page S2188]]the West to finally debunk these false news stories.  We know that Russia interfered in our 2016 Presidential election. We know that a Russian influence campaign was one aspect of that interference. Our intelligence community has concluded that RT America is an arm of the Russian propaganda juggernaut, operating openly in our country and taking full advantage of our First Amendment freedoms.  I am sure we would all agree that everyone in the United States, in every organization, has a right to speak, write, and broadcast freely. That is what our First Amendment says. We are a resilient democracy. We are confident that our values and institutions will prevail in the free marketplace of ideas. Our Constitution protects the right of individuals and organizations to spread those Russian viewpoints, disinformation, and even outright lies, but the American people have a right to know if RT America is a Russian propaganda organ that takes its direction from the They have a right to know who is funding their operations.  RT has publicly boasted that it uses a shell nonprofit corporation to dodge U.laws. This legislation, the Foreign Agents Registration Modernization and Enforcement Act, would put an end to that charade. The legislation Senator Young and I recently introduced would give the Department of Justice the authority it needs to request documentation from RT News on funding sources and foreign connections.  As we see here, clearly the legislation has hit a nerve because Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov defended RT News, and Russia's State Duma is considering measures to retaliate.  What RT says about our legislation is that ``US senator wants to probe RT as a `foreign agent' . . . What's next, public executions''? Well, that is ridiculous. The editor-in-chief at RT News has said that my legislation is a ``persecution of dissenting voices.'' As I said, that is just nonsense. I welcome dissenting voices. That is what our First Amendment and the United States are all about. But it is not reasonable or acceptable for an individual or organization working in the United States on behalf of a hostile foreign government to conceal funding and direction that it receives from that government.  Vladimir Putin is not going to stop us from enforcing our laws and protecting our country. We have a responsibility to expose RT News, RT America, and the entire panoply of tactics that Russia has used to interfere in our 2016 election and that they continue to currently use to sow confusion and distrust and spread around stories which pretend to be news but which are not accurate.  Make no mistake, the Kremlin's influence campaign is an ongoing enterprise, and to the extent that it is successful, that it can operate under the radar screen, it will become even more brazen and more aggressive in the future.  In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last December, Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution said that Russia's broader objective is to subvert Western democracies, and we see that going on now in He said: ``For the United States to ignore this Russian tactic, and particularly now that it has been deployed against the United States, is to cede to Moscow a powerful tool of modern geopolitical warfare.'' That was a direct quote.  This is a profound test for our country. Our democracy has been attacked and continues to be under attack from this kind of news that is being put out by a Kremlin-funded organization which is a hostile foreign power. We need to understand the Kremlin's tactics, and we need to expose this propaganda here in the United States, including RT To that end, I urge my colleagues to support the Foreign Agents Registration Modernization and Enforcement Let's give the Department of Justice the tools it needs to investigate and expose RT  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

It has gone on a long time, and we have heard from a lot of proponents and opponents of Jeff Who would know Jeff Sessions better maybe than I would? I have worked with Jeff Sessions since he came to the Senate 20 years ago. Between us we have been here 50 years, 30 years for me, 20 years for him. Our staffs worked day and night on issues that have affected our State and affected the  I first really got to know Jeff Sessions when he was the Attorney General of He had been the U.attorney. He was pretty well known, but I didn't know him. We didn't really know each other until he became the Attorney  I urged him to run for the U.I thought he could win, but I thought not just that he could win but that he could bring something to this body. I thought he would be a good colleague, he would be a good Senator for the State of Alabama and for the United States of America, and he has been.  When you deal with people day after day--remember, we all know each other as colleagues here. There are just 100 of us. It sounds like a lot of people, but it is not. When we interact on committees, when we deal with each other, when our families are thrown together, we talk, we debate, we maybe even fight a little bit at times over issues. We get to really know somebody.  I know Jeff Sessions pretty well. I believe he is competent as a lawyer, he was a good lawyer, he was a good prosecutor, and he served our State as Attorney He has been active on the Judiciary Committee where he has chaired a subcommittee. He has been active on the Budget He has been active on the Armed Services He has been active right here in the Senate--our Senate--on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and he is well respected.  What kind of Attorney General do we want? We want somebody who is competent, somebody with integrity--integrity above everything. That is what counts in this job. This is a very, very important job. These are big shoes. Jeff Sessions can fill those shoes, and I am happy and proud to be here and to vote for him tonight. I wish my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would join us.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask to proceed on leader time.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.Mr.President, I would like to say a word about the nominee we are about to confirm. We have long known our colleague from Alabama as Senator Sessions--and soon Attorney General Sessions--but it wasn't always this way. There was a time when the distinguished Senator from Alabama was known simply as ``Buddy.'' Buddy--the product of a small town called Hybart, the son of a country store owner, the inheritor of modest beginnings.  Senator Sessions' parents grew up in the They taught their son the value of a dollar and the importance of hard work. If our colleague wasn't at school or football practice, you were likely to find him at his dad's store lending a hand to customers. As anyone from a small town can attest, that little store served as far more than just a place to buy goods. It was also a local gathering place, a place where people were liable to share their hopes and concerns, and their dreams too.  This is where Jeff Sessions developed his core values. It is where he developed an appreciation for the everyday struggles of working people. It is where he learned the importance of listening first, of standing up for what matters, of putting others' needs before one's own. It made him a better person. It made him a pretty good politician too.  Senator Sessions is the kind of guy who, with just one conversation, can make you feel as if you have known him your entire life. He is usually the first to arrive at constituent events and the last to leave. He has also made it a priority to travel annually to every county in Alabama--all 67 of them.  His staff will tell you it is these trips home when Senator Sessions is really in his element. Driving across Alabama, from sunup to sundown, milkshake in hand, or maybe a Blizzard from Dairy Queen, Heath bar flavor, thank you very much, that is Senator  Now, it is not hard to see why Alabamians keep sending him back to Last time out he scooped up a modest 97 percent of the vote.  Part of Senator Sessions' secret to success is simple enough; he is just a likable guy.  Our colleague is one of the most humble and most considerate people you will ever meet. He is a true Southern gentleman. He is pretty funny too. His staff would certainly agree. They still remember the time he accidentally ran his suit coat through the paper shredder. They saved the evidence too. Let's hope that one makes it into his archives.  Sessions' alums call this man a mentor. They remain ever grateful for his focus on their own development. I know they are going to miss grabbing a burger and fries with him at Johnny  They are really going to miss his wife Mary as well. We will around here too.  Now, in Sessions' world, Mary Sessions is something of a legend. She has been our colleague's strongest supporter, no matter the task before him. She has been a source of encouragement and a friend to all of Team I doubt they will ever forget Mary's friendship or her famous cream cheese pound cake.  One thing they will not soon forget either is Senator Sessions' intense focus on the office's letter-writing operation. Sometimes that meant working weekends with the boss to get the constituent correspondence just right.  There is no doubt Senator Sessions is very, very particular about his writing, whether it is constituent letters or legal memoranda, and there is a good reason for that. Words, as this lawyer is known to say, have meaning. It is a philosophy that has animated Senator Sessions' longtime love affair with the law.  He believes in equal application of the law to each of us, regardless of how we look or where we come from. It is a genuine passion for him. It is an area of deep importance and principle.  Senator Sessions will stand up for what he believes is right, even when it isn't always the easiest thing to do.  Now, this is a guy who fought for Republican principles long before--long before--Alabama became a red He stood up to the George Wallace dynasty as a young man. He stared down the forces of hate as U.attorney and State attorney general. He has continued to fight for the equal application of the law as well, not to mention a growing economy, a streamlined government, and a strong defense.  Of course, as anyone who knows him will tell you, Senator Sessions is a lawyer's lawyer. He is willing to hear the other side of an argument. He is willing to make the other side of the argument as well. He is also willing to be persuaded.  He has worked across the aisle with Democrats like the late Senator Ted Kennedy and the assistant Democratic leader on issues like prison reform and sentencing reform. Democrats have praised him as someone who is ``straightforward and fair'' and ``wonderful to work with.''  The politics of the moment may have changed, but the truth of statements like these endures. Deep down, each of us knows these things remain just as true about Senator Sessions today as they did when our Democratic colleagues praised him.  Fair in action, bound to the Constitution, a defender of civil rights, this is the man we have come to know in the It is the same man we can expect to see as Attorney  Senator Sessions may be leaving the Senate, but there is plenty this Eagle Scout will be taking with him. That includes the motto he has lived by--``Be Prepared''--which is so engrained in our friend that it is even engraved into the back of the granite nameplate on his desk. It is a simple phrase with a simple message, and it seems particularly fitting for our friend today.  He has a big job ahead of him. I think he is up to the task. He is tough, but he[[Page S963]]is fair. He is persistent, but he is respectful. He is a likeable guy, a principled colleague, and an honest partner. And while we are really going to miss him, we also couldn't be prouder of him.  So let us thank Senator Sessions for his many years of service.  The PRESIDING All time has expired.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Sessions nomination?  ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS873-2.txt,1049,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,6.0,February
12456,topic-id,1515,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to talk about an issue that will affect families all across Michigan, which is the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme He has a long record of siding with special interests and institutions instead of hard-working Americans, and this is of great concern to me. That matters.  I am concerned with his rulings that fail to protect children and students with disabilities in schools, and I am worried that he will limit access to critical healthcare for women and that he is not a mainstream candidate. I can't support a nominee whom I believe is disconnected from the challenges faced by families in Michigan and across America every day.  There is one important example which relates directly to someone from Michigan that Judge Gorsuch has ruled on. People from Michigan have been hurt by Judge Gorsuch's narrow judicial philosophy.  In 2009, a Michigan truckdriver named Alphonse Maddin was trying to complete a shipment driving all night, and his brakes froze in subzero temperatures--which we have. The heater in his cab broke as well. He called his company to report the issue and waited for help to arrive.  While he was waiting for hours in the freezing subzero temperatures, he realized he was having trouble breathing and his body was going numb. He called his company to report that he needed to get somewhere warm, but they told him he needed to either wait for the repair person, or drag his trailer even though the brakes were frozen. Worried he might freeze to death, he finally unhitched the trailer from his truck. Mr.Maddin drove off to seek help, returning in just 15 minutes with assistance. He did what any of us faced with a life-threatening situation would do.  A week later, Mr.Maddin was fired from his job, even though he was transparent in his actions and completed his delivery. He completed his delivery, despite the issues caused by his frozen brakes and the broken heater.  Two different entities within the Department of Labor ruled that what the trucking company did was illegal, and that Mr.Maddin was protected under Federal law because his life was in danger. Thankfully, a majority of the Tenth Circuit judges agreed. Judge Gorsuch, however, disagreed, arguing the law did not protect workers who drove away to avoid freezing to death.  According to Judge Gorsuch's interpretation, Mr.Maddin would have had to choose between his job and his life. What is deeply concerning to me is that when he was asked at his nomination hearing what he would have done, he said he really hadn't thought about it. Judges should think about what is happening to people in situations as they are ruling in a fair and impartial way. This does not look like the ruling of a mainstream nominee.  His rulings don't only affect Michigan workers. I am very concerned about Judge Gorsuch's rulings on legal protections for individuals with disabilities. We passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to make sure that children with disabilities got the education they deserved, and that the education would be free and available to all children.  Luke, a young boy from Colorado with autism, was not able to receive the education he needed from his public school. His parents were able to enroll him in a private residential program specializing in children with autism that was more suitable for his needs so he could get what he needed for his development.  His parents applied to the school district for reimbursement, as was appropriate, but the school district refused. His parents went to court, and an administrative judge and a district judge both ruled that the school did not provide Luke with the necessary education to meet the needs that IDEA required. However, Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of the school district, saying that all the school district had to do was provide an education that was more than just the bare minimum--just the bare minimum. He set a very low bar for Luke and for students like Luke, like my nephew  Just to show how disconnected Judge Gorsuch is from the lives of everyday Americans, look at the Supreme Court ruling which occurred at the same time as Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearings. In a different case on the very same issue, the Supreme Court challenged and rejected the standard and interpretation that Judge Gorsuch believed should be provided for children and students with disabilities. They unanimously rejected the standard that he approved. This is not the view of a mainstream nominee. This is not the view of a mainstream nominee.  I am also deeply concerned about Judge Gorsuch's opinions and how they could affect women's access to healthcare. In the Tenth Circuit's Hobby Lobby decision, Judge Gorsuch endorsed the idea that corporations can deny their employees access to essential healthcare services, including birth control. His concurring opinion suggested that he supported the notion that for-profit corporations have the right to deny women insurance coverage or any form of contraception an employer disagrees with. This is both alarming and unacceptable. It once again shows how disconnected Judge Gorsuch is from what women in Michigan and around the country experience.  Judge Gorsuch did not recognize the impact of denying coverage to women employees and their families, and putting those decisions in the hands of their employers. Women in Michigan should not have to pay higher costs for healthcare than men, and they should not be denied essential healthcare services. These dangerous interpretations will continue to take us down a path of permitting and protecting discrimination by corporations and institutions over the rights of workers and consumers. Again, that is not a mainstream nominee.  When it comes to supporting women--not just in healthcare, but in the workplace--Judge Gorsuch has had some extremely troubling rulings. In 2003, a woman named Betty Pinkerton experienced several instances of disgusting sexual harassment from a male supervisor at the Colorado Department of Every time she made it clear his comments were not acceptable in any way, they continued over the course of months.  She went to her office's civil rights staff and submitted a written complaint, and he was removed as her supervisor. She was fired about a week[[Page S2354]]later. She sued. But Judge Gorsuch upheld a ruling that claimed she waited too long--she waited too long to report harassment--and believed that Pinkerton's firing was performance based--How often do we hear that in these situations?--despite not being able to produce any real evidence that this was the case. He ruled that she couldn't go to trial and present her case in front of a jury.  So when it comes to protecting women in the workplace, we know that Judge Gorsuch has come up short. This is not a mainstream position and not acceptable, in my judgment, for any Supreme Court nominee, and not acceptable for what I want to see happen for the people in  I wish to end my speech on the importance of consensus because that is what we should do here. That is how we get things done.  For decades, we have confirmed our Supreme Court nominees with consultation and consensus. We have said--and I think it is the right thing--that we should have to have more than just a simple majority to confirm judges to the highest Court in the land for a lifetime appointment. So it makes sense that we come together to do that. In fact, seven of the eight current U.Supreme Courts Justices on the bench today received 60 votes or more somewhere in their process--both President Bush's and President Obama's nominees, as well, those now on the  President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama talked to Senators from both parties about their picks to get input as to whom would likely be supported and not supported. This did not happen with Judge President Trump had a list chosen by very narrow special interests and did not ask opinions of key people on our side of the aisle as to what would make sense to get the consensus to get 60 votes.  I do not believe Judge Gorsuch will be fair and impartial, giving a fair shot to the workers and families in Michigan as well as around the country. My test is very much about what is best for the people I represent in Who will be fair and impartial and give them a fair shot?  Because I do not believe he can do that, I cannot support his nomination. He is not the right choice for this vacancy. We can come together. I urge my colleagues to go back to the drawing board and bring in a consensus mainstream nominee.  In the past, we have basically had a practical rule of saying if the nominee cannot get 60 votes, we change the nominee. We don't change the rules. It is extremely concerning that this would not be the approach at this time.  I urge that we come together, get a mainstream nominee, and be able to work together to get this done.

12319,topic-id,1224,"Mr.President, I rise today to support the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General of the United He is a veteran and an outstanding public servant who has worked tirelessly for decades in service of his constituents in Alabama, in this body, as a U.attorney, as Attorney General of He is a good colleague and a friend to many of us on both sides of the aisle. He is gracious with his time, his wisdom, his intelligence.  In all nomination processes there is some twisting of facts that goes on and, unfortunately, even some character attacks, but the twisting of his record and the attacks on Senator Sessions, in my view, have been particularly egregious. That is why I was very saddened by what happened on the floor of the U.Senate last night.  One of our colleagues violated rule Here is what rule XIX says: ``No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.''  That is the rule. It has been in place for decades, and I don't think you need to be a Harvard law professor to realize that rule was violated last night.  Mr.President, like you, I have been in the Senate for a couple of years. I certainly have tried very hard to work with my colleagues, all my colleagues across the aisle, Democrats, I have respect for all of them. I have no problem whatsoever with Senators coming down, and in the last week or so, Senators coming down to the floor of the Senate to debate their views on nominees for Cabinet positions, up-or-down votes on the merits and the qualifications of these nominees. That is what we should be doing. That is our job. We have seen a lot of that over the last several weeks.  Like the Presiding Officer, in the last couple of years, I supported some of President Obama's Cabinet officials, was opposed to others, as is our job, on their merits and qualifications. We can do this in a respectful manner, especially here on the floor of the U.We can certainly do this in a way that does not violate rule XIX by imputing conduct and motives unbecoming of a U.More importantly, we can do this in a way that is respectful of each other. For the sake of the Senate and for the country, I hope we can get back to that tradition that is so important to this body.  Let me try to set the record straight on Senator Sessions, the Senator Jeff Sessions I know. I have gotten to know him over the last 2 years. He certainly has a long, distinguished history of public service. Nobody in this body is denying that. Everybody in this body knows Senator Sessions well, knows that he is a man of integrity, a man of principle. He will support the laws of the land, and he will be a fierce advocate for the rule of law and defending the  I wish to spend a few minutes on the broader issue of what is happening on the Senate floor right now. We are not getting a lot of press on it, but it is the unprecedented obstruction that is happening with regard to President Trump's Because of this obstruction--unfortunately, by my colleagues--more than 2 weeks into President Trump's term, he has fewer Cabinet Secretaries confirmed at this point than any other incoming President since George That is some pretty serious obstruction. Nineteen days into his term as President of the United States, President Obama had 21 Cabinet Members confirmed. Right now, President Trump has seven. President Obama had three times the numbers we now have today.  I believe most Americans--certainly the Americans I represent, fairminded Alaskans who are desperate to get our country and our economy working again--don't like this kind of obstruction. They see a new President who should be allowed to move forward with his Cabinet in place so the Federal Government can get to work on behalf of the American people. I think Americans are also seeing the reputation of good people who want to serve their country tarnished for political purposes.  I hope the Members on the other side of the aisle understand that the American people are wise. They see through all this theater. We need to get to work. We need to let the Trump administration get to work.  This body has a responsibility to treat the confirmation process with the same courtesy, seriousness, and focus the Senate gave to President Obama when he came into office, and that has not happened right now. It is not happening right now, and we need to move forward on that.                  Visit By The Prime Minister of Japan  Mr.President, we are on the eve right now of a very important visit of a very important ally. Prime Minister Abe of Japan will be visiting the United States here in the next day. He is going to be visiting with some Members of the Senate, visiting with President Trump and his team.  I wish to make a few points on how important this visit is, not only for the United States-Japan relationship, but the importance of our allies. We are an ally-rich nation. When you look around the world, you look at the broad number of allies the United States has, and then you look at our adversaries or potential adversaries who are ally-poor. This is one of the most important strategic advantages the United States has right now in the world, to keep Americans safe and our allies safe. We are an ally-rich nation and our adversaries and our potential adversaries are ally-poor.  For over 7 years, since the end of World War II, both the executive[[Page S929]]branch and this body and the House of Representatives have worked hard on this to build a system of allies all around the world to keep our country safe and our allies safe.  In his inaugural address, I was pleased to see that President Trump talked about reinforcing old alliances and forming new ones. That is exactly what we need to do as the United States of In terms of our allies and the importance of different regions, there is no more important ally than There are no more important foreign policy and national security challenges that exist in the world than what is happening in the Asia-Pacific with the rise of China and the security and economic challenges but also opportunities in that part of the world.  I urge all of my colleagues to warmly welcome the Prime Minister of Japan and his team and to help focus on making sure that as we move forward with a new administration, we are working together with them, we are encouraging them. As the Senate, we are very focused on this issue of deepening our existing allies and alliances and broadening the opportunities to create more.  The Senate plays a very important role in this regard. In terms of being able to keep American citizens safe, there is nothing more important than making sure we focus on our allies and, in particular, give a warm welcome to the Prime Minister of Japan this week.

All he has done for us has made Alaska a better place for literally thousands of people throughout our  Dan came to Alaska in 1974 after serving in the Army, as so many Alaskans do. Like so many Alaskans, he arrived with a glint of steel in his eye and a mission to help build our Alaska is full of natural wonders, but our manmade wonders are also marvels, and Dan wanted to be part of building more of those marvels for our State and for our country.  He first arrived in the North Slope Borough--the top of the world--to help the community build up their infrastructure and strengthen the Alaskan Native villages in the area. It was a time of enormous change for all of Alaska, particularly the North Oil from the North Slope Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in North America, had recently begun to flow down the Trans-Alaska System for 800 miles. The largest land claims act in U.history, the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act, had recently passed, and the governments in rural Alaska were being formed and reformed to take advantage of these opportunities.  After Dan went back to school to receive a master's degree in business administration from Gonzaga, he made his way back to Alaska again to serve as chief financial officer and chief administrative officer for Alaska's North Slope Borough, where he launched an ambitious and ultimately successful capital plan to provide basic necessities that so many Americans take for granted, like running water and sewer,[[Page S2359]]those kinds of services, to the villages throughout the North Slope Borough, again, on the top of the world.  According to Bill Tracey, Sr., from Point Lay, which is one of the villages there, who was a coworker at the time, ``Dan's excellent work ethic and skills earned him the respect of the North Slope leaders. . . . His accomplishments were remarkable.''  With his beautiful and spirited wife Elaine always by his side, Dan then moved his family to Anchorage to head up the Alaska Housing Finance For 18 years, he managed HFC's nearly $5 billion in assets. It is not an overstatement to say that he revolutionized that agency, doing remarkable things, including and most importantly helping thousands of Alaskans--thousands of our constituents, our fellow Alaskans--pursue their dream of buying an affordable home. There is nothing more important than that.  The Alaska Legislature just passed a bill to name the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation the Daniel Fauske Building, and the dedication ceremony will take place in Anchorage on  As his bio indicates, there is no doubt that for decades Dan Fauske served Alaska with his hands, his heart, and with his head. But a bio on paper can only tell you so much about a person; to really appreciate him, you would have to have been with him and watched the energy and can-do spirit radiate from Dan You had to watch him talk to people with respect and humor and understanding and a very keen intelligence.

12249,topic-id,520,"Mr.President, I rise today with a warning about S.34. This measure undermines the privacy of all Montanans and all It is a measure I strongly oppose because it takes the refs off the field, leaving consumers at the whim of internet service providers. It allows these companies to sell our data--to sell my data--and to snoop through your search history and to track the sites we visit. In other words, it allows internet companies to make a profit by invading your privacy. It gives them the ability to collect and sell your physical location, information about your children, your health, finances, Social Security number, and web browsing history. In fact, this legislation even extends to apps and your social media accounts.  Following the vote that we had here on this floor, a Republican State senator from Buffalo, MT, proposed an amendment to our State budget to push back against this irresponsible resolution. In my home State of Montana, folks on both sides of the aisle are deeply concerned about their right to privacy. Now folks you don't even know can have access to the websites you visit, and they can have this access without your consent.  This is another troubling step that folks in Congress have taken this year to violate the rights of privacy of law-abiding citizens. We already have a CIA Director who has advocated for the most intrusive acts of the PATRIOT We have a Supreme Court nominee before us who supports the government's ability to reach into the private lives of law-abiding Now Congress is rolling out the red carpet for major corporations to collect and sell our personal online information.  Enough is enough. I am here today to provide a voice for all Montanans and all Americans who value their right to privacy, who expect their elected officials to defend civil liberties, to stand up for constitutional rights, and who do not want private information collected and shopped around like a used book on  When the President decided to sign this resolution last night, he ushered in the latest significant threat to our right to privacy. Now it is the responsibility of service providers to protect our personal information online.  I think folks in Montana and across this country have the right to question the priorities of those who supported this resolution. Everyone has a fundamental right to privacy, and the government shouldn't be in the business of violating those individual rights, especially when doing the bidding of big companies looking to make more profits at the expense of people's privacy.  I want it to be known in this body that Montanans don't want anyone snooping around in their private lives, neither the government nor corporations. It is fundamental to our Montana values.

When government agencies like the NSA collect bulk data, they do so at the expense of our freedoms. If Mr.Sessions is not willing to protect our Fourth Amendment rights, can we expect him to fight for other constitutional rights?  Will he fight for the First, the Second, the Fifth?

12347,topic-id,913,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in strong support of the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United I do that as someone who has known him personally quite well for 6 years now. I want to do this briefly because we are pressed for time, but I want to make a few points.  First, I think we all recognize the terrific credentials that Senator Sessions brings to this job--his career, his lifetime serving his country, from his time in the U.Army Reserve, to his 12 years as a U.attorney, to the 2 years he spent as the attorney general of Alabama, all before being elected to the U.But much more importantly, I am so impressed by this good man, this good and decent man's commitment to protecting all members of our society and his sense of fairness. Let me give a couple of examples.  It was Senator Sessions who worked with a Democratic colleague, Senator Coons, on legislation to help women and children who were victims of abuse. It was Senator Sessions who joined me in our successful effort to provide hundreds of millions of dollars of additional funds each year to victims of child abuse and sexual assault and domestic violence.  Senator Sessions' sense of fairness is also illustrated in his approach to law enforcement. It is probably widely known that he has the endorsement of every major law enforcement group in America, but Senator Sessions has also spent a lot of time and effort making sure people on the other side of law enforcement are treated fairly and humanely.  It was Senator Sessions who led the successful effort to eliminate the disparity in sentences for crack users versus cocaine users, working with Senator Durbin, a They succeeded because Senator Sessions understood that the disparity--the much harsher penalty on the use of crack cocaine versus white powdered cocaine--was completely unfair and overwhelmingly adversely affected African That was not acceptable to Jeff  It was Senator Sessions who in 2003 joined with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy in introducing and helping to successfully enact the Prison Rape Elimination Act because of his concern about the appalling abuse experienced by some people in our prisons. That was not acceptable to Jeff  Let me just say that--I am going to be very candid. The most objectionable and offensive slander I have heard against Senator Sessions is the notion that somehow he has some kind of racist leanings. That is an outrageous and dishonest charge. I have known this man very well. There is not a racist bone in his body. This is a man who has been endorsed by many, many African-American leaders. This is a man who personally took on the KKK every chance he had when he was serving as the U.attorney. In fact, arguably, he was the reason that the law enforcement--in fact, he personally did probably more than anyone else to bankrupt the KKK by design so that he could destroy that organization in Alabama, which is exactly what he succeeded in doing.  Jeff Sessions is a man who has tremendous respect for the law, a reverence for the law, respect for the rule of law. There is absolutely no question[[Page S959]]in my mind, from my own personal experience with him for these years, that he will enforce the law vigorously and fairly.  Several of my Democratic colleagues have come down here and they have rattled off policy areas in which they disagree with Senator You know what, there are areas where I disagree with Senator I guarantee you, there are lots of areas where I had disagreements with the members of President Obama's But it never occurred to me to expect that I would have complete agreement on every policy issue with every candidate for a Cabinet position.  What I know about Jeff Sessions is that he is an extremely well-qualified attorney, with outstanding credentials, has spent his adult life serving his country and his State, that he has gone to the mat to work for people who are some of the least fortunate and people who have been through appalling circumstances. He has been their champion. I just know he is going to stand up for the principles of the rule of law and equal justice before the law.  The last point I want to make is, when Republican Senators gather periodically for our lunches and our private discussions, every Republican Senator knows that when we are discussing something, if Jeff Sessions believes that we are talking about doing something that is a violation of a principle that he holds, he is going to be the first guy who is going to stand up, and he is going to say: My colleagues, this would be a mistake. This is not the right thing to do.  He is the one who is the first to stand up to any other member of the conference; it doesn't matter who it is. If he thinks what they are suggesting is not the right thing to do, not the principled thing to do, not consistent with our role as Senators, not consistent with our principles, Jeff Sessions is always willing to stand up for what is right.  He will stand up for what is right as the Attorney General of the United I am proud to support him, and I urge all of my colleagues to do likewise.  I yield the floor.

President Trump doesn't want to hire a team that will represent the American people.

12290,topic-id,803,"Mr.President, as I reflect on the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General, one of the things that hits me is, when we look at the broad scope of how America has been moving forward in the last 100 years, the three big movements that have changed America have been the civil rights movement; the women's rights movement--women's suffrage, women's rights, women wanting freedom over their choices on reproductive rights; and then conservation and environmental rights, which have kind of changed everything since Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt and my father and Uncle Mo Udall, who served in the  I grew up believing civil rights was something that was moving us forward, was inclusive, and was something where we really cared about every person.

I have told many of them back home the story I learned through my father and through his public service, when he was a college student at the University of  Both he and my Uncle Morris Udall were at the University of Arizona in the lunchroom. Way back in the 1940s, the lunchroom was segregated so the Black students had to eat outside under the trees. They couldn't eat inside. My father and Mo had a friend, a young man by the name of Morgan Morgan still is a good friend of the family, and I am good friends with his son who lives in New  Morgan was sitting out under the tree, and Mo and my father went over and said: We want you to have lunch with us. They took him through the line at the University of The[[Page S913]]people serving looked at him like they were a little shocked and surprised. They said: He is our friend. He is going to have lunch with us. They served him, and they sat down at the lunch table in the lunchroom. It ended up that they had a good lunch that day.  But that push to bring Morgan Maxwell, a Black student, into a segregated lunchroom ended up with the president of the university facing a decision: Was he going to discipline the Udall brothers or was he going to change the rule and integrate the lunchroom? Thank God, he integrated the lunchroom, and the University of Arizona, at that time, moved forward with integration.  I had always heard that story, and it resonated with me a lot. Then, later, as I was growing up here in Washington when my father was Secretary of the Interior, there was a great commotion around the fact that the Washington Redskins was the last team in the NFL to integrate their team. Here, we are talking in the 1960s. The owner of the Washington Redskins was named George Preston Everyone knew he was a bigot and racist. He said: This is never going to happen. We are not going to integrate the So there was a big movement in Washington to get my father to do something about it.  He took this in a serious way and passed it on to the The Solicitor came back and said: Stewart, actually, you can do something about it. The stadium resides on Park Service property and you are the landlord. Tell him next year when he gets his lease, if his team isn't integrated, you can terminate the lease, or he can integrate. George Preston Marshall raised hell and went to Jack Kent and Bobby Kennedy at Justice and did everything they could to push it aside. The Kennedys backed my dad.  I know my colleague Senator Hirono is here.  The short story is that the Washington Redskins got Bobby Mitchell and had the first winning season the next year in a long, long time.  Those civil rights are things you grow up with. They are things you want to move forward with. That is why I rise today to say I am deeply disturbed about what Coretta Scott King said about Jeff Sessions in 1986 when he was going to be promoted. As U.attorney, he chilled the free exercise of vote by Black citizens. That is how he carried out his responsibilities.  I think if you look at the whole history here, he is not fit to be Attorney General, and that is why I am going to vote no, and I urge everybody to vote no.

12301,topic-id,1072,"Mr.President, I also rise today to voice my concerns about Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as U.Attorney While I respect Senator Sessions' public service, I cannot and will not support his nomination.  I also rise to raise the concerns of thousands of my constituents who have contacted me about Senator These Virginians worry about what his confirmation would mean for the rights of all Virginians and all  Senator Sessions' long record of opposing bipartisan, commonsense policies relating to voting rights, anti-discrimination, domestic violence, and criminal justice reform leads me to conclude that he is not the right person to serve as Attorney  I would like to take a couple of minutes--and I know I have my friend the Senator from Minnesota coming after me--to talk about five areas of concern I have with his nomination.  First, voting rights. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County v. Holder to gut a key section of the Voting Rights Senator Sessions applauded that decision which eroded voter access and protection in several States once covered by the preclearance provisions in the Voting Rights Those States included the Commonwealth of Moreover, he has failed to support important legislation that would restore those protections.  The bipartisan legislation, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, was introduced last Congress and would serve to once again protect our Nation's hard-fought equal access to the ballot. I was proud to cosponsor this bill and remain committed to working with my colleagues to put a fair process in place that ensures our elections are open to all. Senator Sessions unfortunately opposed this legislation.  The second area is nondiscrimination. I also have concerns about Senator Sessions' record on a broad range of anti-discrimination provisions. He was one of only four Senators to oppose an amendment in the Judiciary Committee that would have reaffirmed the principle that the United States does not discriminate against immigrants on the basis of religion--an issue that unfortunately has reared its head most recently by the President's action.  He opposed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which codifies protection for LGBTQ Americans, and denies the reality that too many of our LGBTQ neighbors still face down discrimination and hatred every day.  While nearly two-thirds of the Senate voted for the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009, Senator Sessions stated this instead: ``I'm not sure that women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just don't see it.''  From opposing the DREAM Act, to opposing the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, Senator Sessions' views are well outside of the mainstream.  The third area is the Violence Against Women In 2013, Senator Sessions voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women This landmark legislation, originally drafted in 1994, provides crucial protections and resources for the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women. The 2013 reauthorization bill updated those programs within the Department of Justice and extended resources and protections to additional populations, such as those in same-sex relationships. That bill passed with the support of a large bipartisan majority in the Senate, including a majority of the Republican caucus. However, Senator Sessions opposed the entire bill due to concerns about one provision in the legislation related to domestic violence against Indians on tribal lands.  We in the Senate have all on occasion been faced with legislation that contains one or more provisions that we have concerns about or would not have included in the legislation. Yet my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can attest that we very often strike compromises to get important legislation over the finish line. Oftentimes the sign of a good bill is when not one of us gets 100 percent of what we may have wanted. Opposing a much broader, commonsense bipartisan bill meant to reduce violence and protect domestic violence victims calls into question Senator Sessions' commitment to administering these important programs at the Department of  Fourth, various sentencing reforms. There is broad, bipartisan recognition in the Senate that our broken criminal justice system is badly in need of reform. Likewise, there is bipartisan support for updating outdated statutes that tie judges' hands and often force them to hand down overly punitive mandatory minimum sentences. Yet last year Senator Sessions again was one of only five Republicans on the Judiciary Committee to vote against this bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation, of which I am a proud cosponsor, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections  There is overwhelming support both in this body and among the American public for reforming a broken justice system and giving thousands of Americans a second chance to be productive members of society. I believe that Senator Sessions' views on criminal justice are at odds with what the American people want and at odds with the basic principles of fairness and equality under law that are supposed to be the hallmark of our Nation's justice system.  Finally, on the question of independence, I am concerned that Senator Sessions won't be sufficiently independent to execute the responsibilities of Attorney General effectively. Doing this job the way our Founding Fathers intended requires a certain level of impartiality to fully and independently enforce our laws and protect the rights of the disenfranchised. Senator Sessions has said achieving this level of neutrality means saying no to the President sometimes.  This is one area in which I agree with my colleague and very much want to[[Page S918]]take him at his word; however, given his vocal, partisan support for President Donald Trump and his refusal to commit in his confirmation hearing to fully enforce certain laws, I am not convinced that Senator Sessions is fully prepared to faithfully execute this new set of responsibilities with the amount of independence that the job demands.  Again, I stress that the main duties of serving as Attorney General include enforcing our Nation's laws and by doing so, protecting the civil rights of all That is the most basic tenet of being Attorney Given Senator Sessions' long record of opposing many of these fundamental laws that protect civil rights and equality for all, I have grave concerns about him fulfilling and taking this position.

12181,topic-id,409,"Mr.President, today I wish to congratulate the National Historic Oregon Trail Interpretive Center in Baker, OR, on its 25th anniversary and to recognize the cultural and historical importance of this special place. Twenty-five years ago, volunteers, philanthropists, and community leaders came together with the Bureau of Land Management to make this dream a reality, and today I want to honor them for their dedication to their community and the State of Oregon.[[Page S1889]]  Since 1992, the Interpretive Center has brought to life the story of the Oregon Through life-size displays, historical artifacts, and live performances by historical interpreters, visitors to the center are transported back in time to the first days of Baker What started as a small goldmining town grew through the years as more emigrants arrived. These pioneers had fought through challenging conditions and traveled thousands of miles to reach Oregon, but had they not persevered, the growth of this State could never have taken place. We owe it to those who blazed the trail before us to listen to their story, and we owe it to ourselves to take their lessons of perseverance, innovation, and community spirit to heart.  It is no coincidence that the community that came together to make the Interpretive Center possible, shares the characteristics of their ancestors. In the 1970s, Baker City was struggling to keep up with a changing economy. It took the innovative vision of modern-day pioneers, who recognized the cultural importance of this place, to bring its rich history back to life. Joining forces with the Bureau of Land Management, community leaders worked together to create the Interpretive Center and jumpstarted Baker City's growing tourism industry.  Over 25 years, this community has continued to contribute to the sustained success of the Interpretive From the hard-working caretakers of the center's 4 miles of interpretive trails, to the philanthropy of individuals like the late Leo Adler who help sustain the center financially, the people of Baker City demonstrate every day the same spirit as the pioneers they honor. In this way, the story of the Interpretive Center mirrors the very story it tells.  It stands today as a living testament to the value of learning from our past. Therefore, I wish today to not only celebrate this milestone, but to encourage us all to reflect on the example set by both the pioneers of the Oregon Trail and those who continue to blaze new trails for their communities every day.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1888-3.txt,1247,25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL HISTORIC OREGON TRAIL INTERPRETIVE,2017.0,21.0,January
