                              NOMINATIONS

  Mr. McCONNELL. On another matter, today, the Senate will continue to 
fulfill its important responsibility of providing advice and consent on 
President Trump's nominations. So far this week, we have confirmed 
talented individuals to important positions in the Departments of 
Transportation, Labor, and Defense.
  Yesterday, the Senate advanced the nomination of Joseph Otting to 
serve as Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Otting's experience as a 
leader in various financial agencies has helped prepare him to serve in 
this new role. I look forward to voting to confirm him later today.
  Next, the Senate will consider two well-qualified nominees to serve 
on Federal district courts. Donald Coggins and Dabney Friedrich both 
have the experience and temperament to excel as judges. Both of these 
individuals have stellar legal credentials. Their careers demonstrate a 
serious commitment to the law, and by confirming them both, the Senate 
will continue to ensure the Federal judiciary fulfills its particular 
role in our constitutional system.
  I would like to thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, which reported both of these nominees on a 
voice vote. I look forward to advancing their nominations very soon.
