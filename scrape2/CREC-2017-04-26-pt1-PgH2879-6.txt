            CONVICTED CRIMINAL ALIENS KEEP COMING TO AMERICA

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 40-year-old Mexican national Oscar 
Perez Rangel had already been deported twice. He left the United States 
with a host of felony convictions, including attempted robbery by 
firearms and illegal reentry. But holes in the U.S. border allowed the 
outlaw to sneak back into the U.S. a third time.
  Here in the U.S., Rangel's girlfriend ran a daycare center. It was 
there that he set his sights on a next victim--an unsuspecting 12-year-
old girl. For 3 months, he molested and raped her.
  Finally, he was caught and charged. Eventually, he will be turned 
over to ICE and deported again.
  Mr. Speaker, we must have the moral will to secure the border. 
Criminals who violently assault, rape, and pillage America are slipping 
back into the country under the radar. We must prevent criminal aliens 
like Rangel from reentering our country after they are legally 
deported.
  Secure the southern border. Do it now, or there will be more 12-year-
old victims.
  And that is just the way it is.
