                       TRIBUTE TO DORA SPAULDING

 Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and 
honor an exceptional Vermonter, Dora Spaulding, who this year is 
celebrating 50 years of dedicated service to the students at the Marion 
Cross Elementary School in Norwich, VT.
  Ms. Spaulding has been the administrative assistant at the Marion 
Cross School for the past 10 years and was secretary to the principal 
for 40 years prior to that. Her story is all the more impressive when 
one considers that Dora Spaulding attended Marion Cross School herself, 
from first to eighth grade. It is hard to imagine today, but Dora was 
the only girl in her entire first-grade class.
  As the school's administrative assistant, Ms. Spaulding is 
responsible for the payroll, purchasing, bus transport arrangements, 
facility rental schedule, and other administrative tasks for the 
school, but more than that, she is, in many ways, the face of the 
school. In fact, several members of my staff grew up in Norwich and 
attended the Marion Cross School and speak highly of her many 
contributions to the students, school, and the community.
  Dora Spaulding embodies the spirit of dedicated public service. I 
applaud her for helping to steward countless young people over the past 
50 years and for her tremendous commitment to education and 
community.
