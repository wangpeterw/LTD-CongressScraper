                         HONORING MARK HAWKINS

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and congratulate Mark 
Hawkins, who will retire tomorrow after 29 years as chief executive 
officer of Altura Credit Union in Riverside, California.
  After nearly three decades, Mark's greatest contribution is likely 
not to the credit union, which grew significantly under his leadership, 
but to the members of our community who have benefited so much from his 
commitment to supporting the Inland Empire.
  Whether it is academia, athletics, the arts, or charitable 
organizations, Mark has been a fixture in promoting the institutions 
that define and enrich our community. His work with organizations, 
including the United Way, the Kiwanis Club, and the University of 
California-Riverside, has strengthened our community and expanded 
opportunities to thousands of Inland Empire residents. I know he will 
continue that work for many years to come.
  Once again, I congratulate Mark on his well-earned retirement, and I 
thank him for his continued service to our community.
