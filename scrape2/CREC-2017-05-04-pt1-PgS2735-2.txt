  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today's prayer will be offered by our guest 
Chaplain, Father Patrick J. Conroy, the Chaplain of the U.S. House of 
Representatives.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Lord God, we are astounded by the bountiful flow of Your 
blessings. We thank You for the gift of this day that we receive from 
Your generous bounty.
  Inspire our lawmakers to use these precious hours and minutes for 
Your glory. Help them to understand that when they have an awareness of 
the brevity of their days on Earth, it will provide them with hearts of 
wisdom.
  Bless also and strengthen the many staffers who provide the wind 
beneath the wings of our leaders.
  We pray in Your Holy Name.
