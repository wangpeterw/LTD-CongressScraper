                   HANNAH AHLERS WAS THE ``COOL'' MOM

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, I plan 
to speak on this floor about each victim who lost their life during the 
terrible shooting on October 1 in Las Vegas. My goal is to honor their 
lives and to ensure that they will never be forgotten.
  Today I rise to remember Hannah Ahlers, a loving wife, mother, 
daughter, sister, and friend, whose life was taken far too soon.
  Hannah lived in Beaumont, California, and had traveled to Las Vegas 
with her husband, Brian, and three other couples to attend the Route 91 
Harvest music festival.
  Friends and family have described Hannah as a beautiful person inside 
and out, who was full of joy, and always went out of her way to help 
her friends and family.
  Her commitment to her friends, family, and community was felt by 
everyone. She could light up the room at any moment she walked in. Her 
father-in-law described her as a young Mary Tyler Moore.
  She was also an amazing and devoted mother to her three children, 
Briannah, Brice, and Hailey. Her kids' friends thought she was the cool 
mom, and they loved to be around her. She lived her life to the 
fullest, and enjoyed both the simple pleasures and outdoor thrills, 
like the skydiving community she was a part of.
  I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Hannah's friends and 
family. Please know that the city of Las Vegas in Nevada and the whole 
country grieve with you. This is a tragedy that should have never 
happened.
