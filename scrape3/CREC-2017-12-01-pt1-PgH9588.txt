                NO FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES

  (Mr. CULBERSON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, over a year ago, Kate Steinle, a young 
woman in San Francisco, was murdered by a criminal illegal alien and 
died in the arms of her father.
  At that time, as chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations, I swore that I would 
do whatever it would take to cut off every dollar of Federal money to 
every sanctuary city in America.
  I persuaded the previous Attorney General to put that policy in 
place. Thankfully, with President Trump's election and the appointment 
of our new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, they moved aggressively to 
enforce existing laws, secure our border, and restore respect for the 
rule of law in this great Nation.
  It is appalling and outrageous that a jury in San Francisco acquitted 
the killer who murdered Kate Steinle. This should renew our zeal as the 
Representatives of the people of this country to restore respect for 
the rule of law by cutting off every dollar of Federal money to every 
sanctuary city in American and to do whatever it takes to protect our 
citizens from criminal aliens who enter this country illegally and then 
commit crimes against the people of this great Nation.
  What happened in San Francisco is an outrage, and I will not rest 
until we cut off every dollar to every sanctuary city in the United 
States of America.
