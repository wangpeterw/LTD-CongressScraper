                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  You have blessed us with all good gifts, and with thankful hearts, we 
express our gratitude. On this National Peace Officers Memorial Day, we 
thank You for the faithful service of the men and women in blue who 
serve our Nation in towns and cities across this country. Keep them 
safe as they keep watch for our safety.
  We ask Your blessing as well upon the families and precincts who have 
lost fellow officers in the line of duty, especially mindful of those 
who have paid the ultimate price this past year. May they be blessed 
with Your comfort and consolation.
  In this moment of prayer, please grant to the members of this 
people's House, as they meet with their respective constituents, the 
gifts of wisdom and discernment that in their words and actions they 
will do justice, love with mercy, and walk humbly with You.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
