                   TWO YEARS OF THE FAILED IRAN DEAL

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 2 years 
since the previous administration capitulated to the dangerous Iran 
deal, a one-sided agreement that rewarded the regime in Tehran with a 
$1.7 billion ransom of pallets of unmarked currency for four hostages 
and put our allies, including Israel, at risk. The Iran deal emboldened 
the authoritarian regime.
  Just last month, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley correctly 
pointed out that Tehran has engaged in destructive and destabilizing 
actions, both testing ballistic missiles and engaging in arms 
smuggling.
  This week, Senators Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and David 
Perdue, sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urging him 
not to certify Iran's compliance with the Iran deal as the deadline 
approaches.
  Refusing to certify Iran's compliance with the Iran deal would send a 
clear message that President Donald Trump is committed to peace through 
strength and refuses to comply with a ridiculous deal that puts 
American families at risk.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
