     RECOGNIZING PERKASIE'S 108TH COMMUNITY CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTING

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday evening, Santa Claus will 
arrive in the Borough of Perkasie atop a borough electric truck to 
light the town's Christmas tree and, in doing so, continue a tradition 
over 100 years old.
  Since 1909, residents of this small borough in upper Bucks County 
have gathered together to participate in the community tree lighting 
ceremony recognized as the oldest tree lighting in the Nation. While a 
lot has changed over the generations, community leaders, elected 
officials, and local residents have kept this annual event's unique, 
small-town charm and enshrined it as a timeless Christmas ritual.
  Now in its 108th year, this official start to the holiday season 
continues to serve not only as a source of pride for the people of 
Perkasie, but also an example of what makes the communities across my 
district special and an honor to represent.
  I am proud to recognize Perkasie's 108th community Christmas tree 
lighting and join in the celebration of this enduring holiday 
tradition.
