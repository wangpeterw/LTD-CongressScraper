             TAX REFORM BILL PRESERVES ADOPTION TAX CREDIT

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the importance of 
adoption and what Congress can be doing to help more kids get adopted 
into loving, caring families.
  November is National Adoption Month, and it is time we talk about how 
the GOP tax reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, will help children 
in need of loving families by supporting those whose lives have been 
touched by adoption.
  Our tax reform bill preserves the adoption tax credit, which allows 
taxpayers to claim expenses related to the adoption of a child, 
including fees, court costs, and travel expenses. This credit 
ultimately helps get more children into permanent, loving families, and 
the credit costs only about $3.8 billion over 10 years, a small 
fraction of our overall budget.
  Mr. Speaker, I worked tirelessly with my colleagues to ensure that 
this adoption tax credit was included in the House's tax bill, and I am 
pleased that the Senate's version also preserves it in their draft.
  I urge my colleagues to work quickly to pass tax reform that 
preserves the adoption tax credit while bringing tax relief to all 
American families.
