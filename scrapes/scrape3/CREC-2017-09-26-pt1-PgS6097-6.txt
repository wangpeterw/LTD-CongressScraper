          PUERTO RICO AND U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS RECOVERY EFFORT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, we have seen all the 
serious problems facing the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands as a result of recent hurricanes. The damage has been terrible. 
The latest hurricane was especially devastating.
  We want the people of Puerto Rico and the islands to know that we are 
thinking of them, and, more importantly, we want them to know that we 
will continue to work with FEMA, the Department of Defense, and the 
rest of the administration to help in the recovery.
  I expect we will hear more soon on what additional resources will be 
necessary in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the paths of the storms. The 
recovery effort is certainly not going to be easy. It is not going to 
be quick. But we are here to do our part.
