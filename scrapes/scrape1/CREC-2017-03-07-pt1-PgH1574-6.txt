                      THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H1575]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be an adherent of the 
Constitution, as I know that my colleagues are. We believe in the 
separation of the three branches of government.
  That is why it was so noteworthy and so outrageous that the leader of 
the free world and Commander in Chief issued a patently irrational 
email or Twitter on Saturday morning this past Saturday regarding a 
personal and direct attack on the past President of the United States 
of America regarding that President having wiretapped this individual 
in an outrageous manner.
  Let me cite for you headlines in the Houston Chronicle: FBI chief 
seeks Trump rebuke of that horrible statement.
  I ask the Department of Justice to immediately respond to Director 
Comey's request that you rebuke this outrageous statement that would 
accuse the President of any wiretapping that require either a Title III 
court, DEA, FBI, or require a FISA court.
  Mr. President, explain yourself.
  Justice Department, respond to this untruth now.
  The Constitution requires it, and the separation of the three 
branches of government, out of respect, requires it.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to direct 
their remarks to the Chair.
