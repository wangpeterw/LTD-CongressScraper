                         TRIBUTE TO DREW LINGLE

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Drew Lingle, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Drew is a graduate of Century High School in Bismarck, ND. Currently, 
he is attending Minnesota State University Moorhead, where he is 
majoring in history. Drew is a dedicated worker who has been committed 
to getting the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Drew Lingle for all of 
the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years 
to come.
