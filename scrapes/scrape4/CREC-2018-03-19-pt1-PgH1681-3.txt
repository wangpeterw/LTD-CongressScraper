                CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
the University of Houston men's basketball team on their remarkable 
performance in the 2018 NCAA Tournament.
  The Cougars entered the tournament as the number six seed from the 
American Athletic Conference, led by the 2018 AAC Coach of the Year 
Kelvin Sampson. This was the Cougars' first NCAA tournament appearance 
since 2010, and their spectacular win in the first round against San 
Diego State was the Cougars' first NCAA Tournament win since 1984. 
Their loss against Michigan in the second round was hard fought and 
truly a heartbreaker.
  As an alumnus of the University of Houston and on behalf of the city 
and the fans, we are proud at what they accomplished this season. I 
wish the team the best of luck for next season.
  I would also like to give special congratulations to seniors Devin 
Davis, Wes VanBeck, Nura Zanna, and Rob Gray for an exciting season.
  Go Cougars.
