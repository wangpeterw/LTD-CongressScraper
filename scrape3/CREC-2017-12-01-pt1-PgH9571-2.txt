                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Living God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  As we face a new day, help us to discover the power of resting in 
You. Send Your spirit down upon the Members of the people's House. 
Grant them wisdom, insight, and vision that the work they do will be 
for the betterment of our Nation, and help them to identify and bring 
to pass policies that will redound to the benefit of our children and 
grandchildren.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
