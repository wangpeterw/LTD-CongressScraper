                      WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE ACA

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, while the Senate is moving forward this week 
on their deeply flawed and really unpopular healthcare bill, millions 
of Americans know that they will lose healthcare under TrumpCare. They 
will face skyrocketing costs, premiums will go up, prescription drug 
prices will go up.
  Republicans need to drop this obsession with repeal and work with 
Democrats to fix the problems that we know exist in the Affordable Care 
Act. No law is perfect. At least no law that has ever been written here 
is perfect.
  And the American people, at least the folks I talk to back home, they 
are exhausted. They are sick of this partisanship. We have some ideas 
that you might like. You have some ideas that maybe we could accept. We 
ought to get together and figure out a way to make healthcare work for 
every American and not obsess about the notion that anything signed by 
the previous President, by definition, is bad law.
  Let us do what the American people sent us here to do.
