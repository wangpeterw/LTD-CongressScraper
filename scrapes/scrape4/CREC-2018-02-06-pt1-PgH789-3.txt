                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  Bless the Members of the minority party as they prepare to gather 
these next days. May they, with those who accompany them, travel safely 
and meet in peace.
  Bless, also, the majority party as they return to their 
constituencies. Give them hearts and ears to listen, to listen well to 
all those whom they represent.
  May the work that needs to be done presently result in progress 
toward addressing the needs of the Nation to the benefit of all.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
