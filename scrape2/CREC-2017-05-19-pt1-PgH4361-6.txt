                           DRUG COURT SUPPORT

  (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of drug courts 
and veterans treatment courts in America.
  No one disputes the issues of rampant drug use and abuse in our 
Nation and the tremendous hardship it is placing on families, on 
businesses, and our criminal justice system. Recently, I met a 
remarkable young man from Arkansas who epitomizes the critical need to 
expand these lifesaving programs.
  Blayne was facing 20 years in prison because of a 10-year addiction 
to opioid prescription drugs that spiraled out of control while 
experimenting in college. Today he is a father to three beautiful 
children, owns his own home, and is giving back to his community--all 
because a drug court in Arkansas saved him.
  This month is National Drug Court Month. Drug courts represent one of 
our Nation's most successful strategies for intervention.
  I support drug courts and veterans treatment courts. I am counting on 
my colleagues to ensure they are properly supported and funded. The 
return on investment is incalculable.
