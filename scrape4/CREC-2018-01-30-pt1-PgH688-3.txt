                        REMEMBERING DARBY WORTH

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember 
Darby Worth, an activist, a community member of my hometown, and most 
importantly, she was one of the teachers at my elementary school.
  Mrs. Worth, as I knew her, worked 20 years at Tularcitos Elementary 
School, the school where I went and my daughters go today. Now, I 
didn't know that at the time, but many years ago before she was a 
teacher, she was well versed in environmental and social activism.
  By the time she did take up teaching, she had already traveled to San 
Francisco many times to protest the Vietnam war. Well after she retired 
from Tularcitos, Darby was unrelenting in her commitment to social 
justice, women's rights, challenging corporate power, and, yes, 
fighting climate change.
  She had many movements that she was behind, and it is understandable 
considering that she felt strongly that everything is interconnected. 
That is why, at 90, she was already planning and fighting the county to 
be buried in her front yard.
  Madam Speaker, I am not sure if she was laid to rest in that 
location, but I do know that Mrs. Worth will always be remembered not 
for just being a teacher to children, but because of her 
interconnectivity to all of us. She was somebody that we all learned 
from.
