                  WE NEED TO PUSH FORWARD ON TAX CUTS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as the House contemplates the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act, a lot of misinformation is getting around the country on 
that.
  The intent here is to make the Tax Code simpler; the ability for 
Americans to spend instead of billions of hours and billions of dollars 
combined in dealing with their taxes, to get it down to a simple form, 
perhaps a postcard for many Americans, and the ability to weed through 
their taxes and get them done and put more money in their pockets.
  What our plan does is put approximately $1,200 into the average 
middle-income family's pocket, leaves it there instead of taking it 
out; also, restoring more opportunity on Main Street for small 
businesses, medium businesses, and the jobs that we want to come back 
home to this country, those trillions of dollars we can repatriate back 
to this country and help the middle class, help middle-income 
Americans, help everybody to have a stronger, more vibrant economy, 
which helps everybody, instead of a complicated Tax Code put together 
by lobbyists.
  We need to push forward on this and have a success for the American 
people.
