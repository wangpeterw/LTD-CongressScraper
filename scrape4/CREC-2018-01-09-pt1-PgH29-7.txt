       EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE IN HAITI

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, this Friday, January 12, marks the 
eighth anniversary of the devastating earthquake that took the lives of 
250,000 Haitians and left unimaginable destruction. Local south Florida 
organizations, led by Haitian Women of Miami, will hold a silent march 
at 4 p.m. this Friday to mark the occasion, walking from Northwest 62nd 
Street to North Miami Avenue to the Little Haiti Cultural Center.
  These past 8 years, the people of Haiti have shown incredible 
resolve, even after being hit by Hurricanes Matthew and Irma recently, 
and, sadly, there is still much work to be done, Mr. Speaker.
  Many Haitians came to the United States after these natural disasters 
seeking safety and security. Sadly, the administration terminated the 
Temporary Protected Status, TPS, to these individuals, forcing them to 
return to a devastated Haiti that is still struggling to rebuild.
  As we mark this sad anniversary, we must reaffirm our commitment to 
helping Haiti move forward, and that must start by calling upon the 
administration to reverse its decision to terminate TPS for Haiti.
