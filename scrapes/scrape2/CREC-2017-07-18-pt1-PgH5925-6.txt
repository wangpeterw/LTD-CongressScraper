  HONORING THE MEMORY OF WEST VIRGINIA CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE JOHN YODER

  (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life and memory of West Virginia's Circuit Court Judge John Yoder, who 
passed away on June 7, 2017.
  Judge Yoder served on the 23rd Judicial Circuit, which included 
Berkeley, Jefferson, and Morgan Counties in the eastern panhandle of 
the Second Congressional District, which I represent. He practiced law 
in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, for 23 years.
  Judge Yoder earned a bachelor of arts degree at Chapman University, 
and then studied law at the University of Kansas. He also obtained an 
MBA at the University of Chicago.
  John Yoder was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 to serve 
as the director of the asset forfeiture office for the U.S. Department 
of Justice. He continued his distinguished career as a public servant, 
including two stints as a West Virginia State senator before being 
elected as circuit court judge.
  Judge Yoder is one of the early pioneers of State drug courts and was 
well known for his big heart and compassion. I join all West Virginians 
in keeping Judge Yoder's family and friends in our prayers. He will 
truly be missed.
