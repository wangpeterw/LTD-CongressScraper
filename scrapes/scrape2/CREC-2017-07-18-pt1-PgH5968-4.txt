                       RECOGNIZING SCOTT WALDRUP

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Scott Waldrup who was a victim of violent crime during the Fourth of 
July festivities in Savannah, Georgia.
  A Cary, North Carolina, native, Mr. Waldrup came to Savannah in 2011 
to join the city's booming food service industry. He tirelessly worked 
in the industry until he became the general manager at one of 
Savannah's most popular restaurants, The Grey.
  Mr. Waldrup certainly never knew a stranger. His family and friends 
described him as being adventurous and bold, yet caring and selfless.
  During the violence in Savannah that night, Mr. Waldrup selflessly 
helped others to safety until he was hit by the gunman's car during a 
police chase to apprehend the criminal. By all accounts, Mr. Waldrup 
was a hero.
  I wish his family, his friends, and his coworkers the best during 
this very, very difficult time. I will certainly be thinking about all 
of them.
  I encourage others to learn from Mr. Waldrup's example and hope his 
life serves as a reminder of the tragedies involved in violent crime 
and deter others from acting violently and recklessly.
