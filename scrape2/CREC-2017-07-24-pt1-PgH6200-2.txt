               SUPPORTING NATIONAL HOUSING WEEK OF ACTION

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today in support 
of National Housing Week of Action and to stand up for a better deal 
for hardworking Americans.
  Access to affordable housing directly impacts the ability of 
Americans to have a better job, better wages, and a better future. 
However, far too many families are struggling to keep a roof over their 
heads as the cost of rent is rising, mortgages are harder to get, and 
wages remain stagnant.
  Due to cuts in Federal rental assistance, only one in four people 
eligible for it actually are receiving it. Our constituents deserve a 
better deal. I join Democrats in standing up to create millions of 
good-paying jobs, full-time jobs by investing in our crumbling 
infrastructure, and offering apprenticeship programs to new workers.
  Mr. Speaker, I will continue to fight for affordable housing programs 
so all Americans can have the ability to achieve the American Dream.
