                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God of grace and truth, the center of our lives, hallowed be Your 
Name. Lord, help us to live in a way that will bring glory to You. May 
people see our passion for You and desire to know You more fully.
  Continue to guide our lawmakers. Protect them in their work and lead 
them away from those things that bring dishonor. Surround them with the 
shield of Your protection and presence.
  O God, support us all the day long, until the shadows lengthen and 
the evening comes, and the busy world lies hushed and the fever of life 
is over and our work is done. Then in Your mercy give us a safe lodging 
and a holy rest and peace at last.
  We pray in Your powerful Name. Amen.
