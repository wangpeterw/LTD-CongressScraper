                  BENEFITS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the lifesaving impact 
of the Affordable Care Act.
  This week, I have heard from dozens of constituents who have been 
calling my office and reaching out on social media to tell me their ACA 
stories.
  I heard from one constituent whose mother had two devastating lung 
diseases. While she had good insurance, unfair lifetime spending caps 
priced her out of receiving the lifesaving treatment she needed. When 
the Affordable Care Act passed, we ended the cruel practice of lifetime 
spending caps. With these new protections, she was able to resume her 
treatment and stay healthy to spend time with her daughter and 
granddaughter.
  Mr. Speaker, the ACA works. It reduces healthcare costs, enables 
young people to stay on their parents' insurance, and ensures low-
income and struggling families that they can access the care they need.
  If Republicans repeal this law without a viable replacement, there 
will be real consequences to real people. Let me be clear: by repealing 
the ACA, Republicans would end healthcare coverage for millions of 
families, put the insurance companies back in charge, and, yes, make 
America sick again.
  I urge my colleagues to consider what is at stake here--real costs, 
real lives, not just a political football.
  Let's do the right thing and protect families' health care.
