                           GO HOUSTON ASTROS

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, go Astros.
  In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, so many impacted, our boys of 
summer brought it home this weekend. In the words of David Barron: 
``With their season on the line, the Astros drew comfort from the 
familiar ground on which they stood, the sea of noise that greeted 
their every move, and the collective will that exemplifies the way they 
played and the city they represent.''
  Astros strong, Houston strong.
  I am so delighted to have a friendly wager with a dear friend. I 
don't know for how long. I think he represents the Brooklyn--oh, the 
Los Angeles Dodgers.
  I yield to the gentleman from California, and whether he will accept 
this friendly wager, I offer you Texas barbecue, Congressman Jimmy 
Gomez.
  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.
  In the spirit of good sportsmanship, I accept the gentlewoman's wager 
and the barbecue that I will get to enjoy next week.
  The Houston Astros are an amazing team, with 101 wins, but the 
Dodgers are better, with 104. I know that the Astros stumbled across 
that finish line to make it to the World Series. I know it is going to 
be a hell of a game between the two teams.
  If we lose, I will bring some French dip sandwiches from the 
Louisiana institution, Philippe's, in downtown Los Angeles.
  Let the best team win. Play ball.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Reclaiming my time, barbecue is good everywhere in 
Texas.
  Where there is a will, there is a way. The Astros have the will and 
the way.
  Go Astros.
