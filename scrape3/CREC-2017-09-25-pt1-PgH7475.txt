                  TEXAS COACHES FIGHT HURRICANE HARVEY

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, undaunted by the massive 50 inches 
of hammering rains and devastation of Hurricane Harvey, Texans quickly 
volunteered to help other water-soaked neighbors.
  Bay City High School Secretary Linda Leissner was manning the city's 
emergency operations call center when she realized the city needed 
school buses and drivers to help in the rescue because of Harvey's 
quickly rising floodwaters, so she called the coaches. The coaches 
quickly manned the high school's buses, and in the torrential rain they 
began rescuing and evacuating residents of the town, including some of 
their very own students.
  One of the coaches, Nathan Janak, put it best: ``It was just people 
helping people. It was one of the greatest displays of human kindness I 
have ever seen.''
  Madam Speaker, stories like this make us Texas Proud and give us the 
determination to recover from one of the worst natural disasters in 
U.S. history. Harvey will not defeat us. As we say, ``Don't mess with 
Texas.''
  And that is just the way it is.
