                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Lord and God, we would not journey through this day without 
contact with You. Increase our faith, hope, and love, that we may 
receive Your promises.
  Be merciful to our lawmakers and fill them with Your hope. May they 
be fully persuaded in their minds about receiving guidance from You for 
the decisions they make.
  Lord, deliver them from a reluctance to respect honest differences as 
they remember their ultimate accountability to You. Provide them with 
Divine insights as they grapple with complexities that require nuanced 
choices. May their ultimate goal be to serve You by doing what is best 
for our Nation and world.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
