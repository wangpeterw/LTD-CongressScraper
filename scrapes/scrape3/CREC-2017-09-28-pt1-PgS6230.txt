   SENATE RESOLUTION 273--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF 
 SEPTEMBER 2017 AS ``SICKLE CELL DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH'' IN ORDER TO 
EDUCATE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ABOUT SICKLE CELL DISEASE 
     AND THE NEED FOR RESEARCH, EARLY DETECTION METHODS, EFFECTIVE 
TREATMENTS, AND PREVENTATIVE CARE PROGRAMS WITH RESPECT TO SICKLE CELL 
DISEASE, COMPLICATIONS FROM SICKLE CELL DISEASE, AND CONDITIONS RELATED 
                         TO SICKLE CELL DISEASE

  Mr. SCOTT (for himself, Mr. Booker, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Brown, Mr. 
Rubio, Mr. Coons, and Ms. Warren) submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 273

       Whereas sickle cell disease (referred to in this preamble 
     as ``SCD'') is an inherited blood disorder that is a major 
     health problem in the United States and worldwide;
       Whereas SCD causes the rapid destruction of sickle cells, 
     which results in multiple medical complications, including 
     anemia, jaundice, gallstones, strokes, restricted blood flow, 
     damaged tissue in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and death;
       Whereas SCD causes episodes of considerable pain in the 
     arms, legs, chest, and abdomen of an individual;
       Whereas SCD affects an estimated 100,000 individuals in the 
     United States;
       Whereas approximately 1,000 babies are born with SCD each 
     year in the United States, with the disease occurring in 
     approximately 1 in 365 newborn African-American infants and 1 
     in 16,300 newborn Hispanic-American infants, and is found in 
     individuals of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Asian, and 
     Indian origin;
       Whereas more than 3,000,000 individuals in the United 
     States have the sickle cell trait and 1 in 13 African-
     Americans carries the trait;
       Whereas there is a 1 in 4 chance that a child born to 
     parents who both have the sickle cell trait will have the 
     disease;
       Whereas the life expectancy of an individual with SCD is 
     often severely limited;
       Whereas, while hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
     (commonly known as ``HSCT'') is currently the only cure for 
     SCD and advances in treating the associated complications of 
     SCD have occurred, more research is needed to find widely 
     available treatments and cures to help patients with SCD; and
       Whereas September 2017 has been designated as Sickle Cell 
     Disease Awareness Month in order to educate communities 
     across the United States about SCD, including early detection 
     methods, effective treatments, and preventative care programs 
     with respect to SCD, complications from SCD, and conditions 
     related to SCD: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Sickle Cell Disease 
     Awareness Month; and
       (2) encourages the people of the United States to hold 
     appropriate programs, events, and activities during Sickle 
     Cell Disease Awareness Month to raise public awareness of 
     preventative care programs, treatments, and other patient 
     services for those suffering from sickle cell disease, 
     complications from sickle cell disease, and conditions 
     related to sickle cell disease.
