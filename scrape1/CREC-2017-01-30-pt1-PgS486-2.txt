                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I was unable to cast my vote on 
the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Rex W. Tillerson to 
be Secretary of State because I was addressing a joint session of the 
State legislature in New Mexico. If I had been present, I would have 
voted no.
