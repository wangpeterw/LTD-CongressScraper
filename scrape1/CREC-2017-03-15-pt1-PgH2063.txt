                   THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING DACA

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to stress the importance of 
maintaining Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, commonly known as 
DACA.
  DACA recipients were brought here to the United States as children, 
and in most cases America is the only home they have ever known. They 
want to contribute to our economy, to our society, and our country; and 
they will, unless we are foolish enough to stop them.
  Taking any step against DACA would not only hurt DACA recipients, it 
would hurt the United States. Let's protect these promising youth and 
keep this program intact while we work out a humane path to 
citizenship.
