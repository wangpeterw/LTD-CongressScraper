                      HONORING MISS NORTH CAROLINA

  (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Miss Greater Sampson 
County, Victoria Huggins, who won the 80th Miss North Carolina 
Scholarship Pageant this past weekend and will go on to represent our 
great State in the Miss America pageant this fall.
  During the competition, Victoria also won first place in the Quality 
of Life Award which honors her dedication and work on her community 
service platforms.
  A graduate of the University of North Carolina at Pembroke and a 
native of St. Pauls, Victoria is a member of the Carolina in the 
Morning team with the NBC affiliate WECT in Wilmington, North Carolina.
  During her tenure as Miss North Carolina, Victoria will focus on her 
work advocating for Alzheimer's disease awareness.
  On behalf of southeastern North Carolina, congratulations, Victoria. 
We wish you the best of luck as you represent our great State over the 
next year, compete in the Miss America pageant, and continue to enrich 
the lives of others.
