                             THANKING SNAPa

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I will meet 
with leaders from the School Nutrition Association of Pennsylvania, 
commonly called SNAPa, which is a statewide organization of school 
nutrition professionals.
  SNAPa works to advance quality child nutrition programs through 
education and advocacy. Organized in 1955, SNAPa is an all-volunteer 
board of directors elected by its member, which currently stands at 
more than 2,300 individuals.
  As chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition and a senior 
member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I know the 
essential services that SNAPa works to provide. Students throughout the 
Commonwealth receive high-quality, low-cost meals thanks to SNAPa.
  Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember that, for some students, the 
only meal that they receive is at school. This organization works to 
keep our children healthy and ensure that they have healthy food 
options through school meal programs. SNAPa is recognized as the 
authority on school nutrition in Pennsylvania.
  I sincerely thank SNAPa for advancing the availability, quality, and 
acceptance of school nutrition programs as an essential part of 
education in Pennsylvania for more than 60 years.
