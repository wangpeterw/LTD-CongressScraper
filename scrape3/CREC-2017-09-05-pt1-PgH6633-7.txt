                                  DACA

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today because I am fired up. I am 
angry about the decision that the President made today on DACA.
  I want to thank the thousands of people who have risen up across this 
country--from Houston, to Philly, to Los Angeles, to Denver--to say 
that they are going to have their voices heard. They need to continue 
to sound that voice.
  What about the promise the government made to these young people that 
said: If you come forward and come out of the shadows, we are going to 
protect your information? What about that promise?
  I want every DREAMer to know that I stand with them and that I am 
going to fight like hell here in Congress to make sure that we protect 
them and to make sure that we honor the promise that we made. These 
people are our doctors, our teachers, our neighbors, and, in my case, 
my cousin.
  I call on Congress and my colleagues across the aisle who have been 
speaking up on this issue in support of DACA protections to do more 
than speak, and to act--to act now and to act fast.
