                      KEEPING OUR CHILDREN INSURED

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of 
helping children who, through no fault of their own, have no health 
insurance. These are children who are ineligible for Medicaid, and 
their family cannot afford private insurance. CHIP, or Children's 
Health Insurance Program, helps these children receive coverage.
  In Kansas, more than 79,000 vulnerable children are enrolled in CHIP. 
That is why I have worked to preserve and strengthen it during my time 
in Congress.
  Last month, I voted for reauthorizing CHIP for 5 more years, through 
2022. This invaluable benefit to kids in Kansas and across the country 
was included as part of a bipartisan bill called the CHAMPIONING 
HEALTHY KIDS Act, which passed the House last month and now awaits 
further action in the Senate.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass 
this bill and reauthorize the important CHIP program to ensure that 
families and children who rely on this program remain covered.
