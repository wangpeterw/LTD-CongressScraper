     RECOGNIZING ROSE ANN SHANNON IN HONOR OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH

  (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I rise to 
recognize a woman dedicated to journalistic integrity, who made history 
as Omaha's first female TV news director. Rose Ann Shannon recently 
retired after 45 years in TV news and was a mentor to many local and 
national reporters.
  When Rose Ann started her career at KMTV in 1973, she was one of only 
three women in Omaha TV news. After KMTV, Rose Ann worked as a 
communications director for Omaha's mayor, then returned to TV news at 
KETV. She was then promoted to news director, the first female TV news 
director in Omaha. KETV's general manager said Rose Ann exemplified 
``integrity-first journalism at its core.''
  Rose Ann is a trailblazer who shattered a glass ceiling. She served 
as a mentor to men and women in the industry, ensuring reporters 
connected to the public through ``integrity-first reporting and 
truth.''
