                             RURAL AMERICA

  (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank President Trump for 
his strong support of rural America and for remembering the forgotten 
farmer.
  Last week, the President made us so very proud when he became the 
first sitting President in 25 years to address the Farm Bureau. During 
his speech, the President emphasized the importance of agriculture in 
America. And as a member of the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee 
on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies, I could not agree more.
  Our farmers provide America with food security unlike any other 
country on Earth. Farmers and ranchers are a small percentage of our 
population, feeding, fueling, and clothing our country and the rest of 
the world. But it hasn't been easy for them. Foreign countries cheat 
our farmers with unfair trade practices. Unelected bureaucrats have 
strangled our farmers with regulation after regulation. And even your 
elected officials have tried to tax our farmers to death. As a result, 
farm income has been on a drastic and steady decline until now.
  So I thank the President for not forgetting about rural America; and 
I thank him for rolling back job-killing regulations, calling out 
corrupt trade practices, and pushing Congress to ease the burden of the 
death tax.
  My farm friends in Mississippi thank the President.
